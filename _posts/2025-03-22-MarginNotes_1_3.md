## Introduction

Writers have spilled rivers of ink over the term "ideology." This steady
flow has become a deluge of mediocre tomes from uninquisitive minds. The
result of this flood is that the term now usually connotes a mere
pejorative rather than anything of substance. Anyone who wishes to avoid
submersion must seek higher ground. Yet academia has shown itself to be
a lowland compared to those who have merged theoretical insight with
practical activity. It is little wonder, then, that the most coherent
conceptions of ideology come from those who stand in large part outside
the academy. For this reason, any investigation into ideology must start
with the insight of the Young Marx, who noted that philosophy had
contended itself with criticizing thought in its abstract form. This was
a half-complete task; it did not criticize the real conditions which
give rise to illusory abstractions.<d-footnote>See Karl Marx, "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's *Philosophy of Right*: Introduction" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 1978), 53-65.</d-footnote> If the Young Prussian was
correct that on the other side of the antinomy stood the proletariat,
ready to pick up theory as a weapon of its own emancipation, then it
should be unsurprising that the most thorough critics of ideology stand
on its side.

The ambiguous relationship of the Frankfurt School to academia provided
fertile ground for a critical theory of ideology. This ambiguity was not
of the members' volition. Misfortunes asserted themselves upon the group
but also allowed for reason to work its cunning. The concept of ideology
played a central role in the Frankfurt School from the time of
Horkheimer's ascent as director of the *Institut für Sozialforschung*
(IfS). Of course, the Frankfurt School was not the first to investigate
the concept. Indeed, one of the first treatments of the concept in the
Frankfurt School corpus criticizes extant theories of ideology. However,
by dint of their influence and voluminous output, the Frankfurt School's
conception of ideology is a watershed moment in the development of the
concept. At its head during these halcyon years was Max Horkheimer, who
somewhat facetiously accepted previous director Carl Grünberg's
description of the IfS as a "dictatorship of the director."<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "The Present Situation of Social Philosophy" from *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, trans. G. Frederick Hunter, Matthew S. Kramer, and John Torpey (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1993), 11.</d-footnote> His
productive flurry during his stint as the head of the IfS deserves
special consideration for both its historical breadth and theoretical
acumen. It is for this reason that the essay will focus predominantly on
Horkheimer, though it will at times refer to other members of the IfS as
needed.

Horkheimer's 1930 critique of Karl Mannheim's *Ideology
and Utopia* is a fruitful starting point for an explanation of the
critical theory of ideology. Mannheim's theory not only has historical
importance but is also a useful case study in how abstract and
value-free theories of ideology content themselves with retreating to
abstraction rather than explaining how ideology functions in the social
reproduction of concrete life. By contrast, the theory of ideology that
the *Institut für Sozialforschung* develops is an antidote to these
common maladies. Hence, this essay first describes Horkheimer's
criticism of Mannheim in section 2 before laying out the concept of
ideology that Horkheimer developed during the 30s. Those unfamiliar with
Mannheim's sociology of knowledge should consult Appendix 3 to orient
themselves before continuing.

After laying out Horkheimer's critique of Mannheim, the essay then turns
to Horkheimer proper. This section, section 3, forms the bulk of the
essay (for obvious reasons), and is for that reason divided into
subsections. Subsection 3.1 mainly summarizes the main problems with the
sociology of knowledge and lists the pitfalls that a critical theory of
ideology should avoid. Next, subsection 3.2 distinguishes between
*Ideologietheorie* and *Ideologiekritik*, and I argue that these two
moments of a critical theory of ideology are both present in
Horkheimer's early work. As one of the primary pitfalls of the sociology
of knowledge is its methodology, subsection 3.3 covers methodological
matters, arguing that the proper means to analyze ideology in capitalist
social relations requires the adoption of a dialectical method. After
the methodological background, subsection 3.4 deals with ideology
*theory*, arguing that Horkheimer's conception of ideology views it as
playing a specific *functional* role in class relations. Subsection 3.5
deals with the other half of the formula: the *critical* moment of the
critical theory of ideology. Throughout this analysis, one sees the
contraposition of ideology as falsehood to the concept of *totality*.
Consequently, subsection 3.6 provides some further contextualization of
totality as a concept. As the reader may wish for a concrete example of
the critical theory of ideology, I end section 3 by recapitulating
Horkheimer's analysis of the bourgeois revolutionary and applying it to
Tommaso Campanella. The essay then concludes by flagging some further
areas for research.

## Horkheimer's Critique of Mannheim

Horkheimer begins his critique of Mannheim with a methodological point.
Mannheim treats Marxist thought as part of his "sociology of knowledge"
which explains a social totality. Yet the *true* purpose of Marxist
thought is to change the world, not to explain it.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "A New Concept of Ideology"? from *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, trans. G. Frederick Hunter, Matthew S. Kramer, and John Torpey (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1993), 129.</d-footnote> While Horkheimer
sees some value in Mannheim's work, he does not think it beyond
reproach. Mannheim sees the purpose of the sociology of knowledge as not
a partisan tool but as a "sociological history of thought." This
intellectual field seems impossible to water, as even the sociologist's
worldview is situationally determined. Hence, the prospect of
impartiality in the sociology of knowledge is grim. The sociology of
knowledge aims to provide us a way out of the academic crisis of the
era, in which "faith in the unconditional validity of the various world
views \[sic\] has been fundamentally shaken."<d-footnote>Ibid., 130.</d-footnote>

Mannheim distinguishes between *particular* and *total* ideologies. The
former consists in ascribing the origin of a *specific* belief to bias
or interest. By contrast, the latter casts doubt on an entire opposing
*Weltanschauung*. Much like Kant's claim that the
judgments of experience are the result of our application of the
categories, Mannheim argues that our worldviews are the result of
categories that are the result of our given situational determination.
We thus do not think universally; our social group conditions our
thought. Thus, not only *what* we know is subject to situational
determination, but *how* we think. Hence, the charge of false
consciousness has become universalized. Though he invokes false
consciousness, Mannheim wants a generalized version of ideology that is
not restricted to Marxism.<d-footnote>Ibid., 131.</d-footnote> While Mannheim claims that the total
conception of ideology has its *origins* in Marxist thought, accusations
of total ideology are somewhat novel.<d-footnote>Ibid., 130.</d-footnote> To prevent lapsing into
philosophical relativism, Mannheim distinguishes between his thesis of
situational determination and relativism. The former merely entails that
all thought is ultimately rooted in "a definite social situation."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote>
This *sociological* claim does not require the sociologist of knowledge
to take sides and give a moral *evaluation* of an ideological dispute.
The sociologist of knowledge is not an ethicist. They do not judge the
moral soundness of a worldview, but only describe it. In effect,
Mannheim's system is the *inverse* of the meta-ethical expressivism that
would become popular a few years later in the Anglosphere.<d-footnote>See A.J. Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic* (London, Penguin Books: 1971).</d-footnote> For both
the expressivist and the sociologist of knowledge, there is a strict
fact-value distinction. Hence, there is also a strict separation between
the act of describing a claim and judging its moral status.<d-footnote>Though perhaps in different ways, since the expressivism in vogue at the time held fast to a positivism wherein every truth was either analytic a priori or a posteriori, empirical, and contingent. Hence Mannheim's Kantian leanings might rub at odds with the Anglophone dismissal of the synthetic a priori.</d-footnote> For the
expressivist, moral claims do not *describe* any mind-independent facts
about ethics. Moral language only expresses the speaker's approval or
disapproval of the act in question, or aims to arouse similar sentiments
in others.<d-footnote>Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic*, 110-1.</d-footnote> The sociologist of knowledge *describes* the
sociological fact that people's ideas spring forth from their
situational determination without commending or condemning. Just as the
expressivist is not in the business of describing the world, the
sociologist of knowledge is not in the business of judging it.

Despite this point of agreement with expressivists, Mannheim is no
positivist. His approach diverges from positivism due to his insistence
on the *historical* element of truth. While positivism held fast to the
adage that "facts are stubborn things," Mannheim insisted that there was
no ahistorical unified truth that could survive unblemished. Rather, the
validity of a system of thought depends on its historical moment.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 132.</d-footnote>
Ideologies have a temporal validity. What was once a valid system of
thought may lose its validity. By contrast, some ideologies are
*utopian* because their appearance is too hasty. Utopian ideologies are
invalid *now* but gain validity *later*.<d-footnote>The obvious example here (though Horkheimer does not give it explicitly) is the utopian socialism of Thomas Müntzer, the Conspiracy of Equals, Fourier, Saint-Simon, and Robert Owen, all of whom saw the utopian element of socialism but whose appearance *pre festum* meant that the categories of thought had were ill-suited to a historical situation with insufficiently developed productive forces.</d-footnote> Thus, the sociologist of
knowledge determines the truth or falsity of an ideology in relation to
a definite historical period. Hence, false consciousness is
theoretically and normatively antiquated consciousness. It is a
consciousness whose retrograde elements *obscure* rather than *clarify*.
The historical moment is the yardstick by which one measures the truth
of an ideology. Thus, contra the logical empiricists, truths are not
independent, ahistorical entities, but *dynamic*.

To return to 1930, Mannheim diagnoses methodological pluralism as the
cause of the crisis in thought.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 133.</d-footnote> Each thought system can grasp bits
of the truth and reconcile it to its methodological best practices. But
differences in individual social standpoints entail that there is a
seeming lack of organic unity in the present. At present, there are
several ideologies that are at least in part irreconcilable. These stem
from different ways of looking at the world that are situationally
determined. The sociology of knowledge seeks to overcome intellectual
fragmentation by attempting to stand outside ideologies. In so doing, it
aims to show ideologies to be the result of definite historical
processes, with the aim of freeing people from their historical
determinations.<d-footnote>Ibid., 134.</d-footnote>

The trouble is that Mannheim misuses Marx. Marx "wanted to transform
philosophy into positive science and praxis."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim eschews this
task and returns to metaphysics. Mannheim wants to use the sociology of
knowledge to reach a higher truth that stands outside the constraints of
ideology. Yet he also claims that the truth we reach is not "valid for
all times and for all human beings."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim is far from the only
person whose denial of a generally valid philosophical system leads to
problems.<d-footnote>Per Horkheimer, this is also a problem for Dilthey, who thought we could understand human nature in retrospect. Dilthey's appeal to some Ur-principles makes sense given the rest of his philosophical commitments, but this is not a route available to Mannheim.</d-footnote> Still, his conflation of the development of humanity
inside ideologies and historical progress outside the realm of ideology
renders ideological entities metaphysically strange.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept,", 135.</d-footnote> Mannheim's
theory cannot appeal to an atemporal human essence given his commitment
to the claim that our beliefs are situationally determined. Despite
this, he still appeals to an abstract, atemporal human essence. Mannheim
wants to *both* have the plurality of ideologies point to a situational
determination of total ideologies which cast doubt on a unifying human
essence, and at the same time appeal to some transhistorical humanity,
"the essence of which all existing persons carry within
themselves."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim makes the same mistake that classical
idealist philosophy made. That is, he posits humanity as a metaphysical
entity that is unlike any other and does not correspond to the lives of
flesh and blood people. But the argument for giving human essence a
prime position in the theory is weak. Abstract humanity is an entity
which stands outside the behaviors and motivations of sensuous human
activity. It thus cannot explain real human behavior and thought. In
effect, Horkheimer shows that Mannheim's appeal to human essence falls
prey to a Mackie-esque Argument from Queerness.<d-footnote>See J. L. Mackie, *Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong* (Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1977), 38-42.</d-footnote> If there *were* a
human essence, it would be an entity "of a very strange sort, utterly
different from anything else in"<d-footnote>Ibid., 38.</d-footnote> Mannheim's sociology of knowledge.
The concept of a general total conception of ideology militates
*against* some transhistorical essence which escapes situational
determination. Thus, the entire edifice of Mannheim's theory rests on a
foundational essence which the theory states cannot exist.

A similar problem befalls Mannheim's conception of history. This theory
does not point to determinate historical entities but appeals to a
"realm beyond history."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 137.</d-footnote> Once again, Mannheim confuses the concept
of humanity as such for flesh and blood people. The *real* struggles
which claim the lives of millions in their conflagrations \"are not the
'real' things toward which our investigations are directed.\"<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote>
Rather, what counts is the conceptual apparatus which changes according
to one's situational determination. Reality *as such* holds no
importance beyond the conceptual apparatus through which one views it.
But does this not *also* apply to the concept of a transhistorical human
essence? Once one forgoes the appeal to transcendent humanity, then one
is only left with the claim that standpoints are an important part of an
overall historical process. Manheim even imbues this belief with a
mystical flair which gains a secularized coat of paint via an appeal to
historical processes. Again, Horkheimer criticizes Mannheim for his
inconsistency. The latter eschews the idea of an eternally valid
viewpoint, but qualifies this by claiming that "the ontological
decisions according to which we experience and analyze facts
increasingly reveals an overarching meaning."<d-footnote>Ibid., 137-8.</d-footnote> But his appeals to
humanity are themselves ideological at base. Mannheim's appeals to
"essence" and "humanity" depend on a conceptual apparatus that his
sociological framework casts doubt upon. Even if there *were* such
abstracta, Mannheim's system gives us a reason to believe that we would
be categorically unable to know them. Much like Mackie's critique of
ethics, *if* some transcendent meaning of history existed, our knowledge
of it could only occur through "some special faculty of \[...\]
perception or intuition, utterly different from our ordinary ways of
knowing everything else."<d-footnote>Mackie, *Ethics*, 38.</d-footnote> Appealing to metaphysical systems which
posit such entities as a given is not a solution. These systems are ones
which Mannheim's system gives us reason to doubt.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 138.</d-footnote>

Despite his Kantian pretensions, Mannheim's sociology of knowledge
requires dogmatism to buttress it. This is not a problem for the
revolutionary critique of ideology, as it tries to do away with
metaphysical superstitions. By contrast, Mannheim seeks to ossify them.
Marx was correct to cast doubt on abstract humanity as a substitute for
flesh and blood men. Hence, Mannheim views the human essence as the
subject of history, but for Marx it is the concrete human being "in a
definite historical moment."<d-footnote>Ibid., 139.</d-footnote> To insist on the former is to think
ideologically and dismiss "the real sufferings of economically
underprivileged classes."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> History, then, "cannot possibly be the
expression of some meaningful whole,"<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> but is the result of
contradictions between men. Materialism has no predefined schema; it
cannot stipulate some *telos* of history. To do so would let it lapse
back into the very vagaries it attempts to avoid. Mannheim appeals to
abstract entities like a human essence to avoid the charge of
relativism. Yet the charge of relativism itself is based on a static
ontology which is suspect.<d-footnote>Ibid., 140.</d-footnote> There is no transcendent principle of
truth to which to appeal. Hence, Mannheim's own relativization of all
conceptions is itself relative. Horkheimer notes that since "all our
ideas \[...\] depend upon conditions that may change, \[...\] the notion
of an eternal truth which outlives all perceiving subjects is
untenable."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This does not entail scientific skepticism. While the
content of the claims that science makes (e.g., about nature) extend
beyond the lifetime of humanity, the claims themselves "express
something about the relationship of humanity and nature \[...\] but
nothing about the relation of truth and being in general."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote>
Mannheim, by contrast, judges the charge of relativism by the yardstick
of eternal truth. Despite this, his system casts doubt on eternal truth
*tout court*.

For Mannheim, particular ideology is particular because the conditional
nature of the determining social situation bars the bearer of any
particular ideology from making claims to absolute truth. But the claim
of situational determination is incoherent, since it presumes that it
itself is not situationally determined; it thereby treats standpoints
under the aspect of eternity.<d-footnote>Ibid., 141.</d-footnote> Similarly, Mannheim intended
situational determination to avoid the charge of relativism by focusing
on the pragmatic upshot of beliefs. But this confuses the true and false
with genuine and spurious. Mannheim treats the concept of ideology as
one which has intensified and radicalized over time. It blossoms from a
particular ideology to a total conception of ideology. From there, the
specialized total conception of ideology allows for a general total
conception of ideology. This general total conception of ideology
creates the possibility of a sociology of knowledge. This sketch
includes the claim that ideology has become so totalized that one may
treat it with systematic rigor. Yet Horkheimer claims that this
unrelenting focus on the general does not do justice to the
particular.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> To trace the implications of ideology, as Mannheim
does, does not necessarily make it a good theoretical tool. Many
scientific theories have failed to prove useful after deep inquiry.
There is no guarantee that Mannheim's theory of ideology would prove
different.

Moreover, Mannheim depoliticized ideology, especially in the move
between particular and total conceptions of ideology. In so doing, he
worsens the analysis by failing to account for the link between the
political and economic distribution of power and the social concepts in
play.<d-footnote>Ibid., 142.</d-footnote> When moving to the total conception of ideology, one must now
subject an entire *Weltanschauung* to ideological critique. In so doing,
Mannheim stresses the need to treat nearly everything as ideological.
This universalization transforms the concept from a definite accusation
to dogmatic metaphysics. This itself is a manifestation of false
consciousness. It replaces interests or empirical facts with a vulgar
reflection theory as the explanans. Mannheim must also reject modern
psychology, which explains the development of men's ideas in terms of
their external needs. For Mannheim, the development of ideas does not
depend on real people's lives, but from their social strata.<d-footnote>Ibid., 143.</d-footnote> This
"correspondence of form"<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> occurs not only at the level of economic
class (as is the case in Vulgar Marxism), but also implies a distinct
set of aesthetic, metaphysical, and moral categories in the members of
the stratum. Mannheim's theory relies on ideal types of people, to whom
correspond beliefs and worldviews. In doing so, one can afterward
"reconstruct" the social situation in which the ideology emerges. This
reconstruction should avoid value judgments. This process prevents one
from viewing the social situation as a totality, as it reduces it to a
mere amalgamation of different viewpoints. Moreover, such a total
conception of ideology proves to be as much of an "idealistic
overextension"<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> as the concept of a human essence. The total concept
of ideology depends on the notion of a totality of consciousness, a
totality "in the sense of a superficial concept of the whole."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote>
While such a totality has merit in biology and psychology, it cannot be
the case in ideology. This is because people's consciousness is bound up
with the social and environmental surroundings. That is, it is
intertwined with definite material social relations.<d-footnote>Ibid., 144.</d-footnote> This does not
entail a strict mind-to-world parallelism. The development of a person
does not always mirror the development of their society.
*Weltanschauungen* do not develop apart from the socioeconomic
conditions in which they appear. To pretend that they are freestanding
intellectual constructs is idealist nonsense. Mannheim eschews the
non-autonomy of thought from material conditions in favor of a
psychological framework which emerges in a sociohistorical reality. In
so doing, he merely reinvents the Hegelian *Volksgeist* with different
verbiage. By ignoring the role of power and struggle, Mannheim treats
the relationship between an individual and his ideology as if it were
deterministic rather than as the result of everyday struggle.<d-footnote>Ibid., 145.</d-footnote> Thus,
for Mannheim, the struggle between ideologies stands apart and above the
struggle between definite individuals. At one plane of struggle is the
struggle of determinate individuals, on another is a struggle between
ideologies. The relationship between these two planes is unclear at
best.

By a *general* total concept of ideology, Mannheim means that
intellectuals understand that situational determination limits *every*
ideology, including one's own. As such, no ideology can reach eternally
valid truth. This renders every pattern of thought ideological. Since
Mannheim strips ideology of its accusatory nature, he renders it
meaningless. Now, the term merely signifies that a claim lacks access to
a mind-independent truth. All ideologies are born in the original sin of
situational determination. To be consistent, one must give an account of
the categories that one is using, including what "being" and
*Weltanschauungen* are. In contrast to the general total concept of
ideology is the *special* conception of the total concept of ideology.
In the special conception, one merely puts into question *competing*
ideologies. The special conception shows promise in giving an account of
the relevant categories.<d-footnote>Ibid., 146.</d-footnote> This is most prominent with Mannheim's
ambiguous relationship to Marxism. When talking about the special
conception, Mannheim uses Marxism as the ideology with which to
criticize all others. On the other hand, Mannheim treats Marxism as one
ideology among many which is subject to the critiques of the general
conception of total ideology. Thus, Mannheim critiques Marxism but
appeals to certain categories of class society uncritically. But without
*some* categories of thought, situational determination loses its
meaning, as there are no sociological structures which determine
individuals' ideological beliefs. Without an account of society,
Mannheim's account of situational determination falls apart because it
is underdefined. Thus, each ideology may use its own categories when
defining situational determination. Marxists can interpret it along
lines of social classes and relations of production while idealists may
interpret it according to *Volksgeister*, and so on. Mannheim's
invocation of a social situation is too vague. Horkheimer approvingly
cites Troeltsch, who claims that "society" is an ambiguous term and
overly abstract unless anchored in economic relations. As it stands,
though, the sociology of knowledge lacks the categories which can carve
society into the ideal types to which ideologies are situationally
determined. This renders it meaningless.

A similar problem applies to Mannheim's notion of ideological
appropriateness. Mannheim also must resort to a spiritual examination of
the criteria of ideological appropriateness. He grounds the
appropriateness of an ideology to its "correctness" to its time (i.e.,
not obsolete or utopian). But this correctness is itself not based on
"an explicit, scientific theory of society."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Thus, correctness
becomes arbitrary, epoch-based, and circular. Consider Mannheim's
example of an obsolete ideology: that of a landed proprietor who still
views his *de facto* capitalist estate through the lens of feudal social
relations. If viewing the estate in this way is obsolete, it is so
thanks to some *non-ideological* metric. Basing "one's commitment to
this theory on the grounds of its appropriateness to the epoch, which is
precisely the basis upon which the theory is to be judged, would be
circular."<d-footnote>Ibid., 148.</d-footnote> Mannheim restricts the analysis of ideology to the
cognitive realm. This makes the landowner's failure a mere epistemic
matter. In doing so, he ignores the *social* function of ideology: i.e.,
how ideology shapes reality. As a result, Mannheim's analysis of
ideology is one-sided and overly abstract. It analyzes social life as it
stands but otherwise leaves social life unexamined. Even when analyzing
a specific *Weltanschauung*, Mannheim does not connect the ideology to
its social effects or the relations that bearers of that thought have to
the world around them.<d-footnote>Ibid., 149</d-footnote> Despite its sociological façade, Mannheim's
sociology of knowledge contents itself with reintroducing a
pseudo-Hegelian philosophy of *Geist* that Marx superseded. Hence,
Horkheimer concludes that "Mannheim distinguishes himself from those
irresponsible philosophers whose blindness he claims is caused by their
persistence in a \"higher realm\" (104) only in that he returns there
himself with a few weapons from the arsenal of Marxism."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote>

## A Critical Theory of Ideology

### A Negative Example

At first glance, Mannheim's sociology of knowledge provides us with an
excellent *negative* example: that is, an example which shows us what to
*avoid*. There are 3 interrelated problems with the model that one would
be wise to avoid. First, Mannheim's model posits strange metaphysical
entities which should not exist by the model's own suppositions. These
entities include the appeal to a transcendental, ahistorical humanity.
The theory of situational determination cannot explain the existence of
such entities. The ideal type which corresponds to an ideology is
another example. It putatively stands in for groups of flesh and blood
people. Yet this entity stands over and above the conceptual schema that
said flesh and blood people use in everyday life.

This is due to a second pitfall with the model, Mannheim's attempt to
give a value-free analysis of ideology *causes* him to rely on such
metaphysical entities. The net result of this is that, despite its
scientific pretensions, the sociology of knowledge *loses* explanatory
power when compared to a less metaphysically cumbersome theory. This is
most notable with the pseudo-normative concept of utopia. A utopian
ideology is a state of mind which "is incongruous with the state of
reality within which it occurs."<d-footnote>Karl Mannheim, *Ideology and Utopia: An Introduction to the Sociology of Knowledge* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979), 173. Annoyingly, despite Louis Wirth being involved in both this translation and the translation used in the Horkheimer translation, the pagination is different.</d-footnote> Describing an ideology as utopian
runs into one of two problems. Either it is circular, as appropriateness
to the era is the "basis upon which the theory \[of utopia\] is to be
judged,"<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 148.</d-footnote> or it posits a temporal appropriateness as some entity
which stands *outside* situational determination. If the latter is the
case, then the theory of utopia must rely on a concept of
' "nonideological" correctness:'<d-footnote>Ibid., 147.</d-footnote> an entity which the theory says
cannot exist, as such an entity would have to stand *outside*
situational determination.

The concept of utopianism falls prey to a third problem with the theory.
That the quasi-normative description of utopianism does not solve the
previous problem because Mannheim adds the normative concepts *post
hoc*. Hence, the concept has no grounding in the theory itself. The
extent to which utopianism *is* a normative concept is unclear. By
reducing ideology to a cognitive framework, Mannheim reduces utopianism
to a mere epistemic fault.

What would a critical theory of ideology that avoids these pitfalls look
like? Remarkably like that of the early Frankfurt School. Thus, what
follows is a sketch of the critical theory of ideology as present in the
*Institut für Sozialforschung* during its heyday in the 1930s, a sketch
which avoids the pitfalls of the sociology of knowledge.

### Roadmap

At this juncture, one must distinguish between two interwoven but
nonetheless distinguishable tasks that any critical theory of ideology
must provide. On the one hand, it must provide an *Ideologietheorie*: a
theory of how ideologies function and the role they play in larger
social structures. On the other hand, it must provide an
*Ideologiekritik*: it must show that the ideologies in question obscure
or render unintelligible some facts of social life. The received wisdom
regarding the Frankfurt School is that it had the latter but lacked the
former. This received wisdom is false, as it ignores the way in which
both concepts are intertwined for the first generation of Critical
Theorists. In what follows, I show that the Frankfurt School's
development of an *Ideologietheorie* is rather quite prominent, so long
as one knows where to look. In particular, the Frankfurt School's
functionalism places ideology within the context of capitalist social
relations. Afterward, I show that the Frankfurt School's *adjectival*
conception of ideology provides the critical half of the equation,
giving ideology an *obfuscatory* role regarding immanent contradictions
in social relations.

A few words on what constitutes a critical theory of ideology are in
order. The *critical* element is not vacuously filled by any subjection
of assumptions to scrutiny. Indeed, this element is ostensibly part of
the most vulgar bourgeois critiques of ideology that emerged during the
early modern period, i.e., the ascendent era of capitalism in Europe.
However, the articulation of ideology critique in capitalist society
both then and now is class-based, as Horkheimer notes that "the
criticism of the system \[of relations that reproduce capitalist social
life\] is to be the prerogative of those who have an interest in
it."<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Concerning Resentment" from *Dawn & Decline* (New York: The Seabury Press, 1978), 31.</d-footnote> Criticism in the bourgeois sense is counterposed to
*resentment*, which is reserved to those "who have the opportunity to
know \[capitalism's\] underside."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Bourgeois thought in its
skeptical form is welcoming toward criticism, so long as "critical
tendencies \[are\] voiced only toward fantasies---so-called
ideologies---and not at all toward things as they are."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Montaigne and the Function of Skepticism" from *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 296.</d-footnote> This
renders criticism impotent as it considers theory as "relative and
separate from praxis."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This impotence stems from a misconception
about the relationship between ideology and materialism: "the foundation
of authoritarian domination lies not in the delusions with which it
rationalizes itself, but in the social structure of production that
rules the age and shapes of the character of human beings according to
their place within it."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Hence, for the Frankfurt School,
*Ideologiekritik*, and by extension the critical theory of ideology, is
not a mere intellectual exercise, but a task that exposes the immanent
contradictions of bourgeois thought for its supersession.

But in raising this point about the nature of criticism, I have
inevitably stumbled across the question of *methodology*. After all, if
the mere academic exercise of exposing illusions does not suffice for a
critical theory of ideology, what other steps are necessary? As we have
seen, Mannheim's conception of social determination is too abstract and
imprecise to function as a starting point. To that end, the following
section explains the methodological principles which the Frankfurt
School uses in its quest.

### Non-Autonomy of Thought from Activity

Recall that one problem with Mannheim's conception of ideology is that
it is too vague and therefore allows the reader to insert their
preferred theory of ideology into the account. To avoid this pitfall,
one must use a different method than Mannheim's, lest it fall prey to
the very same indeterminate metaphysical entities one should do away
with. Hence, as a matter of method, one must stress the *non-autonomy of
thought* from activity. The oft-quoted Marxist claim that "legal
relations as well as the forms of state \[\...\] have their roots in the
material conditions of life"<d-footnote>Karl Marx, "Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 1978), 4.</d-footnote> extends to the origin of ideology as
well. This does not imply that such material relations are *a priori*
concrete and immediately accessible to the investigator. Such material
conditions are only uncovered *after* engaging in dialectical
investigation. To fail to conduct such an investigation leaves the
putative material relations overly abstract and insufficiently
determinate. Marx's methodological criticism of the classical political
economy is relevant:

> "It seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete, with
> the real precondition, thus to begin, in economics, with e.g. the
> population, which is the foundation and the subject of the entire
> social act of production. However, on closer examination this proves
> false. The population is an abstraction if I leave out, for example,
> the classes of which it is composed. These classes in turn are an
> empty phrase if I am not familiar with the elements on which they
> rest. E.g. wage labour, capital, etc. These latter in turn presuppose
> exchange, division of labour, prices, etc. For example, capital is
> nothing without wage labour, without value, money, price etc. Thus, if
> I were to begin with the population, this would be a chaotic
> conception \[*Vorstellung*\] of the whole, and I would then, by means
> of further determination, move analytically towards ever more simple
> concepts \[*Begriff*\], from the imagined concrete towards ever
> thinner abstractions until I had arrived at the simplest
> determinations. From there the journey would have to be retraced until
> I had finally arrived at the population again, but this time not as
> the chaotic conception of a whole, but as a rich totality of many
> determinations and relations."<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Grundrisse* (London: Penguin Classics, 1993), 100.</d-footnote>

Moving from the concrete to the abstract uncovers the abstract relations
which govern the (previously empty, formalistic) concreta, but these
abstract relations in turn can only attain validity *on the basis of an
investigation of definite material social relations*. Consequently:

> "The concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many
> determinations, hence unity of the diverse. It appears in the process
> of thinking, therefore, as a process of concentration, as a result,
> not as a point of departure, even though it is the point of departure
> in reality and hence also the point of departure for observation
> *Anschauung* and conception."<d-footnote>Ibid., 101.</d-footnote>

Within the abstracta that one uncovers via this process is the seed of
the social relations which give it its validity. For instance, "the
simplest economic category, say e.g. exchange value, presupposes
population, moreover a population producing in specific relations; as
well as a certain kind of family, or commune, or state, etc. It can
never exist other than as an abstract, one-sided relation within an
already given, concrete, living whole."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote>

One therefore returns to the concrete, but this time as a set of
concrete relations which are the *result* of dialectical investigation
and not dogmatically assumed. These concrete facts are *social* in
nature, as the asocial conception of a human essence is one which treats
sensuous activity as if it were mere contemplation.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: Norton & Co., Inc., 1978), 145, §VI.</d-footnote>

Another advantage of Marx's dialectical method is that it not only
avoids the problems of the overly abstract and indeterminate methodology
of Mannheim, but also the overly specific and asocial methodology which
ostensibly lies in contraposition to it. Bukharin notes that nearly
every economic figure associated with the Marginal Revolution argues for
the subjective theory of value using examples of isolated atomic
individuals and then presuming that such examples scale up to a social
level.<d-footnote>Nikolai Bukharin, *Economic Theory of the Leisure Class* (New York: International Publisher, 1927), 42.</d-footnote> This Hobbesian model, on which the functioning of the whole
is wholly reducible to the functioning of the constituent parts is
unjustified because man is a *zoon politikon* and not Robinson Crusoe,
and consequently a society is more than a mere aggregation of Robinson
Crusoes. The economic effects of the inherent sociality of humanity are
that the picture of society that positivists like the Marginal
Economists depict is not only incorrect, but *precisely* *backward*, as
Bukharin argues:

> Society (as is consciously or unconsciously assumed) is not an
> arithmetical aggregate of isolated individuals; on the contrary, *the
> economic activity of each specific individual pre-supposes a definite
> social environment in which the social relation of the individual
> economies finds its expression* \[emphasis mine\]. The motives of the
> individual living in isolation are entirely different from those of
> the "social animal" (*zoon politikon*). The former lives in an
> environment consisting of nature, of things in their pristine
> simplicity; the latter is surrounded not only by "matter" but also by
> a peculiar social milieu. The transition from the isolated human to
> society is possible only by way of the social milieu. And indeed, if
> we were dealing only with an aggregate of individual economies,
> without any points of contact between them, \[...\] there would be no
> society. Of course, it is theoretically quite possible to embrace a
> number of isolated and remote economies in a single conception, to
> force them into a "totality" as it were. *But this totality or
> aggregate would not be a society* \[emphasis mine\], a system of
> economies closely connected with each other with constant interaction
> between them. While the former aggregate would be one we had
> artificially constructed, the second is one that is truly present.
> Therefore the individual economic subject may be regarded only as a
> member of a social economic system, not as an isolated atom.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote>

Individualistic models of social science à la Hobbes and Böhm-Bawerk
therefore create a false totality that does injustice to *both* the
particular *and* the general. But the excursus on the Marginal
Revolution shows us a second problem with extant attempts to unite
social sciences under the banner of philosophy: namely, that different
social sciences embrace mutually exclusive philosophical assumptions and
methodologies.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 8.</d-footnote> That the assumptions and methodologies are useful
within a specific field does not take away from the fact that these
assumptions seem impossible to reconcile into a totality. For example,
while mainstream economics embraces an individualistic methodology that
privileges the particular individual over social processes as a whole,
the opposite problem occurs in some branches of sociology which rely on
ideal types of groups of individuals that do not cleanly correspond to
flesh and blood individuals.<d-footnote>Recall that this is one problem with Mannheim's sociology of knowledge.</d-footnote> For instance, one finds in Émile
Durkheim's seminal work on suicide a methodology that proceeds *from*
the general *to* the particular: a methodology totally repugnant to the
individualistic methodology of economics. Differences in the types of
suicides are fleshed out in terms of their causes, i.e., the "social
conditions responsible for them."<d-footnote>Émile Durkheim, *Suicide*, trans. John A. Spaulding and George Simpson (London: Routledge Classics, 2002), 99.</d-footnote> Specific instances of suicide
correspond with more or less fidelity *to* the ideal types, since the
object of analysis is the "*social* suicide-rate \[emphasis
mine\]."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Thus, contra the method of economics<d-footnote>As well as the tendency toward isolated thought experiments in analytic philosophy, though such a method only blossomed well after the period of time under consideration in this essay.</d-footnote> "\[t\]he social
rate must be taken directly as the object of analysis; progress must be
from the whole to the parts."<d-footnote>Ibid., 100.</d-footnote>

A methodology like that of Marx, one which searches for the material
social relations which lie immanent in the abstracta of a given
ideology, is necessary for a critical theory of ideology. By
investigating the dialectic between ideology and material relations, we
also solve the problem of the disconnect between ideology as such and
its bearers in Mannheim's sociology of knowledge, that is, a gap between
"the mundane struggles of everyday historical life, and *next to them
also* the conflicts of the 'systems of *Weltanschauungen*.' "<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept of Ideology?," 145.</d-footnote>
Without the dialectical critique of ideology in material social
relations, the whole concept of situational determination becomes
metaphysically strange and lacking in any explanatory power.

Moreover, while Mannheim's attempt to give a value-free conception of
ideology has a scientific veneer, his eschewing of the normative side of
ideology requires a strict fact/value distinction which itself is
unscientific. This division is a common problem to scientific inquiry of
the time, especially of positivism. As Horkheimer notes in "Notes on
Science and the Crisis," scientific inquiry does not stand outside the
"dynamisms of history,"<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis," in Critical Theory: Selected Essays, trans. Matthew J. O'Connell and others (New York: Continuum Publishing Co., 2002), 3.</d-footnote> and thus the cleavage between "theory and
action is itself a historical process."<d-footnote>Ibid., 4.</d-footnote> Scientific inquiry,
including the Mannheimian sociology of knowledge, is in the grasp of two
contradictions:

> "First, science accepts as a principle that its every step has a
> critical basis, yet \[...\] the setting of tasks, lacks a theoretical
> grounding and seems to be taken arbitrarily. Second, science has to do
> with a knowledge of comprehensive relationships; yet, it has no
> realistic grasp of that comprehensive relationship upon which its own
> existence and the direction of its work depend, namely, society."<d-footnote>Ibid., 7.</d-footnote>

Underlying both these problems is the need for science to be directed by
"the necessities of social life,"<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> viz., the necessities of
*capitalist* social life, which takes as a presupposition the division
of labor. Returning to Mannheim, we see that the insistence that the
sociology of knowledge stands *above* specific total conceptions of
ideology imbues it with a false totality insofar as it does not ground
the predominance of these ideologies in social relations. On this point,
it is unsurprising that there is a degree of affinity between Mannheim
and the Neo-Kantians of the Marburg School, both of whom insist that
"everything about the object is reduced to conceptual determinations,
\[and hence\] the end-result of such theoretical work is that nothing is
to be regarded as material and stable."<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Traditional and Critical Theory" from *Critical Theory: Selected Essays,* trans. Matthew J. O'Connell and others (New York: Continuum Publishing Co., 2002), 198.</d-footnote> We have, then, a totality,
but a false and empty one.

One material relation that undergirds this intellectual fragmentation is
the division of labor in capitalist societies. Here, Lukacs' work on
reified consciousness presaged later critiques of scientific inquiry by
the Frankfurt School. The mere fact that there are psychological
implications of commodity fetishism is obvious. After all, it involves
misperceiving the social relations of labor as "an objective character
stamped upon the product of that labor"<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Capital* (Hertfordshire: Wordsworth Editions Limited, 2013), 47.</d-footnote> while the objects
*themselves* appear in the social relations of the value-form. The
results of such a process is that objectivity and subjectivity get
inverted; the world of commodities, as Lukacs notes, "confront \[man\]
as invisible forces that generate their own power"<d-footnote>Georg Lukacs, *History and Class Consciousness*, trans. Rodney Livingstone (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1971), 87.</d-footnote> while
*subjectively* "a man's activity becomes estranged from himself, it
turns into a commodity which \[...\] must go its own way independently
of man just like any consumer article."<d-footnote>Ibid. Also note that *HCC* was published *before* the publication of the 1844 Manuscripts!</d-footnote> *Pace* concerns about
conflating the Taylorist and Fordist mode of capitalist production of
the early 20^th^ century with contemporary, putatively "post-Fordist"
production, one may still identify the throughline of rationalization
and specialization: viz., the breaking down of the productive process
"into abstract, rational, \[specialized\] operations so that the worker
loses contact with the finished product and his work is reduced to the
mechanical repetition of a \[specialized\] set of actions."<d-footnote>Ibid., 88.</d-footnote> This
implies a second process: that of converting labor time "from a merely
empirical average figure to an objectively calculable work-stint that
confronts the worker as a fixed and established reality."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> The
psychological consequence of this process is that even the worker's
"psychological attributes are separated from his total personality and
placed in opposition to it so as to facilitate their integration into
specialised \[sic\] rational systems and their reduction to
statistically viable concepts."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote>

Why assume intellectual labor is any different? The mere fact that there
*is* an intellectual division of labor is mundane, but leads to profound
consequences. The intellectual division of labor leads to an isolation
of specialized fields from one another, which in turn limit their
utility and scholarly output. Buck-passing on matters of fact leads some
disciplines (especially in the social sciences) to uncritically accept
the object of their investigation, weakening the overall scientific
value of the endeavor. But this uncritical acceptance *also* distorts
the goals of scientific inquiry. For Horkheimer,

> "A conception \[of theory\] is needed which overcomes the
> one-sidedness that necessarily arises when limited intellectual
> processes are detached from their matrix in the total activity of
> society. In the idea of theory which the scholar inevitably reaches
> when working purely within his own discipline, the relation between
> fact and conceptual ordering of fact offers a point of departure for
> such a corrective conception. The prevailing theory of knowledge has,
> of course, recognized the problem which this relation raises. The
> point is constantly stressed that identical objects provide for one
> discipline problems to be resolved only in some distant future, while
> in another discipline they are accepted as simple facts."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Traditional and Critical Theory," 199.</d-footnote>

Hence, what makes something ideological is not *just* a question of the
researcher uncritically accepting the object of analysis (thought that
is *part* of the formulation). Rather, ideology *also* required that the
aims of investigation also determined by entities other than the
researchers themselves. The researcher is not a Kantian agent who can
set their own hypothetical ends, but rather a part of a capitalist
process who must subordinate these ends. This subordination may be
*immediate*, in the case where one subordinates the ends of research to
one's boss or research and development board, or *mediately* via
attempts to reify one's consciousness (as occurs when one chases
academic trends rather than pursue one's self-selected goals).Both the
input *and* the output of intellectual research are determined in
scientific inquiry. Social totality determines *both* the object of
analysis and the researcher as subject, both of which determine the
aims. Social totality *needs* to be taken into account. I shall
henceforth refer to the two ways in which social totality determines
intellectual activity (that is, it both determines the object of
analysis, which the researcher must uncritically accept, and the *telos*
toward which the activity aims) as *double determination*.

One of two consequences follow from this intellectual division of labor.
Either scholars must content themselves with the role that the division
of labor provides for them, in which case many questions worth
investigating are left unanswered,<d-footnote>See, *inter alia*, Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc., 2014), 6.53, p. 107-8.</d-footnote> or one must engage in blind
speculation beyond the limits of one's discipline. Consequently, we see
in both "Traditional and Critical Theory" as well as "Notes on Science
and the Crisis" that the intellectual division of labor is the
ultimately determining grounds for limitations in thought. To return to
Mannheim, then, we see another error in the sociology of knowledge:
viz., that it proceeds *from* the particular *to* the total conception
of ideology. While, for Mannheim, the total conception of ideology flows
*from* the development of the particular concept of ideology, Lukacs
shows us that the individual *psychological* characteristics which
constitute a particular conception of ideology are the *result* of, in
the final analysis, the capitalist division of labor, while Horkheimer
shows that this analysis *also* applies to reified academic pursuits.
This leads, in turn, for social scientists to fall prey to double
determination, and requires the imposition of strange metaphysical
entities to do the explanatory work. We now have a basic methodological
schematic for investigating ideology. What remains is to uncover *how*
things are determined via ideology.

### Functionalism

The *Ideologietheorie* of the Frankfurt School finds its most fleshed
out form when investigating the self-conception of the so-called "early
modern" thinkers who represented the nascent bourgeoisie contra decadent
feudalism. This is because thinkers like Machiavelli and Hobbes were the
first to broach the subject of ideology, that is, the question of "how
the social situation relates to the prevailing ideas that come to be
recognized as false."<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History" in *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 361.</d-footnote> Yet the approach that especially the latter
undertook rendered such an investigation fruitless for two reasons, per
Horkheimer. First, for liberal theorists, the term "ideology" merely
refers to the inverse of Reason.<d-footnote>Ibid., 361.</d-footnote> This juxtaposition is itself
historical, as "the material and intellectual development of the
preceding periods as a necessary prerequisite for the
Enlightenment."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Were Enlightenment able to self-reflect on its own
temporal ascendence, the rigidity of the distinction would vanish. This
is a point that even the mature Horkheimer and Adorno stress in
*Dialectic of Enlightenment*; viz., that despite Enlightenment's
pretense of liberating humanity from the "self-incurred immaturity"<d-footnote>Immanuel Kant, \"An Answer to the Question: What Is Enlightenment?\" in *Toward a Perpetual Peace and Other Writings on Politics, Peace, and History*, (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2006), 17, 8:35.</d-footnote>
of myth, it was incapable of grasping that Enlightenment "entangles
itself \[...\] in mythology."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, *Dialectic of Enlightenment,* trans. Edmund Jephcott (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2002), 8.</d-footnote> Second, the methodological
individualism of thinkers like Hobbes, who conceive of the state as
explicable "in terms of the properties of its smallest constitutive
parts, namely human beings,"<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History," 339.</d-footnote> prevent the theory from having any
explanatory power in the realm of social science. Here, Mannheim's
situational determination *at least* has the advantage of having the
*pretense* of sociality built into the model.

For Horkheimer, ideology is not merely an individual falsehood, but has
a "specific function in social struggle."<d-footnote>Ibid., 314.</d-footnote> It is therefore a
*functionalist* concept rather than a mere metaphysical entity or
moral-political judgment about the pathological nature of action or
thought. While emphasizing the primacy of the social may lead to worries
about how such social entities are grounded, unlike Mannheim, Horkheimer
recognizes that the social nature of ideology is explicable in terms of
the sensuous material activity that societies engage in:

> The predominant ideas of an epoch have roots that go deeper than the
> ill intentions of certain individuals. Such ideas are endemic to a
> given social structure, whose outlines are given by the way in which
> individuals sustain themselves at the time. The basic process whereby
> primitive hunters or fishermen secure their existence dictates not
> only their material mode of life, but in a certain sense their
> intellectual horizon as well. Similarly, the form of life based upon
> this primitive level of development not only conditions the actual
> life of the individuals, but also has a significant influence on their
> knowledge of the external world, as well as on the content and
> structure of their general understanding of life. The same point
> applies to more differentiated forms of society: *the intellectual
> life of individuals is bound up with the life process of the social
> body of which they are a part and which determines their activity*
> \[emphasis mine\].<d-footnote>Ibid., 360.</d-footnote>

Ideology, then, is *not* a precondition for agency or group formation,
but rather the *result of a material social process*. However, it is a
result which subsequently serves as a presupposition of the social
process in a dialectical manner. To conflate ideology, i.e., a *result*
of the process of social activity, with the activity itself, is to make
a category error. There is a whiff of more traditional Marxism in this
account:

> it is impossible to understand the content or nature of peoples
> intellectual makeup without knowledge of the epoch in which they live,
> or indeed (leaving the primitive peoples aside) without knowing the
> specific position they occupy in the social production process. The
> vital functions necessary to sustain and further human existence have
> not been combined within every single individual since the time of the
> primitive hunters and fisherman; rather, such functions are
> distributed amongst the various groups within society. But this also
> entails the differentiation of the whole of thought \[*geistige
> Leben*\], which develops internal contradictions.<d-footnote>Ibid., 361.</d-footnote>

More orthodox strands of Marxism would mostly concur that one cannot
understand one's intellectual makeup without understanding their
position in class relations. However, this is a *weaker* claim than the
Vulgar Marxist conception of *strict* reflection theory. This weakening
of the Vulgar Marxist view allows Horkheimer's view to escape historical
relativism, as "\[t\]he relativity of a proposition and ideology are two
rather different sorts of things. The limits to what may be \[sic\]
rightly be called ideology are constantly set by our current state of
knowledge."<d-footnote>Ibid., 362.</d-footnote> Ideological falsehood is not falsehood simpliciter, but
a specific type of falsehood defined on the basis of function.

Given that the Frankfurt School thinks that ideology is the result of a
social process, one might rightly ask *what* function gives rise to
ideology. Here, the notion of ideology as *false* and *obfuscatory*
comes to the fore. In "Notes on Science and the Crisis," Horkheimer
sketches out the way in which earnest attempts to ascertain the truth
may still count as ideological insofar as they obfuscate the true nature
of society:

> Not only metaphysics but the science it criticizes is ideological, in
> so far as the latter retains a form which hinders it in discovering
> the real causes of the crisis. To say it is ideological is not to say
> that its practitioners are not concerned with pure truth. Every human
> way of acting which hides the true nature of society, built as it is
> on contrarieties, is ideological, and the claim that philosophical,
> moral, and religious acts of faith, scientific theories, legal maxims,
> and cultural institutions have this function is not an attack on the
> character of those who originate them but only states the objective
> role such realities play in society. Views valid in themselves and
> theoretical and aesthetic works of undeniably high quality can in
> certain circumstances operate ideologically, while many illusions, on
> the contrary, are not a form of ideology. The occurrence of ideology
> in the members of a society necessarily depends on their place in
> economic life; only when relationships have so far developed and
> conflicts of interest have reached such an intensity that even the
> average eye can penetrate beyond appearances to what is really going
> on, does a conscious ideological apparatus in the full sense usually
> make its appearance. As an existing society is increasingly endangered
> by its internal tensions, the energies spent in maintaining an
> ideology grow greater and finally the weapons are readied for
> supporting it with violence.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis" from *Critical Theory*, 7-8.</d-footnote>

That ideology obfuscates the immanent contradictions in society does not
entail that one may simply dispel ideological illusions via shining a
light upon it. Contra later Critical Theorists who insist on ideal
discursive conditions, ideology is not *merely* illusion, and hence no
number of exhortations to the truth can suffice to remove it.<d-footnote>I'm thinking predominantly of Habermas here. For an evisceration of Habermas' theory of communicative action, see Raymond Geuss, "A Republic of Discussion: Habermas at ninety," *The Point*, 18 June 2019, <https://thepointmag.com/politics/a-republic-of-discussion-habermas-at-ninety/></d-footnote>

Ideologies may function well in their role, but like other machines, can
break down and cease to function. When ideologies break down, not all
its adherents jump ship. Rather, when the ideological superstructure and
its requisite institutions falter or no longer can no longer play their
role in the reproduction of society, those who benefit from the
prevailing social order remove the mask of liberal humanitarian
reasoning to reveal the hideously fiendish face of brutality beneath it.
Or, as Horkheimer notes in *Dawn and Decline*, "\[t\]he less stable
necessary ideologies are, the more cruel the methods by which they are
protected."<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Dawn" from *Dawn & Decline*, 17.</d-footnote> The rise of fascism in the 30s, and the ever-growing
threat of an eerily similar authoritarian capitalism today, show that
the Enlightenment flickers as it falls prey to its own mythos, leaving
behind only ash and soot, a testament to its spent potential. The
revelation that the myth of Enlightenment was not an eternally valid
truth, but a construction which displaced earlier myths, causes monopoly
capital to put less weight on it and more weight on repression, just as
someone who injures their right leg places more weight on their
left.<d-footnote>Such a distinction presages Althusser's distinction between the Repressive State Apparatus and Ideological State Apparatuses by over a generation. See Louis Althusser, *On Ideology* (London: Verso Books, 2020), 15-22.</d-footnote>

If ideology is functional, *where* is this functionalism? The answer is
that it lies in human action and thought. To that end, the following
section lays out the *obfuscatory* function that ideology plays in
hiding the immanent contradictions of bourgeois society.

### An Adjectival, Not a Nominal Account of Ideology

As we have seen, the concept of ideology is *not* an abstract
metaphysical entity like a *Weltanschauung*, but a *functionalist
process*. Rather than stipulate ideology as abstracta à la Mannheim, the
Frankfurt School treats ideology as *adjectival*. That is, to paraphrase
Herr Morain, for the Frankfurt School, ideology is false consciousness,
with an emphasis on *false* and not on *consciousness*. That ideology is
conceived of as falsehood is not unique to the Frankfurt School,
obviously, but what separates the IfS is its recognition that there is a
moment of truth in ideology and in all thought. This subsection traces
the causal chain that gives rise to ideological distortions, starting
from its most abstract components toward a more determinate answer based
in the capitalist mode of production itself.

The aforementioned paragraph from "Notes on Science and the Crisis"
shows that ideology is not bullshit in Harry Frankfurt's sense: that is,
speech which is unconcerned with the truth whatsoever.<d-footnote>See Harry G. Frankfurt, *On Bullshit* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005), 47-62.</d-footnote> This is a
point at which Horkheimer and Mannheim are in agreement. Both think that
ideology is neither actively deceitful nor unconcerned with the truth.
This point is worth mentioning since careless theories of ideology often
reduce the concept to either bullshit or deception. Rather, for
Horkheimer, many well-intentioned intellectual programs become
ideological because they unintentionally obscure the immanent
contradictions within society. Intellectual programs of this type
abound, many of which fall prey to double determination. Indeed, this is
a recurrent problem with positivism of all stripes.

But why does science in the capitalist epoch tend toward ideological
obfuscation? If ideology is neither bullshit nor malicious falsehood,
then one may rule out the Vulgar allegedly-Marxist theory that it is
merely a matter of bourgeois self-interest to deceive the masses.
Theories that rely on conspiratorial deception are themselves
non-Marxist, as they attribute agency to the putative Great Men of
History instead of the masses engaged in antagonistic economic social
relations. Rather, focusing on why this paragraph on ideology appears in
"Notes on Science and the Crisis" is elucidatory. The rest of the essay
contains a theme that returns in the opening chapter of *Dialectic of
Enlightenment*: the instrumentalization of reason. Speaking of
scientific inquiry before 1914, Horkheimer notes that the Enlightenment
program of bourgeois criticism against Scholasticism had fulfilled its
task by the mid-19^th^ century.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis," 5.</d-footnote> The resultant endeavor was thus the
description and classification of phenomena that did not concern itself
with distinguishing the relevant from trivial. After overcoming
Scholasticism, Enlightenment scientific inquiry ceased criticism, and
therefore dogmatically assumed that its premises were eternal and
unchanging. It thus went from being a liberating force to a conservative
one, which maintains extant social relations. Consequently, the
mechanistic view of science that predominated was more attuned to
maintaining society as it was rather than advancing it. This led
scientific inquiry to eschew questions about social progress, which in
turn forced it to rely on "a set of unexplicated, rigid, and fetishistic
concepts"<d-footnote>Ibid., 6.</d-footnote> rather than attending to the real "need \[...\] to throw
light on them by relating them to the dynamic movement of events."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote>

The root of this failure is not science itself but the social conditions
which relegate it to a bureaucratic role in the day-to-day management of
capital instead of rational inquiry. Scientific inquiry is in the grasp
of two contradictions, as Horkheimer explains:

> First, science accepts as a principle that its every step has a

These two contradictions are related, since both stem from a lack of
investigating society. More critically, these contradictions arise
*because* the economic order on which scientific inquiry depends is
itself enmeshed in immanent contradictions. The reification of human
activity encompasses not only the factory floor, but also the ivory
tower. The division of intellectual labor has incentivized the
renunciation of totality. Moreover, the *aims* of science are not its
own, as science "is determined in the scope and direction of its work
not by its own tendencies alone but \[...\] by the necessities of social
life as well."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> That is, capital conducts science as part of its
process, and the rise of what Adorno and Horkheimer call the
"administered world" shows that monopoly capital's intimate relationship
with the state plays an important role. Since the state and capital play
a predominant role in the scientific crisis, "that crisis is inseparable
from the general crisis."<d-footnote>Ibid., 9.</d-footnote> Scientific inquiry that is subject to
the double determination is, by that fact, ideological. But this
division of academic labor is one that must be imposed upon the
scientist. The forces that impose limitations on scientific inquiry have
their root not in the realm of thought but in capitalist social
relations. Hence, to uncover the false element in ideology we must
abandon the idyllic pretensions of intellectual clarity and descend into
"the hidden abode of production."<d-footnote>Marx, *Capital*, 119.</d-footnote>

The growth of this thought is ideological insofar as it papers over the
immanent contradictions within economic activity and the legal form. Yet
this is not a function of malevolent actors suppressing the truth, but
rather the result of Enlightenment's ambiguous relationship with
capital. The Enlightenment's aim of liberating humanity from its
superstitions may have extirpated existing myths, but in so doing it
marshaled up myths of its own: those of rationalization, formalization,
and regulation.<d-footnote>Horkheimer and Adorno, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, 3.</d-footnote> All that reason cannot subjugate underfoot must be
committed to the flames; it is for this reason that "Enlightenment is
totalitarian."<d-footnote>Ibid., 4.</d-footnote> Alongside this standardization comes the principle
of *equivalence*: bourgeois society "makes dissimilar things comparable
by reducing them to abstract quantities."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> But the very moment of
rationality's domination over nature is empty. Rather than standing
alongside it, man is subjected to the very Enlightenment myths which he
conjured up. The unified schematic of earlier philosophical epochs
proves less useful to capital than its fragmentation into sundry
specialized sciences, all of which avoid the critical steps of
justifying their tasks or relating them to an overall whole. In short,
since the real subsumption of labor to capital is the true cause of the
false and obscuring elements of ideology, one at last finds that one's
thought is not autonomous.

If ideology is fundamentally false, then what is conversely true? Here,
the concept of *totality* as the opposite of ideology is important to
stress.

### Ideology and Totality

The concept of ideology must be counterposed to that of totality. Since
ideology both obfuscates immanent contradictions in a social totality
and plays a role in class struggle, totality must strip away the
illusory element of ideology. But how might one go about doing this?
Here, two facets of the Frankfurt School tradition provide us with the
tools to overcome the overgrowth of ideology that papers over the real
foundation of capitalist social relations: that of *interdisciplinarity*
in the critical theory of ideology and doing *justice to the
particular*. Immediately upon his ascension to the directorship of the
IfS, Horkheimer stressed the need for interdisciplinary investigation to
address the crisis of scientific knowledge. In his inaugural address in
this capacity, Horkheimer attempted to lay out the lacunae in extant
attempts at uniting disparate phenomena under the label of totality.

Social philosophy, the discipline with which Horkheimer identified
himself, requires viewing people not as autonomous, atomic individual
subjects (as bourgeois philosophy since at least the time of Hobbes has
done), but rather as "members of a community"<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," in *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 1.</d-footnote> and consequently
attempts to understand "phenomena that can only be understood in the
context of human social life: \[...\] with the entire material and
intellectual culture of humanity."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Even though the withering of
German Idealism spelled the dissolution of classical social philosophy,
one must still look to Hegel to see how the cunning of spirit makes
particular ends universal.<d-footnote>Ibid. Though of course, Hegel's argument in the *Lectures on the Philosophy of History* is bourgeois in the sense that it relies on the Smithian division of labor as a universal constant rather than a development of the capitalist mode of production.</d-footnote> While the empirical researcher must
delve into the slaughter-bench of history, Hegel thought philosophy
raises us to the standpoint of the owl of Minerva, providing consolation
and reconciling injustices with the development of reason. The
transfiguration of reality which occurs in this practice also reconciles
the particular to the universal, so that one cannot fully actualize
oneself in the context of a state, though the state exists as an end in
itself.<d-footnote>Ibid., 5.</d-footnote> As the prestige of German Idealism decayed during the
latter half of the 19th century, the metaphysics of objective spirit was
replaced with a naive optimism in the pre-established harmony of
individual interests and a Whig history. But this worldview proved
empty, and individuals increasingly viewed the world as a medley of
arbitrariness. The claim that individuals partake in the organic unity
of the State, which, *qua* ethical community, is itself a part of the
dialectic of history. When it went by the wayside, people saw brute
facts as naked, requiring a theory to use. Even the neo-Kantians got in
on the action in the late 19^th^ to early 20^th^ centuries via their
attempt to show that there existed some higher realm outside the scope
of positivism.<d-footnote>Ibid., 6. One may cite Hermann Cohen in the sphere of philosophy, Hans Kelsen in the legal sphere, and Mannheim in the sociological field as exemplars of this neo-Kantian approach.</d-footnote>

These social philosophies are right to articulate a supra-individual
sphere, but also have shortcomings: they are still too positivistic and
individualistic.<d-footnote>Ibid., 7.</d-footnote> Their insistence on this methodology forces them
to rely on metaphysical abstracta (e.g., the Hegelian *Volksgeist* or
the various false assumptions that economists have always made) that
render the theory unable to explain distinctively *social* phenomena.
One further complication is that there are often mutually exclusive
methodologies *within a given scientific domain*. As Marx notes, what
separates classical political economy from its Physiocratic predecessors
is in part a methodological difference: while the Physiocrats focused on
a concrete example of labor (viz., agricultural labor), Smith's advance
consists in throwing out "every limiting specification of
wealth-creating activity"<d-footnote>Marx, *Grundrisse*, 104.</d-footnote> to the abstract universality of labor as
such. To repeat a theme from Section 3.3, *only* a dialectical approach
of the kind that Marx outlines in the *Grundrisse* can overcome the
antinomy between the overly reductive individualistic approach of early
bourgeois philosophy and the overly abstract and indeterminate approach
of Mannheim and Durkheim.

The crisis of the social sciences has its origin in the division of
labor that makes the social sciences possible in the first place. In
particular, the strict bifurcation of empirical social research and
social philosophy renders both worse off than uniting the two via a
dialectical continuum. The heart of this dialectical relation is one of
interdisciplinarity: "the task is to \[...\] pursue \[...\] larger
philosophical questions on the basis of the most precise scientific
methods, to revise and refine their questions in the course of their
substantive work, and to develop new methods without losing sight of the
larger context."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 9-10.</d-footnote> Philosophy must give empirical work its animating
impulses but also must be left open to be changed by its results. Thus,
there is a need to gather disparate fields together in collaboration to
pursue the questions in this dialectical fashion. Philosophical
questions get integrated into scientific study; the results of such
studies advance philosophical knowledge. Hence, this is a social
process: a fitting one, given the social nature of the object of
analysis.

There is one remaining problem. Recall that Mannheim's account of
ideology is lacking because it is so broad that it does not do justice
to the particular, as it involves placing competing worldviews in a
titanic struggle over and above the political struggles that flesh and
blood people undertake. Despite our best efforts, one may worry that the
comprehensive critical theory of ideology sketched out here is still
inadequate in this respect. The idea of totality is counterposed to
ideology: totality is truth and ideology is false. Hence, we need some
concept of totality to explain *why* ideology is false consciousness.
This task has become more pressing given the increasing broadsides
against the concept of totality in the decades since the decline of the
original generation of the Frankfurt School.<d-footnote>See, e.g., Jean-François Lyotard, *The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge*, trans. Geoff Bennington and Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984).</d-footnote> Though the influence
of postmodernism on the academy has waned, the initial suspicion of a
unity which crushes underfoot the possibility of the creation of new
game rules remains.

Of course, critiques of totality are not new. These criticisms have
been, historically, the domain of the Right and levied against *liberal*
insistence on the sovereignty of reason.<d-footnote>See, *inter alia*, Joseph de Maistre, "On Divine Influence in Political Constitutions" from *Considerations on France*, ed. Richard A. Lebrun (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2006), 49-53.</d-footnote> But if we allow ourselves
to dispense of the concept of totality, the critical theory of ideology
becomes pallid and intellectually barren, as there is no universal
metric by which one may measure the content of ideologies, as the world
becomes a "medley of arbitrariness."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 3.</d-footnote> If this is the case, then
there is no reason to prefer a critical theory of ideology over a
Mannheimian sociology of knowledge, as both will be founded upon
unstable metaphysical foundations. Without the ability to unify social
scientific inquiry under one banner, we risk falling prey to those
objections which state that there is simply too much knowledge for any
intellectual enterprise to account for.<d-footnote>See, e.g., F. A. Hayek, "The Use of Knowledge in Society," *The American Economic Review* 35, no. 4 (Sep. 1945): 519-530.</d-footnote> On the other hand, to
dogmatically assume the objective possibility of totality is to commit a
grave philosophical sin, as it presumes the very conclusion it aims to
establish.<d-footnote>Indeed, this is why introductions in philosophy are unphilosophical, as philosophy should progressively unfold the immanent intellectual content that lies latent inside the object of inquiry. Georg Wilhelm Fredrich Hegel, *The Phenomenology of Spirit*, ed. Terry Pinkard and Michael Baur (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 3.</d-footnote> One must subject one's own intellectual tools to
criticism before using them.

The solution to this problem first appears in the Young Marx's writings,
which stress that criticism which contented itself with criticism of
ideas was insufficient as it did not apply this analysis to concreta.
This does not imply that we know material relations *a priori*, as
Marx's hitherto mentioned analysis of the method of political economy
shows. To give putatively concrete entities more determinate content
requires us to put concreta in the context of *social* relations,
thereby giving material conditions a totality. It is for *this* reason
that Marx considered all previous versions of materialism deficient; by
foregoing the social and practical elements of material relations, one
treats materialism as a mere object of contemplation.<d-footnote>See Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, 143.</d-footnote>

It is for this reason that the IfS' insistence on both a theoretical and
empirical element to their research as well as a collaborative work
ethic allowed it to prosper, if only for a moment. The image of the
bourgeois intellectual, isolated and productive, is one which is
ill-suited to the task of remedying the faults with scholarly inquiry
today. Its reified nature suits those with niche interests, but the
academy's self-perception as an outdated relic has some merit today. The
ceaseless exhortation for academics to justify themselves belies an
insecurity that they can no longer serve either capital or knowledge. In
attempting to serve both masters, the modern academy has served neither.

By contrast, Horkheimer saw fit to stress that totality is the way *out*
of the intellectual crisis of our age. The crisis *arose* in the first
place because disparate fields assume contradictory but useful
assumptions which seem impossible to reconcile into a totality.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 7.</d-footnote>
But not every grouping of intellectuals is up to the task. Indeed, the
common criticism that the IfS set too lofty a goal for any group of
intellectuals to accomplish would be a valid criticism if the aim of the
group were merely to interpret the world. While this may make good
material for academic self-aggrandizement, it is no way to change the
world. The Institute failed not because its goal was unrealistic but
precisely because the institute did not embrace its interdisciplinary
and partisan nature *enough*. Interdisciplinarity can only grasp the
totality once it entails not only a shared research program between
intellectuals of different stripes, but *also* a shared commitment to
some form of praxis. Contra later generations of critical theorists,
critical theory must not be an exercise in retreating into abstraction
to satiate Rawlsian hunger, as it then becomes meaningless abstracta.
Rather it must be a theoretical tool which can be placed in the only
group which can overcome the total reification of all life both inside
and outside the academy: the international proletariat.

At this point, the reader may wish for a concrete example of what a
critical theory of ideology *looks* like, and how it is connected to the
concept of totality. Luckily, Horkheimer provides us with one when
analyzing the bourgeois revolutionary in his sprawling essay "Egoism and
Freedom Movements."

### Theory and Critique of the Bourgeois Revolutionary

To fully appreciate the interwoven nature of the Frankfurtian
*Ideologiekritik* and *Ideologietheorie* we must recognize that the
predominant object of analysis that Horkheimer examined during the 1930s
was bourgeois philosophy. Being a good historical materialist, he traces
its development during the ascent of the Third Estate from the 16^th^ to
18^th^ centuries in "Egoism and Freedom Movements." In said essay,
Horkheimer's *theory* that philosophy in the Early Modern period
responds to and develops out of the rising power of the (as of yet still
subordinated) bourgeoisie is intertwined with a *critique* of said
philosophy as obfuscatory. This obfuscation arises not due to
malevolence, but is an inversion of the *real* premises on which
capitalism operates.

At first glance, one may think that the substantive disagreements
between thinkers in this period prevents a systematic analysis of
philosophical thought therein. Every student of political philosophy
knows that writers never tire of contrasting Hobbes the pessimist with
Rousseau the optimist, of those whose view of human nature as selfish
and reprobate drives them to conservatism with those whose view of human
nature as virtuous and uncorrupted drives them to liberalism or
anarchism.<d-footnote>See, e.g., the final chapter of Carl Schmitt, *Political Theology* (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2005). While Schmitt's contrast is with counterrevolutionary thinkers like de Maistre and anarchists like Bakunin, and not with liberal thinkers like Hobbes and Rousseau, it is a useful read insofar as it plays on the same distinction.</d-footnote> Even before Hobbes' time, Horkheimer sees Machiavelli
and More as *dramatis personae* with the roles of realist and
pedagogical optimist respectively.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements: On the Anthropology of the Bourgeois Era" from *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 49.</d-footnote> Both camps have their
respective thinkers. Even Machiavelli finds a rival in his native Italy
with Tommaso Campanella's *Civitas Solis*, which emphasizes the capacity
for a utopian society where reason reigns and discards all envy,
property, and cause for discord.<d-footnote>Tommaso Campanella, *La città del sole* (Milano: Adelphi eBooks, 2023). <https://archive.org/details/lacittadelsole0117camp></d-footnote>

Yet despite this apparent antinomy, there are points of unification
between the two camps. The first is a rejection of the Aristotelian
conception of value that governed previous forms of political thought in
the West in favor of a view of human nature that appealed to
"historical, political, and psychological analysis."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 50.</d-footnote> In so doing,
both camps attempt to maintain a pretense of neutrality: a pretense that
does not bear much fruit. As a type of science, political theory in this
period needed an object of analysis: in this instance the isolated
individual. This "unquestioned individualistic principle that regulated
the relationships of owners to one another, \[and\] also \[...\] the
mental and instinctive barriers caused by the combination of this
principle with the \[...\] increasing differentiation of social
classes"<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> rendered theory in this period uncritical and dogmatic.
By reducing political questions to mere questions of how Robinson
Crusoes would interact, political philosophy of this type becomes
ideological insofar as it papered over the differences internal to
social life by reducing members of the society to interchangeable
abstracta. While a Mannheimian ascription of ideal types to the two
camps seems promising, one of the key differences between the
Machiavellians and Moreans is one of power: those who emphasize "the
aggressive \[...\] drives of human beings indicated an interest in
oppression, whereas the emphasis placed on educability \[...\] was an
expression of emancipatory tendencies."<d-footnote>Ibid., 51.</d-footnote>

One further commonality between the camps is the condemnation of egoism
and pleasure. Examples of this abound: from not only Machiavelli's
repeated insistence that a corrupt city can only stay free with great
difficulty,<d-footnote>Niccolò Machiavelli, *Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio* (Milano: BUR Rizzoli, 2018), I.XVII-I.XVIII, p. 108-111.</d-footnote> but also Luther's insistence that man's free will can
lead him away from God,<d-footnote>See Martin Luther, *Bondage of the Will*, trans. Henry Cole (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House Company, 1976), 122-7.</d-footnote> the Calvinist doctrine of total depravity,
to the laws of Campanella's City of the Sun, which treat women's makeup
and heels as capital offenses.<d-footnote>Campanella, *La città del sole*, 32. «Però è pena della vita imbellettarsi la faccia, o portar pianelle, o vesti con le code per coprir i piedi di legno; ma non averiano commodità manco di far questo, perché chi ci li daria?»</d-footnote> This distrust of egoistic behavior
continues up through the victory of the Third Estate; Robespierre
contrasts personal egoism to egoism which melds personal regard for love
of the nation.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 53-4.</d-footnote> This undergirds his personal disgust toward
corruption, which reaches its extreme during the trial of Danton.

Yet at the same time as this development of bourgeois morality,
bourgeois political economy also develops. The pre-capitalist
prohibition on usury<d-footnote>St. Thomas Aquinas, "Question 78. Usury" from *Summa Theologiae*, vol. 38 (Westminster: Blackfriars, 1975), 233-254.</d-footnote> collapses from Calvin's criticism,<d-footnote>I do not wish to overstate this point. Despite a *de jure* prohibition on usury, money lending did occur in Catholicism (e.g., the Church borrowing from the Fuggers). Additionally, Calvin is not as laissez-faire about money lending as is commonly assumed: he merely wishes to allow for money lending in *some* cases. This view is therefore less radical as it may seem, especially given the historical context. See David H. Eaton, "The Economists of the Reformation: An Overview of Reformation Teaching Concerning Work, Wealth, and Interest," *Sage Open* 3, no. 3 (July 1, 2013): <https://doi.org/10.1177/2158244013494864>.</d-footnote> and
the rise of merchant capital gave the urban bourgeoisie an economic and
political power that it had not yet seen. At first glance, it seems
strange that a moral aversion to egoism develops at the same time as a
general slackening of economic regulations that bound the bourgeoisie.
After all, the economic aims of the individual members of the
bourgeoisie are selfish at heart. What Horkheimer saw, however, is that
it is *precisely* the rise of capitalism that gave rise to this ethical
doctrine. The unleashing of capitalistic economic relations required
restraints to keep it from running amok: this was a point that most of
its advocates ceded.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 54.</d-footnote> While purely juridical and traditional
restraints may have sufficed in the odd exception (e.g., Horkheimer
cites 19^th^ century Britain, and perhaps one may add the U.S. of the
same period), in most instances the state was necessary to guide
capital. But morality qua social force (one should keep in mind that
"ethics" and "morality" ultimately stem etymologically from words
meaning "custom") also helped restrain the beast. Hence, Horkheimer is
correct to note that "the moralistic view of man contains a rational
principle, albeit in mystified, idealistic form."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> If, as Marx and
Engels note, "\[t\]he religious world is but the reflex of the real
world,"<d-footnote>Marx, *Capital*, 53.</d-footnote> then one must add that it does not always mirror the real
world, but in this instance inverts its form of appearance. The role of
anti-egoistic morality in capitalist society, then, is *both* one side
of an antinomy immanent to the social totality, *and* a belief system
which obfuscates the *real* terms on which social reproduction occurs.

That such a doctrine became popular as the bourgeoisie gained its
footing *expresses* bourgeois social power; were there no ascendent
capitalist relations, there would be no need to hammer home the critique
of egoism ad nauseam. The proof of this is the inconsistency with which
the espousers of this moral schema apply it to different social groups.
While many of these moralists inveigh against luxury, many are reluctant
to fully trust the poor. This is most prominent with Luther, whose
thunderous polemic against the Peasants' Revolt reaches almost comical
proportions.<d-footnote>Martin Luther, "Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants" from *Luther's Works*, vol. 46, 55 vols. (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1967), 45-57.</d-footnote> Even Robespierre, radical though he was, is far from
cordial toward the Énragés.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 103.</d-footnote> Moreover, this distrust expresses
itself as a tolerance for egotistical striving for power--in *some*
social classes. Luther's supplication of the nobility, Machiavelli's
appraisal of Cesare Borgia, and the Jeffersonian aggrandizement of the
yeoman farmer all share the willingness to overlook "the striving of the
mighty for power, prosperity within sight of misery, \[and\] the
maintenance of anachronistic and unjust forms of society."<d-footnote>Ibid., 55</d-footnote>

This antinomy between the economic demand for competition, and therefore
self-interest, on one hand, and the moral demand to eschew
self-interested behavior has psychological effects on the bourgeois
subject. The moral demand requires that one forgo lower pleasures for
the sake of higher ones, and one is supposed to take pleasure in
putatively uniquely *human* virtues.<d-footnote>Ibid., 57.</d-footnote> This requires that one also
make peace with the world as it is: "\[n\]othing makes a person more
suspect than the lack of an inner harmony with life as it happens to
be."<d-footnote>Ibid., 58.</d-footnote> All that is seen as frivolous is degraded as bestial. At the
same time, the very frugality which this morality promotes is used as a
means toward capital accumulation. This antinomy only becomes more
outwardly expressed as capital claws its way to a position of economic
dominance. For instance, Adam Smith's valorization of thrift as the
route to primitive accumulation attempts to merge the ethical and
economic drives.<d-footnote>Adam Smith, *An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*, (Petersfield: Harriman House, 2007), 214-6.</d-footnote> Yet despite all the thrift and ambition of the
poor man's son, he finds in his old age that all his wealth was mere
vanity.<d-footnote>Adam Smith,T*he Theory of Moral Sentiments*, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 211-2.</d-footnote>

This brief overview of the schematic of bourgeois revolutionary thought
shows that Horkheimer's account of ideology is at once both a detailed
theory (which places thought in the context of the social conditions
which give rise to it) *and* a *critique* of ideology (insofar as the
moral system is obfuscating an immanent contradiction in bourgeois
society).

## Conclusion

### Loose Threads and Further Avenues for Research

There are a few loose threads that provide opportunities for further
research beyond the scope of this essay. One may object that in the
course of the investigation into ideology, I have remained too abstract
insofar as I insufficiently investigated the material basis on which the
ideological superstructure arises. In plain terms, one may argue that
the critical theory of ideology is a project which aims at describing
and unmasking the elements of the superstructure, but is insufficiently
attentive to the matters of the economic base. One avenue for further
research, then, is the application of the Frankfurt School's critical
theory of ideology to the economic relations that form the real basis of
society.

Of course, when talking about the real foundations of society, one must
give a good account of how the real foundation of economic relations
gives rise to the superstructure. One would find oneself in good company
if one were to look to legal relations as a sort of bridge between the
two, insofar as legal relations not only specify the conditions under
which economic relations may be carried out, but also tie these
relations to other spheres of life. Here, one should note that already
by the time that Horkheimer ascended to his position as head of the IfS,
Marxists of various backgrounds had criticized positivism for its
uncritical approach to science. Evgeny Pashukanis rightly noted that
legal positivism commits this sin when treating the legal form and its
corresponding categories as eternal, unchanging essences instead of
ideological categories that spring forth from the development of
capitalism.<d-footnote>Evgeni B. Pashukanis, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism* (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2003), 73-85.</d-footnote> The legal form requires definite antinomies (e.g., the
competing interests of different claimants) to function, as were there a
unity of purpose among differing elements of a group, there would be no
recourse to legal arbitration. Law, Pashukanis notes, mirrors the
development of generalized commodity exchange, insofar as both are
expedients "resorted to by isolated social elements in their intercourse
with one another."<d-footnote>Ibid., 134.</d-footnote> While Pashukanis is not optimistic about the
ability to do away with this expedient entirely at present, the extent
to which arbitration is resolved via the judiciary is historically
contingent; previous modes of production relied more heavily on other
means of social regulation (e.g., religious doctrine, ad hoc
vigilantism). Further investigation into the legal form and its
mediating role between base and superstructure, however, is a task for
another day. The IfS were not primarily a group of attorneys, and hence
a detailed analysis of how the legal form itself functions on
ideological presuppositions (e.g., the antagonistic model of trial) is
beyond the scope of the project.

A good Marxist would rightly note that not just the legal form, but also
the political economy on which it is based, has an ideological character
thanks to its inability to criticize the premises which serve as
foundational in its science. The net result is that said sciences lapse
back into dogmatism and paper over the real fissures within bourgeois
society with a false unity. Classical political economy, with its
Smithian insistence in a transhistorical "certain propensity in human
nature \[...\] to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for
another"<d-footnote>Smith, *The Wealth of Nations*, 9</d-footnote> leads its adherents down a primrose path to an
explanatory dead end when accounting for the origins of capitalism. The
Smithian explanation of the origins of capital accumulation are quite
individualistic.<d-footnote>Though not *entirely* individualistic, as Smith notes that landlords, for instance, have structural incentives to not engage in capitalistic economic relations.</d-footnote> For Smith, capital accumulates gradually in those
who are frugal, while it fails to accumulate in spendthrifts.<d-footnote>Ibid., 216.</d-footnote> Even
the poor worker may, if frugal enough, eventually may "maintain a menial
servant"<d-footnote>Ibid., 214.</d-footnote> \[though who would the frugal menial servant employ?\] or
he may waste it on vice. Even the putative extravagance of the rich man
is explained as extravagance in maintaining his opulent servants<d-footnote>Ibid., 216.</d-footnote>
\[but would a truly frugal man not cut costs by doing their work
himself?\] rather than prodigality on behalf of the rich man. In so
doing it reduces differences between rich and poor nations to a matter
of a difference in *Volksgeister* and differences between classes as a
predominantly *temperamental* difference rather than a difference in the
means by which one labors. Of course, this is inverted: temperaments are
not the cause of class differences, class differences incentivize
differences in temperaments.

Of course, any economist who would sully himself by deigning to read
this essay (and therefore reading outside his own hallowed field) would
rightly protest that Smith is outdated and that not all economics uses
abductive reasoning of this type. Indeed, given the more quantitative
nature of economics today and the indebtedness the field owes to the
Marginal Revolution, Smith's work is not even the same *type* of
academic endeavor as that of the modern economists. Fair enough. But
this does not mean that economists escape the problem of double
determination. The model of *homo economicus* as a rational,
self-interested agent underlies most microeconomic theories, but is
itself an assumed fiction of dubious validity. Already by the turn of
the 20^th^ century, bourgeois economists had criticized the view.
Thorstein Veblen's famous dismissal of the (now heterodox) Austrian
School points out that not only is the view of human nature used
oversimplified, but so removed from common sense views of human agency
as to be useless:

Stylistic prose aside, Veblen's essay is instructive as it is an example
of how economic models lose their explanatory power when one dares
criticize its undergirding assumptions. Not only the concept of *homo
economicus* but the desire-satisfaction or hedonistic theories of the
good that much of microeconomics assumes is philosophically suspect. The
former falls prey to an obvious Euthyphro problem while the latter fell
out of favor after criticism from Robert Nozick,<d-footnote>Robert Nozick, *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (New York, Basic Books, 1974), 43-5.</d-footnote> hardly a bastion
of the left!

Despite its dubious philosophical origins, economic concepts reign
supreme in areas even beyond its intended use. The rise of Law and
Economics as an academic field stands out as one such area thanks to its
increasingly predominant role in legal reasoning over the past several
decades. The work of Richard Posner often involves porting over economic
concepts to the law, and in so doing, porting over the uncritical
abstractions of the field into real social relations. While a
substantive critique of modern economic thought would be a fruitful
endeavor, one should keep in mind that the neoclassical turn occurred
decades after the collapse of the IfS, and hence a dialectical criticism
of the movement is beyond the scope of the paper.

### Concluding Remarks

I conclude by remarking on the theoretical virtues of the Frankfurtian
account of ideology. Too often in contemporary theories of ideology, one
sees that the author has forsaken a definite methodology, instead
treating the concepts *ad hoc*. This consequently weakens the
*Ideologietheorie* as the theory has no determining grounds on which it
can stand. Of course, this in turn prevents the *critical* aspect of
ideology critique from reaching its full force, as there is no method by
which one can adjudicate the falsity of the object of investigation.

On these matters, the Frankfurt School's conception of ideology stands
as a shining beacon which rises above the detritus of the tomes
published after it. The IfS' insistence on not accepting the given
without subjecting it to critique, on the inability of bourgeois thought
to adequately self-criticize, and by reiterating time and again that "it
is not enough merely to correlate \[\...\] ideas with some social group
\[\...\] \[w\]e must penetrate deeper and develop them out of the
decisive historical process from which the social groups themselves are
to be explained,"<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Social Function of Philosophy" from *Critical Theory*, 263.</d-footnote> the Frankfurt School stands head and shoulders
above the unsystematic buffoons who came after them.
