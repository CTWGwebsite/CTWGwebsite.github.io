## Blog Submission Guidelines

*Introduction* :
The Critical Theory Working Group is proud to welcome unsolicited submissions for our blog. Feel free to submit works dealing with Critical Theory, Marxism, socialism, and/or communism, broadly construed. Please mind the following guidelines when submitting:

*Formal requirements* :

* Original submissions should be a single finished text (not a pitch) with a maximum length of around 3000 words (not counting bibliography).
* Submissions need not be traditional essays; we accept aphorisms, ‘theses,’ dialogues, and similar non-traditional genres of theoretical writing.
* Submissions should be accompanied by a short summary or abstract of a few sentences (ca. 200 words).
* US-American spelling and grammar is preferred, but not required.
* Submissions should use the Chicago Manual of Style with endnotes (bibliography optional)  
* Author/translator bios are optional. Pen names are allowed. 
* Submissions should be in MS Office docx format.
* Right now, we are accepting translations from German, French, Italian, and Arabic. Please provide a scan or transcription of the untranslated text and a short summary when submitting.

*Relevance requirements* :

* The writing must have *theoretical* content. We are not interested in *feuilletonnage*, opinion pieces, musings on current events, or glorified diary entries. If you make claims, you must back them up. If you reference something, you must properly cite it. We expect a reasonable degree of seriousness and rigor.
* Critical theory, Marxism, socialism, communism, and everything in between is fair game, but our main focus is still Critical Theory, especially Early Critical Theory. This does not mean that pieces must engage with Critical Theory *narrowly* defined as the work of the Frankfurt School, but merely that it must engage with critical theory and/or Marxism, *broadly* defined.

*Further information* :

* We reserve the right to refuse to publish submissions, especially those that don’t meet our standards of quality and/or relevance.
* As our blog and journal is published under a Creative Commons license, others are free to republish, translate, *détourner*, and *umfunktionieren* our texts however they please—although we politely request that they provide credit and link back to our site when doing so.
* Please allow 2-3 weeks for the editorial board to get back to you with a decision.  
* Please only submit one proposal at a time.
* Submissions should be sent via email to crittheoryworkgroup \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com
