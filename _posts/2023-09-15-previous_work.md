### Preliminary Sessions (Hosted by James/Crane) (Spring-Fall 2023)

**Self-Criticism and Historical Materialism (Early Fall 2023):**
Returning to Lukacs ([“The Changing Function of Historical Materialism”](https://monoskop.org/images/3/3b/Lukacs_Georg_History_and_Class_Consciousness_Studies_in_Marxist_Dialectics.pdf) (1919); [“What is Orthodox Marxism?”](https://monoskop.org/images/3/3b/Lukacs_Georg_History_and_Class_Consciousness_Studies_in_Marxist_Dialectics.pdf) (1919); [“Moses Hess and the Problems of Idealist Dialectics”](https://files.libcom.org/files/georg-lukacc81cs-tactics-and-ethics-political-essays-1919-1929a.compressed.pdf) (1926)) and Korsch ([“Marxism and Philosophy”](https://ia801906.us.archive.org/2/items/karl-korsch-marxism-and-philosophy-marxismus-und-philosophie-marxismo-e-filosofi/Karl%20Korsch%2C%20Marxism%20and%20Philosophy%2C%20Marxismus%20und%20Philosophie%2C%20Marxismo%20e%20filosofia%2C%20Massimo%20Morigi%2C%20Repubblicanesimo%20Geopolitico%2C%20marxismo%20occidentale.pdf) (1923); “Introduction to the Critique of the Gotha Program” (1922); “The Marxism of the First International” (1924)) for three weeks, focusing on how each argues – by reference to the concepts of totality and the unity of theory and practice – that Marxism is self-critical or it is nothing. We conclude with two weeks discussing the heterodox historical materialisms of Ernst Bloch ([The Spirit of Utopia](https://archive.org/details/TheSpiritOfUtopiaErnstBloch) (1923): “Karl Marx, Death, and the Apocalypse”) and Walter Benjamin ([“Author as Producer”](https://monoskop.org/images/9/93/Benjamin_Walter_1934_1999_The_Author_as_Producer.pdf) (1934); [“Eduard Fuchs: Collector and Historian”](https://files.libcom.org/files/Eduard%20Fuchs,%20Collector%20and%20Historian%20-%20W.%20Benjamin%201937_0.pdf) (1937)).

**Horkheimer’s Early (pre-40s) Historical Criticism (Late Summer 2023)**
Focusing on Horkheimer’s work in the 1930’s: “The Present Situation” (1931), “Traditional and Critical Theory” (1937) and its “Postscript” (1937) ([collected here](https://monoskop.org/images/7/74/Horkheimer_Max_Critical_Theory_Selected_Essays_2002.pdf), in Critical Theory), Marcuse’s reply “Philosophy and Critical Theory” (1937) ([collected here](https://monoskop.org/images/7/74/Horkheimer_Max_Critical_Theory_Selected_Essays_2002.pdf), in Negations), and Horkheimer’s later reflection [“The Social Function of Philosophy”](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/horkheimer/1939/social-function.htm) (1939) (also collected in Critical Theory, link above). Our focus was on defining the concept of critical theory that Horkheimer develops in his writings in the 30’s – namely, Horkheimer’s argument that critical theory must be an extension of Marx’s critique of political economy into a comprehensive social theory. Rather than providing just another scientific paradigm for the explanation of social history, critical theory begins as a theory of the failure of modern social theories (whether speculative-metaphysical or empirical-scientific) to provide such a comprehensive social theory. (This is only Horkheimer’s point of departure. The core of his 30’s concept of critical theory is a careful combination of historical criticism and materialist logic.)

**Method and Science (1919-1931) in Marxian Social Criticism (Early Spring 2023).**
Focusing on Lukacs’ [“What is Orthodox Marxism?”](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/1919/orthomarx.html#:~:text=In%20Marxism%2C%20orthodoxy%20refers%20solely,the%20tradition%20of%20its%20founders.) (1919), Korsch’s [Marxism and Philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/korsch/1923/marxism-philosophy.htm) (1923), and Horkheimer’s [“The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research”](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/horkheimer/1931/present-situation.htm) (1931). Our focus was on the theoretical practice of early, Marxian critical theory – the problem of Marxist ‘method’ after the critique of methodological formalism (Lukacs), the problem of ‘vulgar’ Marxism that pretends to the status of non-partisan social science (Korsch), and the interpenetration of social philosophy and empirical social science required by any critical theory of capitalist society (Horkheimer).
