I've never read an account of the socio-historical determination of
philosophy that fully satisfied me. There always seems to be some level
of mediation missing, some level of distortion or sleight of hand at
play in the explanatory framework. This problem really crystallized for
me when I read and presented on Marcuse's essay "The Concept of Essence"
with the Critical Theory Working Group last fall. The way it subsumed
the history of philosophy under its gaze thrilled me at the same time as
it set off alarm bells in the back of my mind. Its attack on the
ahistorical pretensions of philosophy appealed to the historical
materialist in me and its systematic account of Marxism as a theory of
essence appealed to the philosopher in me. At the same time, I had a
nagging sense that something was amiss on both counts, and I couldn't
really see how it all fit together. As I continued to engage with it, I
began to suspect that the specter of totalization, which had been part
of the essay's initial appeal, covered over a number of confusions and
deficiencies that prevented it from fulfilling the promises that I had
originally read into it. These promises are of 1) a historical
materialist account of the origins and development of the concept of
essence that grounds both in the social conditions from which they arose
and 2) a marxist theory of essence that facilitates the project of
revolutionary praxis in the present day. I still believe that attempting
to fulfill these promises is a worthwhile project, although one that
(perhaps predictably) cannot be completed within the bounds of a single
essay. With that in mind, I will focus here on laying the groundwork for
that larger project, using Marcuse's essay as a jumping-off point for
developing my own historical materialist account of the emergence of a
recognizable concept of essence in Ancient Greece.<d-footnote>I do not mean to claim that this emergence represented the absolute origins of the concept of essence in a world historical sense, but rather to take it as an example of the emergence of that concept from out of a milieu in which it had previously been absent (and one that appears to have been foundational for the tradition we refer to as Western or European philosophy).</d-footnote>

In Part 1, I will begin with a critical examination of Marcuse's account
of the historical development of essence and the reasons for its failure
to realize what it set out to achieve. I will argue that the most
important of these reasons involve a formalist interpretive apparatus
and the subsumption of the historical materialist elements in his work
under an idealist philosophy of history, which lead him to neglect the
concrete socio-historical conditions under which the concept of essence
emerged in Ancient Greece. After that I will address the work of Alfred
Sohn-Rethel, which bears some superficial similarities to the
investigation undertaken here, but shares many of the problems that
plagued Marcuse's account, and use the discussion of his work as an
opportunity to further distinguish my project from both of theirs.

In Part 2, I will begin my reconstruction of the social determination of
the emergence of the concept of essence in Ancient Greece, starting with
the pre-history of the concept of essence. This will involve 1) an
examination of what I will call the bardic conception of truth and its
situation within an earlier mode of production centered around the
warrior-aristocracy depicted in the Homeric epics 2) an account of how
the reciprocal dynamic of commercialization and the centralization of
slavery within the mode of exploitation, along with changes in the
practice of warfare, created a crisis of the traditional warrior
aristocracy and the mode of production centered on them, which set the
stage for the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in
Pre-Socratic Monism (PSM) and 3) a concluding examination of the works
Theognis of Megara and the transitional conception of truth developed in
them, which bears marks of both the bardic conception that preceded it
and the concept of essence that followed it.

In Part 3, I will turn to PSM itself and its relation to the changes
described in the preceding section. First, I will offer an examination
and critique of Richard Seaford's account of the origins of PSM and its
relation to the money form as a result of what he calls "unconscious
cosmological projection." Then, I will elucidate my own positive account
of the origins and development of PSM in terms of its ideological
function in response to the aristocratic and social crises of the
Archaic period and the inability of its proponents to recognize the
latent content of the money form as an externalization of the total
social labor that posits both the equality of labor and its
thoroughgoing interdependence.

Finally, in Part 4 I will discuss the methodological, historical and
practical implications of the preceding reconstruction, with an eye to
the larger project set out in this introduction.

There are also two appendices attached to this essay, the first of which
details the methodological background that underlies the arguments
presented in the body of the essay, and the second of which provides a
more concrete reconstruction of the relevant historical developments
that took place between the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces and the
consolidation of the _poleis_ in the Archaic. The second in particular
is important for putting the developments discussed in Part 2 in their
proper perspective and justifying a number of the claims made there.

## 1. The Problem of Historical Reconstruction

### Marcuse's Position (1.1)

My beginning this piece with an examination of Marcuse's essay "The
Concept of Essence" is in some sense a nod to the biographical origins
of the investigation I am undertaking here. It was his essay that sent
me down the path that culminated in the writing of the essay you are
reading now. So, if you'll allow me to be a little loose with my terms,
beginning in this way can be seen as an attempt to leave somewhat ajar
the doors of the hidden abode of production whose product stands before
you in the form of a finished work; Or, in a more Hegelian vein, to lay
bare the process of mediation without which the result would appear as a
bare immediacy stripped of its full meaning and conceptual content. To
properly elucidate the concepts developed here, the conceptual and
methodological problems in Marcuse's essay that served as their origin
must themselves be taken back up into their exposition, and so I must
begin with an account of Marcuse's position. At the same time, it should
be understood that the primary purpose of this essay is not the
evaluation of that position, but rather the development of an account of
the emergence of the concept of essence and its socio-historical
determination, which, despite inheriting its object and certain
animating problems from Marcuse's account, rests on different
principles, principles that could be said to represent the determinate
negation of those that Marcuse's essay is founded on. In this sense,
Marcuse's position is only a starting point, but it is nevertheless an
essential starting point.

At first glance, Marcuse's essay has the appearance of offering a
historical materialist account of the emergence and development of the
concept of essence (and to some extent it does do so, as we'll see
below). It is framed as an attempt to show how "even \[the\] loftiest
conceptions of philosophy are subject to historical development," and
how "so much of men's real struggles and desires went into the
metaphysical quest for an ultimate unity, truth, and universality of
Being that they could not have failed to find expression in the derived
forms of the philosophical tradition."<d-footnote>Herbert Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," in _Negations: Essays in Critical Theory_, trans. Jeremy Shapiro (Mayfly Books, 2009), 31.</d-footnote> This suggests that the
project Marcuse is pursuing is an attempt to demonstrate the validity of
the basic historical materialist postulate that "it is not the
consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social
existence that determines their consciousness."<d-footnote>Karl Marx, _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_, trans. S.W. Ryazanskaya (Progress Publishers, 1977), Preface.</d-footnote> But, upon closer
examination, this framing already reveals the deficiencies of his
project from the perspective of a genuine, dialectical conception of
historical materialism.

The first way in which it does so is by restricting the scope of the
socio-historical determination of thought. In order to account for the
apparent invariance of the _content_ of the concept of essence, which he
glosses as "the abstraction and isolation of the one true Being from the
constantly changing multiplicity of appearances," Marcuse argues that it
is the "_position and function_ \[of such concepts\] within
philosophical systems" \[italics mine\] that is subject to change.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 31.</d-footnote>
It is therefore to the position and function of the concept of essence
that we should look to understand its socio-historical determination.
But, this division between an invariant content and a historically
determined position and function already concedes too much to the
idealist position Marcuse is trying to argue against, abstracting and
isolating the content of the concept from the realm of historical
explanation and positing it as an eternal, transcendent content whose
origins are either obscure or unknowable.

The obscurity of the origins of this transcendent content creates a
number of problems for the beginning of Marcuse's historical account.
Without the ability to give a historical explanation of the origins of
the content of the concept of essence, he is forced to posit its
emergence as an external bringing-together of independently pre-existing
determinations (or of the philosophical problems that underlie
them).<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 32.</d-footnote> He argues that it is the bringing-together of the
"epistemological" determinations of unity, universality and abstraction
with the determination of truth---understood as distinguishing between
hierarchically ordered levels of reality---that provides essence with
its "critical and ethical elements" and so with its primary function
within Plato's philosophy, which is to establish a "critical gap"
between what is and what could or should be.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33. As we shall see in Part 2, there is a notion of truth that pre-exists the emergence of the concept of essence, but it is not until that emergence occurs that it takes on the determination Marcuse attributes to it.</d-footnote> He doesn't explain
where these determinations, or the problems that form their
"philosophical substratum," themselves arise from, or why they are
brought together to form the concept of essence, outside of some
quasi-mystical and ultimately tautological talk of a "quest for the
unity and universality of Being in view of the multiplicity and
changeability of beings."<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 32--3.</d-footnote> It is as if, for Marcuse, the Ancient
Greeks already had a notion of essence preconceived in their heads
before they went searching for it.

If there _is_ an invariance in certain elements of the concept of
essence, or of any other metaphysical category---which does have a
certain plausibility given a cursory look at the history of
philosophy---then that invariance must itself be understood
historically. First, it must be established (which it isn't clear to me
has been done, whether by Marcuse or anyone else), and then it must be
traced to its roots in the socio-historical conditions of the various
periods in which it can be observed, whether this means finding some
common condition, or set of conditions, that explain its persistence, or
providing an explanation of how a set of relatively contingent
circumstances led to its maintenance under different modes of production
despite lacking such a common basis.<d-footnote>I will suggest a few possibilities on this score below, such as that it is existence of social presuppositions of the process of production that underlies a certain continuity in the determination of truth, and the monetization of these presuppositions that does the same with continuities in the determination of essence, but these are provisional hypotheses derived from the concrete historical material, and requiring confirmation from further historical investigation, rather than theoretical or methodological assumptions brought to that material on the basis of high-level generalization.</d-footnote> Not only that, but the question
of what exactly is invariant in that concept, if anything is, must
remain open throughout the investigation. Whether it is actually the
determinations of unity, universality, abstraction, and truth that form
the invariant content of the concept of essence, or even whether it is
in terms of content that the concept is invariant, are questions whose
answers, like those to the question of invariance itself, cannot be
assumed from the start but must be found, tested, modified, and retested
in the material itself as the process of investigation proceeds.

Additionally, this obscurity about origins begins to give us a sense of
why there is no historical account of the social conditions of Classical
Athens in Marcuse's essay, despite his claim that that is where the
concept of essence first emerged. The ahistorical nature of the content
allows it to appear as a pure origination, one that seems to have been
completely contingent and in no need of explanation. Still, even the
supposedly ahistorical nature of the content does not fully explain the
complete lack of socio-historical grounding that we are discussing. For
example, one would expect the position and function of the Platonic
concept of essence to still be subject to such grounding given Marcuse's
framing, but this is conspicuously absent from his exposition.

The reason for this has to do with the deeper set of deficiencies
revealed by Marcuse's framing, which themselves have to do with the
overall interpretive apparatus of the essay, which is over-reliant on
"expressive causality" or homology and ultimately subsumes its
historical materialist elements under an idealist philosophy of
history.<d-footnote>For an overview of the Althusserian critique of expressive causality and the subsumption of it under the critique of homology, see Fredric Jameson, _The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act,_ (Cornell University Press, 1981), 23--43. For the general conception of allegory and interpretive levels on which this analysis is based, see Jameson, _The Political Unconscious,_ 29--32.</d-footnote> This appeared in the framing in terms of the _expression_
of real human struggles and desires "in the derived forms of the
philosophical tradition," but its centrality to Marcuse's analysis is
demonstrated much more clearly by taking the interpretive apparatus as a
whole as our object of examination. In this schema, the text of the
history of philosophy is read on multiple levels, each of which can be
categorized according to the primary philosophical methodology that is
operative in it.

We can call the first level quasi-Heideggerian because it is where the
lingering influence of a Heideggerian problematic---recall that Marcuse
was a student of Heidegger---is most prominent. It is also the level on
which the bulk of the interpretation of Plato's concept of essence is
conducted. At this level, Marcuse reads Plato's concept of essence
according to an altered version of the Heideggerean conception of
metaphysics in which the primarily question is of the relationship
between Being and beings, a relationship that is made possible by a
transcendence of the "facticity" of beings.<d-footnote></d-footnote><d-footnote>See Martin Heidegger, "What is Metaphysics?," ed. Dieter Thomä, trans. Ian Moore and Gregory Fried, _Philosophy Today_ 62, no. 3 (2018): 733--51, <https://doi.org/10.5840/philtoday20181024232>, for the conception of metaphysics referenced in this paragraph, especially 739--44. This focus on transcendence also explains the transcendent character of the "common content," which encompasses the key determinations that attach to Being in opposition to beings, and so must be subject to the transcendence that produces this division.</d-footnote> For Marcuse, this
transcendence does not take place on the basis of the "nihilation of the
nothing," but instead on the basis of the "critical consciousness of bad
facticity, of unrealized potentialities."<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33. For the "nihilation of the nothing," see Heidegger, "What is Metaphysics?," 740.</d-footnote> How the badness of
facticity or the awareness of those unrealized potentialities is
established for consciousness is not clarified, but presumably it has
something to do with the seemingly inherent "quest for the ultimate
unity, universality and truth of Being" and the "struggles and desires"
that went into it, which formed a part of the framing discussed above.
This ungrounded connection of Being to "authenticity" or potentiality,
to "what should and can be," provides the interpretive code on the basis
of which the changing function of the concept of essence in the other
historical examples is understood, and on which the connection to the
next two levels is established.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33.</d-footnote>

We can call the second level the historical materialist level because it
operates on the basis of the concept of the mode of production, although
it does so according to an economically determined expressive causality
that might incline us to label it "vulgar" historical materialism. This
is the level at which the socio-historical determination of the concept
of essence is read on the basis of changes to its position and function.
It is this level of interpretation that generates the most interesting
insights in the historical section of the essay, despite the limits of
its expressive mechanism. In each case, changes in the function of the
concept of essence are read first in terms of the division set up on the
first level between bad facticity and potentiality, as embodying,
distorting, displacing or eliminating the "critical gap" between them
that was established in the the case of Plato, and then reread in terms
of the homology between these changes and changes in the configuration
of the forces and relations of production.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 34--7. For example, the positing of an absolute separation and externality between the two sides in the Medieval concept is understood as an expression of the relations of personal domination that characterized the feudal mode of production, and the subjectivization and displacement of the Cartesian concept of essence into the realm of logic and epistemology is understood as an expression of the individualization and (fetishized) subjection of those individuals to the conditions of production characteristic of the capitalist mode of production.</d-footnote> This order of operations
also helps explain the lack of an account of the social determination of
the Platonic concept of essence, which sets the baseline on which this
second level of interpretation relies, and so falls outside of its
purview.

The third level can be labeled the quasi-Hegelian or idealist level
because it operates on the basis of the concept of freedom, building on
the readings of the previous two levels and rereading them in terms of
freedom in order to construct a teleological metanarrative that
resembles the Hegelian philosophy of history in its broad outlines. In
this metanarrative, the "interest of freedom" is seen as the originating
impulse and inner essence of the development of philosophy, and Marxism,
or the "materialist doctrine of essence," represents the culmination of
that development insofar as it takes as its object the actualization of
freedom---which has been made into a _real possibility_ by the social
conditions of the modern era.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 48--9, 56, and 60.</d-footnote> It is on this third level that the
grounding of the connection between true Being and potentiality that was
missing from the perspective of the first level takes place. We can now
see that the "interest of freedom" is what establishes the badness of
facticity and the conscious awareness of unrealized potentiality, and so
makes possible the fundamental metaphysical division between Being and
beings on which Marcuse's interpretation of the concept of essence is
based. It is able to do so because, as the origin and inner essence of
the concept of essence, it is posited as implicitly containing the seeds
of the whole development in-itself by the meta-narrative constructed
through the interpretive apparatus. This determination by the
interpretive apparatus further disincentivizes any investigation of the
origins or socio-historical determination of the Platonic concept of
essence because such investigation might disturb its function as a pure
origin and inner essence of the development as a whole.

It is the idealist philosophy of history constructed by the third level,
and its subsumption of the historical materialist interpretation, based
on the concept of the mode of production, under itself, that forms the
most objectionable part of Marcuse's overall position and causes the
most distortion of both the historical material and the project of
historical explanation itself. At the same time, even without that
subsumption, Marcuse's reliance on homology would have limited his
ability to properly explain the socio-historical emergence and
development of the concept of essence, even according to the
determinations of the "materialist doctrine of essence" that he himself
set out in the latter half of his essay.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 50--64.</d-footnote> In this latter section, he
paints a more adequate picture of the principles of historical
materialism, although they are still colored by their situation within
the idealist and expressive interpretive frameworks of the overall
exposition, and so they must be evaluated on a case by case basis as to
their usefulness for our project.<d-footnote>See Appendix 1 for a discussion of some of the relevant principles.</d-footnote> Similarly the conclusions drawn
must be called into question and reevaluated on the basis of concrete
historical investigation.

To avoid the problems that prevented Marcuse from developing an adequate
account of the socio-historical determination of essence, our
investigation must rest on a thoroughly different methodological
foundation from his---one whose basic impulses arise from the
determinate negation of the abstract transcendence, formalism and
idealist philosophy of history that subsumed and restricted the
historical materialist elements that gave Marcuse's essay its original
appeal. This means starting with the concrete socio-economic conditions
themselves that gave rise to the concept of essence and any antecedents
it may have had, rather than starting from presupposed conceptual
determinations of that concept and interpreting them on the basis of a
teleological metanarrative or philosophy of history.<d-footnote>My research has led me to locate this emergence not with Platonic theory of Forms, but with the substance monism of the early Pre-Socratic philosophers.</d-footnote> At the same
time, it also means understanding those conditions in the context of a
total social process centered around the mode(s) of production of
concrete social formations and its transformation over time, and giving
explanatory priority to the broadly economic elements that provide its
foundation, while also respecting the relative autonomy of its various
structural elements.<d-footnote>For a more detailed exposition of what I mean by the broadly economic and its foundational place in the overall mode of production, see Appendix 1.</d-footnote> Clearly, this remains an interpretive scheme.
It could not be otherwise. But it is one that is not centered on the
_expression_ of the content of one level in the content of another
level, or on the subordination of the whole interpretive apparatus under
the determinative closure of a master code, but rather on the reciprocal
determination of relatively autonomous elements. Finally, it involves an
active and dynamic suspension of the presuppositions we all bring into
historical interpretation in favor of a dialectical surrender to the
object, but one which does not entail avoiding the responsibility of
simultaneously _thinking_ that object.<d-footnote>For more on this process of active surrender to the object, see Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, _Science of Logic,_ ed. and trans. George di Giovanni (Cambridge University Press, 2015), 37 (21.43) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, _Phenomenology of Spirit,_ trans. A.V. Miller (Oxford University Press, 2013), 3.</d-footnote> Taken together, these form
the basic impulses that animate the conception of historical materialism
I develop in this study. A more detailed elaboration of this conception
can be found in Appendix 1, but, as Hegel reminds us, the true
elaboration can only be found in the unfolding of the project as a
whole.<d-footnote>Hegel, _Phenomenology of Spirit,_ 1--4.</d-footnote>

### Sohn-Rethel & Historical Materialism (1.2)

Another prominent Marxist figure who has attempted to address the social
determination of Ancient Greek philosophy is Alfred Sohn-Rethel. In his
book _Manual and Intellectual Labor_ Sohn-Rethel, like Marcuse, attempts
to construct a grand historical narrative that explains the origins of a
central feature of bourgeois thought---this time the epistemological
foundations of "scientific cognition" as a whole and trace it back to
its socio-historical foundations, which he locates in the "exchange
abstraction" and, more generally, in the division between manual and
intellectual labor. Also like Marcuse, Sohn-Rethel does this in order to
say something about the overcoming of capitalism, this time in terms of
the overcoming of said division between manual and intellectual labor,
rather than in terms of the realization of freedom. In examining the
work of Sohn Rethel, we will find that it is plagued by many of the same
problems as Marcuse's attempt. Our old friends formalism, homology,
transcendence and idealism will all rear their heads once again,
although in enough of a different manner as to remain instructive. If
nothing else, this examination will serve to differentiate the
methodological principles at work in this essay and the questions it
attempts to answer from those of a superficially similar, but
fundamentally different project that it might be associated with.

The first point to make about _Manual and Intellectual Labor_ is that
despite its historical materialist dressing, Sohn-Rethel's project is
completely enveloped by the Kantian problematic it takes as its object
of critique. He starts by saying that he accepts Kant's premise that
"the principles of knowledge fundamental to the quantifying sciences
cannot be traced to the physical and sensorial capacity of
experience."<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor: A Critique of Epistemology_, trans. Martin Sohn-\ Rethel (Haymarket Books, 2021), 31.</d-footnote> But, like many before him, he is unsatisfied with the
way Kant grounds this division between the _a priori_ and _a posteriori_
in the transcendental unity of apperception, which is itself presented
as an ungrounded source of "transcendental spontaneity."<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor_, 31--2.</d-footnote> He argues
that the fault in Kant's project lies in his unwillingness to pursue his
inquiry to the point of locating a "historical origin of our logical
ability to construct mathematical hypotheses and the elements
contributing to them."<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 31--2. This reduction of all the content of the Kantian a priori to a mathematical basis most likely rests on a common faulty interpretation of the role of math in Kant's system (one typically derived from a reading of Kant's analytic presentation of the apriority of space as the form of outer intuition in the _Prolegomena_ which ignores the synthetic presentation of the apriority of space in the _Critique_). For a critique of this interpretation see Lisa Shabel, "Kant's 'Argument from Geometry,' " _Journal of the History of Philosophy_ 42, no. 2 (2004): 195--215, <https://doi.org/10.1353/hph.2004.0034>. This reduction is characteristic of Sohn-Rethel's presentation, which almost exclusively focuses on the quantitative and mathematical elements of philosophical and scientific cognition, which allows him to reduce thought, or "abstract intellect", to a form more easily assimilable to the abstract quantitative determinations of the "exchange abstraction."</d-footnote> His project in _Intellectual and Manual
Labor_ is to show that this historical origin lies in the "exchange
abstraction" which becomes "converted into the conceptual structure of
the abstract intellect."<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor_, 57.</d-footnote> In conceiving his project this way,
Sohn-Rethel retains the Kantian conception of scientific
cognition---which is a product of determinate circumstances
corresponding to a specific phase of the capitalist mode of production
(and of the development of science)---and reifies it as the
transcendental structure of "abstract intellect" and scientific thinking
in general. Without going into the details of the many distortions of
Marx's analysis of the commodity form that result from this, I think it
is sufficient here to say that this leads him into a formalism that is
similar to Marcuse's insofar as his appropriation of both Marx and the
historical evidence are always already structured by this
presupposition.<d-footnote>Some telling examples of this are Sohn-Rethel's dismissal of value as having "no thought content of its own, no definable logical substance" and "bearing no inherent reference to labor" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 40--1), his dismissal of the importance of the landed aristocracy and overemphasis on the role of circulation as the primary source of wealth in Archaic and Classical Greece, along with his characterization of this circulatory wealth as "merchants and users capital" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 83 & 85), and his claim that the exchange abstraction is founded on "social postulates" and thus the concepts derived from it are normative and able to assume an independent logical existence separated from "statements of fact" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 56--7). In all of these cases, the evidence drawn upon is distorted in order to strengthen the isomorphism between commodity exchange (and the societies in which it took place) and the Kantian structure of cognition as divided between _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ (and the capitalist relations of production under which it was formulated).</d-footnote>

In addition to the formalism of his ahistorical conception of abstract
intellect, Sohn-Rethel's Kantian problematic also leads him to to
formulate his conception of "the exchange abstraction" and its "laws" or
"formal structure" on the basis of its necessary conditions of
possibility. At first, he attempts to give his derivation of the
structuring concepts of abstract intellect a materialist veneer by
arguing that they derive from the _act_ of exchange in its opposition to
the _act_ of use. But, as Jameson reminds us, historical materialism
"does not assert the primacy of matter so much as it insists on an
ultimate determination by the mode of production," a reminder which
equally applies to activity abstracted from its mode of production as it
does matter.<d-footnote>Jameson, _The Political Unconscious_, 45</d-footnote> It also gradually becomes clear that it is not the act
of exchange itself so much as the "social postulates" or "fictions" that
underlie the "exchange abstraction (such as the postulate that "no
physical change should occur in the commodities" during the act of
exchange) that provide the actual basis on which the concepts are
derived and "converted" into philosophical concepts. These postulates
are conceived as having nothing to do with "statements of fact," but
rather, "are norms which commodity exchange has to obey to be
possible."<d-footnote>For the elements of the exchange abstraction as social postulates and conditions of the possibility of the act of exchange, as well as their fictional character, see Sohn-Rethel, *Intellectual and Manual Labo*r, 56--7 and 45, respectively. He does seem to recognize the incompatibility of this idealist procedure with his purported materialism in places, such as when he tries to reground the postulate of exemption from material change in human action by saying that "changes caused by human beings which infringe this postulate are outlawed by the police authority presiding in the market," but it is unclear who or what this "police authority" is or whether it corresponds to an actual and invariant condition of commodity exchange, and so falls flat.</d-footnote> It should be clear to anyone who has read the first
chapter of _Capital_ that this has nothing to do with the form-analysis
undertaken by Marx there, in which it is the _relationship_ established
between two commodities in the act of exchange---in which one commodity
is posited as the material embodiment of the value of the other
commodity, which is itself thereby posited as having a value independent
of its own material body and qualitative existence---that posits value
as an abstract determination of the commodity, not any social postulates
that function as transcendental conditions of the possibility of that
act.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, _Capital: A Critique of Political Economy_, vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes (Penguin, 1990), 139--54.</d-footnote> Once again, we see that it is the relationship of reciprocal
determination in which elements stand with respect to each other that
forms the basis of historical materialist explanation, rather than
reliance on a transcendent(al) content determined by a necessity that
stems from the presuppositions of the theorist.

Neither does "the physical act of transfer," which Sohn-Rethel puts
forward as the pseudo-materialist base upon which these social
postulates are supposed to operate, play any part in Marx's analysis of
the commodity form.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 23.</d-footnote> It is this pseudo-materialist base that is
critical in enabling the "conversion" of the concepts derived from the
social postulates into concepts of philosophical or scientific cognition
that take nature as their object. Sohn-Rethel argues that it is through
the operation of these postulates in the "physical act of transfer",
that "the negation of the natural and material physicality \[of the act
itself\] constitutes the positive reality of the abstract social
physicality of the exchange process," which thereby constitutes "a kind
of abstract nature."<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 47</d-footnote> It is this combination of the abstraction
derived from the social postulates and the physicality of the act of
exchange that allows the "conversion" into philosophical-scientific
concepts to happen and establishes the validity of these concepts in
their reference to nature.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 58</d-footnote>

It is here that we can finally begin to understand the otherwise strange
and highly idiosyncratic decision to ground the account of real
abstraction in the act of exchange considered as physical transfer and
the social postulates considered as necessary conditions of
possibility---a conception that one would be hard pressed to derive from
the works of Marx taken on their own. It is the typically Kantian
concern with establishing the validity of the non-empirical concepts
involved in mathematical and scientific cognition in relation to
experience that best makes sense of the motivation for this
decision.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel indicates the importance of this concern for his investigation in the sections on "Reification at the Root of the Intellect\" and "Laws of Nature"; Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 60--2*.*</d-footnote> Without it, there would be no reason to "supplement" Marx
in the way Sohn-Rethel does by dividing the process of abstraction
involved in exchange into an _a priori_ portion that involves conditions
of possibility and _a posteriori_ portion that imparts it with its own
(abstract) physicality.

In order to avoid the formalism and dualism that Sohn-Rethel is led into
by his Kantian problematic, in this essay I will be focusing not on the
emergence of some transcendental structure or general mode of thinking
(whether this be conceived in terms of "scientific thought," "abstract
intellect," "philosophy," or "rationality"), but rather on the emergence
of a determinate concept, abstract substance, as it arises in the
determinate circumstances in which it was developed, and insofar as it
represents the first clear formulation of the opposition between being
and an abstract substratum thought to posit it and constitute its
truth---without assuming that this recognizability entails a continuity
in with later formulations of essence in terms of its meaning or
function. This means to bracket off those other questions, not because I
don't think there is anything to them---I suspect that there are
actually multiple relatively independent processes taking place on
different time scales, but do not discount the possibility of a
significant and transformative convergence of some of these processes in
Archaic and Classical Greece that corresponds with the purported object
of the above theories---but because I don't think approaching such a
question in such broad strokes is productive for understanding the
actual historical developments under consideration. It is only by paying
attention to the intricate and particular details of historical
processes, and situating them within the context of the total social
process that they form moments of, and of the determinate mode(s) of
production on the basis of which that process takes place, that these
questions can be answered without running the risk of falling into the
schematic and ahistorical kind of thinking that overtook Sohn-Rethel.
Unlike Sohn-Rethel, I do not think that there is a singular key to
unlocking the mysteries of the social determination of abstract thought,
and so, to sail through the narrow passage between the Scylla of this
kind of reductionism and the Charybdis of losing oneself in the
immensity of the details, broader questions must be sacrificed (at least
temporarily) in order to preserve the seaworthiness of our explanatory
vessel.<d-footnote>This also means bracketing for the moment the question of Greek mathematics and its relation to both earlier mathematical traditions and philosophy, although I do think there is something distinctive about greek math and it does have something to do with the same processes that led to the emergence of Greek philosophy, with which it seems to be intertwined (at least biographically in the lives of the early philosophers). In terms of changes in the form of thought, it seems to me that the most fruitful angle from which to tackle this topic would involve investigating the development of the judgment and the syllogism as conceptual-linguistic forms. I hope to build off of the present study by pursuing both of these lines of inquiry in future pieces.</d-footnote>

## 2. The Pre-History of the Concept of Essence

### Bardic Truth and its Mode of Production (2.1)

As we saw above, in order to understand the emergence of a recognizable
concept of essence in Pre-Socratic Monism, we must situate it within the
total social process that its development constituted a moment of.<d-footnote>For a more extensive discussion of what this means, see Appendix 1</d-footnote>
This means looking back at its conceptual antecedents and the mode of
production in which they were situated before moving on to the changes
in that mode of production that conditioned the emergence of essence in
the thought of the Pre-Socratics, which we will examine in section 2.2.
In this section, I will content myself with a brief summary of the kind
of society that existed in Greece at the earlier pole of this historical
process, in order to then examine the mythico-poetic system of
representation that corresponded to it. It was in this social and
representational context that one of the primary determinations of
essence identified by Marcuse, truth (_alētheia_), had been situated
before changes in the mode of production led to its re-configuration
into the form it would take in the concept of essence developed by the
Pre-Socratic Monists.

In the Homeric poems, we can see both poles of this process of
development---despite the archaizing perspective of the bardic author.
For now, our focus must be on the earlier pole, which was characterized
by a mode of production in which commodity production and exchange were
relatively marginal and slavery had not yet taken on the central place
in the mode of exploitation that it would in the later period.<d-footnote>See Appendix 2, 260-266 for a more extensive discussion of the role of slavery in the two periods and a critique of Finley's conflation of them in _The World of Odysseus._</d-footnote> In
the communities of this period, the class structure of society was
instead centered on external appropriation of the surplus of other
communities through warfare and raiding and the internal appropriation
of surplus in the form of tribute on the basis of the role that
warrior-aristocrats played in the necessary communal labors of religion
and self-defense.<d-footnote>See Appendix 2, 253-260 for a more in depth look at the different elements of the mode of exploitation in these communities.</d-footnote> The most important point here is that within the
community the mode of surplus appropriation was still, to some extent,
based on the social role of the warrior aristocracy in the necessary
surplus labor on which the survival of the community as a whole---and
the independent production of the individual households that together
constituted that community---depended. This is true not only of the
martial activities that directly ensured the survival of the community,
but also of the religious activities that cohered the community _as a
community_ and mediated the reproduction of the social relations of
production through which the direct production of the means of life was
carried out. In this sense, the warrior-aristocracy provided the unity
of the community as such, and they did so on the basis of personal
authority and a network of ritually institutionalized relationships,
which guaranteed the sanctity of that authority through the
supersensible power of the gods.<d-footnote>A possible explanation of why the authority that guaranteed the sanctity of the customs and rituals through which social relations were mediated took the form of supersensible or divine power is suggested by Marx in the section of the _Grundrisse_ on pre-capitalist social forms, where he says that in early communal forms of society, both the social and objective presuppositions of direct appropriation though the labor process "are not themselves the _product_ of labor, but appear as its natural or _divine_ presuppositions." Karl Marx, _Grundrisse: Foundations of the Critique of Political Economy (Rough Draft),_ trans. Martin Nicolaus (Penguin, 1993), 472. With this in mind, we can understand the need for divine authority to guarantee personal authority and the institutionalized relationships it was embedded in as a result of the fact that the social conditions of both (such as custom, kinship structures, common language etc) are _presuppositions_ that do not stem from the activity of the individuals that make up the living community themselves.</d-footnote>

The bard was another figure involved in this system of divine sanction,
and it is in the religious structure of Homeric society that connects
the bard and the warrior aristocrat---and in its mytho-poetic
representation---that we can most clearly see the place of truth in
Pre-Archaic Greek social formations, in which it had a different content
and set of conceptual relations than it would come to have in PSM. The
bard was seen as able to imbue action and speech with divine sanction,
though of a particular type: the sanction of the Muses.<d-footnote>Marcel Detienne, _The Masters of Truth in Archaic Greece,_ trans. Janet Lloyd (Zone Books, 1999), 39--42.</d-footnote> The Muses
were the divine personification of _mousa_, sung speech, which was
connected with "laudatory speech".<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 40.</d-footnote> They were also portrayed as the
daughters of Memory (_Mnēmosynē_) and, with their power to know "all
things that were, things to come and things past," they "claim\[ed\] the
privilege of 'speaking the truth.' "<d-footnote>Homer, _Iliad_, trans. Richmond Lattimore (University of Michigan Press, 1951), 1.70, quoted in Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 42--3; Hesiod, _Theogony_, trans. Richmond Lattimore (University of Michigan Press, 1951), 28, 32, and 38, quoted in Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 42--5.</d-footnote> Detienne argues that this sung
speech allowed the bard to "enter into contact with the other world, and
his memory granted him the power to 'decipher the invisible.' "<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 43.</d-footnote> It
is this contact with the invisible world, facilitated by divine,
oracular memory, that allowed the bard, like the Muses, to speak truth,
to confer divine sanction on his words of praise and blame, and the
deeds they referred to, most importantly the deeds of the heroic
warrior-aristocrat.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 45.</d-footnote> It is through the bard that the _kleos_ (glory)
of the warrior was thought to reach not just the ears of the community
and future generations, but up to the heavens.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 46.</d-footnote> In this way the bard
played a role in solidifying the divine sanction that ensures the social
sanctity of the institutions centered around the warrior-aristocracy.

Should we understand this social function of the bard, in which the
truth of their statements was embedded, as merely an ideological support
for the rule of the warrior-aristocrat? This was clearly one aspect of
the bard's function, but even it must be taken in the context of a
social situation in which that rule was based on the role of the
aristocrat in the necessary social labor that ensured the reproduction
of the community. Furthermore, the bards themselves clearly played an
independent role in that necessary labor insofar as their praise and
blame, as well as the broader narrative context in which it was
allocated, did not merely sanction the rule of warrior-aristocracy, but
also preserved and transmitted the customs and broader cultural heritage
through which social relations, both within a community and between
communities in a broader network of alliance and obligation, were
mediated. This is the function that secured their truth, that gave it
its meaning, that vested it in them as bearers of that function, and
that was expressed as an oracular connection with a divine world in
which memory provides access equally to past, present, and future as
elements of an atemporal 'plane of truth.'

At this point, it is useful to compare this mythico-religious conception
of truth with the determination of truth as it would appear once it had
become situated within the conceptual relations of PSM. In the latter,
truth will have taken on the determination that Marcuse identifies with
it of establishing a hierarchical relation between levels of reality in
which one level is taken to be in some sense more "real" than another.
It will also have assumed the connection to unity, universality, and
abstraction that Marcuse posits as characteristic of the concept of
essence. In the earlier bardic conception, despite significant
continuities (which we will return to shortly) the overall determination
of truth is different on both scores. On the first, while it is does
appear to distinguish between two different levels of reality, and does
do so to some extent---i.e. between the divine, atemporal "plane of
truth" and the mortal realm---its real opposition is with oblivion
(lēthē), and its function is primarily to distinguish, within the mortal
realm, and through the action of divine memory, that which is to be
preserved and elevated up to the undying realm of the gods from that
which does not merit preservation and so will be forgotten and sink down
into oblivion.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 47--52*.*</d-footnote> This is a different sorting process from the one
involved in the truth of PSM, one that operates on the basis of moral
categories (praiseworthiness, blameworthiness, glory, etc.) rather than
the logical or metaphysical categories of the latter conception (unity,
universality, abstraction). Even the "unseen world" that the truth of
the bards provides access to is not seen so much as underlying the
mortal world as being parallel to and in constant interaction with it.

Still, the similarities are significant. Most importantly, bardic truth
does posit a division between different planes of reality, one sensible
and mortal, and the other supersensible and in some way atemporal. This
atemporality has a certain ambivalence between the senses of
_immortality_ as that which does not die and _permanence_ as that which
is invariant or eternal. Both of these senses can be seen as related to
the social function of the bard. The first relates to the distinctly
personal and subjective aspects of this function. It is the mechanism of
oral transmission and its characteristic objects (warrior-aristocrats
and their words and deeds) that determine atemporality as immortality,
as an elevation of particular elements of the concrete mortal world to a
special status in which their temporal nature is not so much removed as
infinitely extended by the memory of the bard and the act of
preservation and transmission through the process of telling and
retelling.<d-footnote>As a bad infinity, this process of telling and retelling cannot realize the immortality that it ascribes to its objects. Instead it must inscribe them within the perpetual ought of its own process of reproduction, the instability of which, along with its dependence on continuous reinscription within the living community, probably contributes to the porosity of the boundary between the "unseen world" and the mortal realm, although this is clearly also a product of the need to posit more active divine intervention to ensure the sanctity of ritually inscribed relations whose purely interpersonal basis would leave them relatively insecure.</d-footnote> The second sense is more properly atemporal, in that it
indicates an exteriority to the flow of time, rather than merely being
infinitely extended out into that flow. This is the sense that attaches
to the plane of truth itself, in which past, present and future are seen
as simultaneously accessible, and, in a sense, undifferentiated, or at
least cut off from their temporal ordering. It is not the
personal-subjective aspects of the bards function that underlie this
second sense of atemporality---and so also the basic separation between
the planes that lies at the heart of the determination of truth---but
the social aspect, or the way in which the bard relates to the
reproduction of the social totality, that does so.

In preserving and transmitting the customs and broader cultural heritage
in which the social relations of production and reproduction were
embedded, the bard reproduces the necessary social _presuppositions_ of
the social formation. As presuppositions, these stand outside the
sensuous activity of the community as conditions of communal production
that are not themselves produced by the community. They thus stand
outside the normal process of becoming that characterizes the everyday
life of the community, and bring together past (as pre-existent),
present (as conditions of the current existence of the living community)
and future (as conditions of the continuing reproduction of the
community) in their separation from that process. This can be seen as
the foundation of the second sense of atemporality as being outside the
flow of time, as well as of the basic separation between a sensuous and
temporal plane of reality and a supersensuous and atemporal one on which
the bardic conception of truth as a whole rests.

Despite the otherwise general reconfiguration of the concept of truth in
the time between the bardic conception and that of PSM, in which the
interactive parallelism of the earlier conception became a foundational
relationship based on logical-metaphysical rather than moral categories,
the basic division on the basis of which the latter conception continued
to be structured, between a sensible and temporal realm and a
supersensible and atemporal one, can be seen to have already been
present in the earlier conception. How should we explain this
continuity? Given the basis of the earlier form of the division in the
social function of the bard of reproducing the necessary presuppositions
of the social formation as a whole, it seems reasonable to hypothesize
that the persistence of this division was based on the persistence of
this social function and to posit that the changes in its organization
have their basis in changes in the operation of that function. If we
then look at the historical evidence, we do in fact find that this
function both persists and undergoes significant change. As we shall see
in more detail below, in the later period the impersonal institution of
monetary exchange had come to replace the relational institutions of the
earlier period as the primary form of social mediation on which the
unity of the social formation as such was based, and so also it had
itself become the primary social presupposition on which social
production rested.<d-footnote>This is not to say that custom or religion stopped playing this function entirely---their continued existence attests to their continued functionality---but simply that they no longer occupied the primary position which they had in the earlier relations of production.</d-footnote> With this transformation, the bard, as a
personal, subjective bearer of the function of reproducing this
presupposition, was replaced by money itself as an objective bearer of
that same function. Simultaneously, truth became detached from its
connection to the social function of an individual with whose speech it
was coextensive and began to take on the determinations of the money
form, with its division between a concrete material embodiment and an
abstract value underlying it, and its role as universal equivalent that
provides unity to the diverse commodities related to it in terms of
their value.

As we shall see in the following sections, the emergence of essence in
PSM and its relation to the money form is more complicated than this
correspondence would suggest. For one, the objectification of the
primary social presuppositions of the changing mode of production meant
the dissolution of the direct relationship between speech and the social
function of reproducing those presuppositions. It is this direct
relationship that grounds the truth of bardic speech, and without it,
any assertion of the continuing relevance of that social function to the
determination of truth runs the risk of being reduced to mere homology.
Relatedly, the correspondence on its own is unsatisfactory insofar as it
does not explain why the objectification of the social preconditions of
the process of production resulted in a transformation of the
determination of truth rather than its abandonment as the social system
in which it was embedded collapsed. In fact, there is a divergent
intellectual tendency among the Greek aristocracy that did abandon the
concept of truth after the collapse of the social conditions of its
mytho-religious formulation---the intellectual lineage leading from
Simonides of Ceos down to the sophists and beyond.<d-footnote>For the relation between Simonedes and the Sophists, see Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 107--19.</d-footnote> At the same
time, the early philosophers, in whose thought the concept of essence
emerged, did maintain a degree of continuity with the older conception
of truth, and it was precisely on the grounds of the correspondence
under discussion here that they did so. This continuity of the
correspondence is indicative, and can direct us in the right direction,
but it cannot be taken as an explanation on its own. The questions now
are why the early philosophers maintained this continuity, and in what
ways (and to what extent) were the continuities and differences in their
conception of truth determined by the objectification discussed here. To
answer these questions, we must turn to the historical context in which
both this objectification and the emergence of the concept of essence
took place.

### The Crisis of Aristocracy (2.2)

Filling out the tapestry whose warp has been laid out above means
turning to the transformations wrought by commercialization, military
reform and the consolidation of a slave mode of production in the
development of Greek social formations between the Early Iron Age and
the Archaic Period.<d-footnote>The periodization scheme I am using here is based on the one in Alex Knodell, _Societies in Transition in Early Greece: An Archeological History_ (University of California Press, 2021), 7.</d-footnote> The reciprocal dynamic between
commercialization and the changing mode of exploitation played out over
a number of centuries, and culminated in 1) the crystallization of the
money form out of the process of exchange and 2) consolidation of the
mode of exploitation around private appropriation by a landowning
aristocracy of the surplus produced by unfree labor.<d-footnote>For the concept of unfree labor in Ancient Greece, see G.E.M. De Ste. Croix, _The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World: from the Archaic Age to the Arab Conquests_ (Cornell University Press, 1981), 133--74.</d-footnote> This process
of development is explored in further detail in Appendix 2. For now,
suffice it to say that around the 7th century BCE, these processes had
reached a critical point in which their effects, especially those of
monetization, began to ripple out into society broadly and at an
increasing pace, which was then further accelerated by the invention of
coinage.<d-footnote>On this last point, see Richard Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy_ (Cambridge University Press, 2004).</d-footnote> It is these effects which characterize to a large extent
the profound crises and transformations of the Archaic period, including
the development of Pre-Socratic monism.

Even the most noted change of this period, the development of the
_polis_, can be seen to be a result of this process of commoditization
and monetization. In Appendix 2, I describe how the centers of
concentrated settlement that would develop into the first _poleis_ were
themselves nodes of long distance trade and the expanding commodity
relations that accompany it, as well as the role of this commercial
expansion in the centering of slavery within the primary process of
production. The _polis_, as an urban area that incorporated its
surrounding countryside, on which it was dependent for subsistence, was
made possible by these same developments.

That the typical _polis_ was centered around its _agora_, or
marketplace, is indicative, but even more decisive is the composition of
the _poleis,_ or more specifically, of the _astē._ Their primary
residents were 1) aristocrats enabled to live away from their land
holdings by the surplus labor extracted from slaves, serfs, or debt
bondsman 2) craftsmen whose livelihoods were primarily dependent on
selling commodities to those aristocrats in exchange for the products of
that same surplus labor, and 3) the urban poor who begged or sold their
labor-power to the aristocrats or to the _polis_ itself for a wage.<d-footnote>See De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 114--33, 208--26, 269--78; Moses Finley, _The Ancient Economy,_ Updated Edition (University of California Press, 1999), 123--49. It is the combination of De Ste. Croix's characterization of these groups and emphasis on the importance of unfree labor in the mode of exploitation with Finley's emphasis on the consumptive nature of ancient cities and the importance of the landed aristocracy in that consumption that best allows us to see this point.</d-footnote>
In a _polis_ like Athens, even the funding of public institutions was
derived in large part from the dedications, _eisphorai_ and _liturgoi_
of the aristocrats, in other words from the proceeds of selling the
products of the surplus labor appropriated on their estates as
commodities (and, even in the earliest cases of temple dedications,
these products were exchanged for (often mass produced) objects made of
metal).<d-footnote>For the _eisphorai_ and _liturgoi_, see Michael Gagarin, _Democratic Law in Classical Athens_ (University of Texas Press, 2020), Chapter 1, Kindle. For the mass production of temple dedications, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 102--9.</d-footnote> In this sense, the _polis_ as a whole was a social form
mediated by monetized impersonal relations. The city itself, the _astu_,
which formed the center of the _polis_ and gave it its unity, was
determined as a site of commodity production, exchange, and consumption
above all else. Its development was to a large extent a result of the
increasing interdependence brought on by the increasing division of
labor that arose and expanded along with the expansion of commodity
production and exchange, but it was equally made possible by the changes
in the mode of exploitation that accompanied this commercialization,
which centered the private exploitation of unfree labor on the estates
of aristocratic landowners as the primary mode of surplus appropriation
on which the subsistence of the aristocracy---and the existence of the
broader social formation as such---was based.

In contrast to the personal authority that gave unity to the earlier
social formations discussed above, and the institutions of personal
reciprocity that mediated social relations within and between them, the
monetized exchange relations that formed the primary basis of social
mediation within the polis were impersonal and given objective unity by
money itself as the universal embodiment of commodity-producing human
labor. As the universal equivalent, money is separated off from the
diverse mass of commodities as the material body in which each and all
of them represent their value. It homogenizes the diverse particular
forms of human activity whose products it is exchanged for. When a
commodity producer exchanges their product for money, they exchange it
for the embodiment of human labor in the abstract, for a commodity that
has the exclusive function of representing the value of all other
commodities. In this act of exchange, they posit their concrete,
particular, private labor as abstract, universal, social labor. To the
extent that a member of society produces commodities that they exchange
for money, they posit their labor as social and qualitatively equal with
all the other particular forms of labor that express their values in
money. They posit their own labor as a fraction of the total social
labor, but at the same time as social only insofar as it is exchanged
for money, that is to say only indirectly. In this way the money form
privatizes at the same time as it socializes, obscuring the social
character of the productive activity of the members of society by
embodying it as an external object, and one which can be possessed by an
individual.

This means that social mediation lost its interpersonal basis to the
extent that it became monetized. If a man had money, he didn't need a
patronymic and lineage, nor loyalty, nor customary obligation, nor
reputation, nor martial prowess to exercise social power or accumulate
its trappings; he could pay for whatever product of the labor of others
he wanted or needed and they wouldn't ask who he was or why he wanted
it, so long as they received money in return. To command an army no
longer required one to inhabit a defined place in a hierarchy of
privileges and obligations defined by honor and heredity but merely to
have enough money to pay mercenaries to do your bidding, and this is how
many Tyrants usurped power in the Archaic period and beyond.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 279--83*.*</d-footnote> As I
noted at the end of the last section, it also meant that the formerly
customary and interpersonal social presuppositions of the production and
reproduction of the community became increasingly objectified in money
itself, which gave unity to the now increasingly indirect and
increasingly complex sociality of the different labors involved in the
production and reproduction of the social formation as such.

These developments resulted in a series of acute social crises that
spread out across the Greek Mediterranean as the traditional social
forms that undergirded the personal authority and class cohesion of the
warrior-aristocracy were undermined. These crises began as crises of the
warrior-aristocracy in the face of changing social conditions that then
turned into general social crises---to a large extent as a result of the
aristocratic responses to those very conditions. We already see this
state of crisis expressed in the Homeric epics, both of which revolve
around crises of aristocratic reciprocity and the institutions that
mediated it.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 44.</d-footnote> It is these institutions themselves and the
aristocratic ideals associated with them that explicitly frame the
crises that animate the poems. The greed of Agamemnon and the Suitors
can be seen as results of the new incentives for accumulation that
accompany commercialization and that now outweighed the traditional
imperatives for the leader to make a fair distribution or the guests to
respect the hospitality of their host. Inversely, the refusal of
Achilles to accept anything in exchange for his honor shows the
unsuitability of the heroic ideal to the developing forms of social
mediation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 38.</d-footnote> Finally, although there are other examples that could be
given, the need for divine intervention to prevent the spiraling out of
retribution and blood feud as a result of Odysseus' decidedly heroic and
honorable killing of the suitors shows the unsustainability of such
forms of retribution in an increasingly (commercially) integrated
society that had increasingly little place for the interpersonal
violence that surrounded the warrior-aristocrat and which in many ways
constituted his distinguishing feature.<d-footnote>This divine intervention is also indicative insofar as it is the gods, those supreme guarantors of aristocratic rule and superiority, who the poet ultimately relies on to resolve the seemingly insoluble contradictions arising from the system of honor and retribution in the mortal world.</d-footnote>

The Homeric response to the crisis laid out in the poems is
characteristic of the overall aristocratic response to crisis in its
tendency to lionize the outmoded institutions and values that previously
upheld and legitimized aristocratic rule while ignoring or degrading the
elements of change that undercut its viability. In a sense the
aristocracy as a class acted in similar fashion to Achilles or Odysseus,
obstinately trying to hold on to their honor, to the system of values
and institutions in which their power and their way of life were
embedded, in the face of a reality that ensured that this attempt would
lead them to ruin. This impulse to double down on the traditional ideals
and modes of conduct in the face of changing circumstances is part of
what spelled trouble for the hereditary aristocracy in the context of a
social world in which the development of commodity relations had created
more integrated social formations with new incentives for accumulation
of individual wealth, and possibly had also reduced the tolerance of the
lower classes, especially the upper strata of these lower classes, for
being treated as targets of appropriation rather than partners to an
equal exchange.<d-footnote>Cf. Marx, _Capital, vol. I,_ 178*.* Aristotle also gives an example of this dynamic in the _Politics,_ when he describes the way the ruling family of the hereditary aristocracy of Mytilene, the Penthilidae, used to go around beating people over the head with clubs, until they were attacked in turn by a certain Megacles who took offense to this behavior. Aristotle, _Politics,_ in _The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation_, vol. 2, ed. Jonathan Barnes (Princeton University Press, 2014), 2082.</d-footnote>

The fuller extent of this dynamic comes into view when we look at what
we know of the early laws of Athens and the circumstances that gave
birth to them. The homicide law of Drako is clearly a response to the
untenability of inter-elite blood feuds and the general impression we
have of the seventh century BCE is that it was riven by crises arising
from this kind of violent inter-elite strife within the hereditary
aristocracy and between them and newer claimants to wealth and
power.<d-footnote>See, e.g., Federica Carugati, "Athens Before the Crisis," in _Creating a Constitution: Law, Democracy and Growth in Ancient Athens_ (Princeton University Press, 2019), 23--4. Solon too can be seen to be concerned not so much with supporting the lower classes as with curbing those aristocratic practices which threatened the stability of the community as such, as argued by Harris in Edward M. Harris, "A Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" in _The Development of the Polis in Archaic Greece_, ed. Lynette G. Mitchell and P.J. Rhodes (Routledge, 1997), 111.</d-footnote> It is also clear from the laws of Solon and his description
of the crisis that prompted his intervention that this kind of
inter-elite conflict had broadened out into a general breakdown of
social order in which the type of raiding we saw as a key part of the
surplus appropriation of the old warrior-aristocracy became common
_within_ the _polis,_ leading to the enslavement of citizens and
accelerating the impoverishment of the small peasants and their growing
indebtedness.<d-footnote>Harris, "A New Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" 106.</d-footnote> We should see this internal breakout of violent
appropriation of land, people and goods as the one of the final
obstinate spasms of the declining warrior-aristocracy in the face of
their changing circumstances. Indeed, the Solonian legislation was the
first in a series of upheavals and constitutional changes that
registered and expanded the power of the _demos_, the lower classes, and
laid the foundations for democracy.

At the same time, this violent spasm was not just the death rattle of an
old form of aristocracy, it was also the final labor pang in the birth
of a new form. One of its most significant functions was to allow the
consolidation of land in the hands of the aristocrats through direct
violence, debt and the exercise of political power, thereby establishing
the basis of their continuing supremacy within the emerging relations of
exploitation.

Solon's laws also abolished the _hektemoroi_, the situation in which a
portion of the population had to pay one-sixth part of their product to
others. Harris argues that this did not represent the abolition of debt
or the ending of a type of serfdom, as has been traditionally argued,
but rather the prohibition of tribute payments like those seen in the
Homeric epics, but which had become formalized into a system of fixed
payments.<d-footnote>Harris, "A New Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" 103--11</d-footnote> If this is correct, then it would represent an even more
explicit sweeping away of the last vestiges of the traditional mode of
exploitation of the warrior-aristocracy. Whether this represents the
abolition of debt, the ending of a serf-like system or the abolition of
tribute payments, it---coupled with the concentration of landed property
in aristocratic hands, the increased legal protections and expansion of
the scope of the courts, and the ban on enslavement of Athenian
citizens---would have cleared the way for the consolidation of the mode
of production around the commercialized polis---where dispossessed
peasants would have had to have gone and become artisans, beggars or
hired laborers (outcomes encouraged by other elements of the laws
attributed to Solon, such as banning the export of grain and requiring
fathers to teach their sons a trade)---on the basis of the aristocratic
exploitation of slave labor on large landed estates in the
countryside.<d-footnote>On the other Solonian Laws, see Carugati, "Athens Before the Crisis," 24.</d-footnote>

It is also worth noting in connection with this that Solon made
wealth---defined by agricultural output---the primary criteria for
political participation, which likely expanded the base of that
participation to certain upper-middle strata who had previously been
excluded, even if the distinctions between the 'classes' were fairly
fine and all referred to owners of substantial amounts of property, as
Osborne argues.<d-footnote>Robin Osborne, _Greece in the Making: 1200--497 BC,_ 2nd ed. (Routledge, 2009), 208.</d-footnote> With these changes---already developing before the
Solonian reforms and continuing to be given further definition after,
but for which the Solonian crisis and its purported solution represented
a decisive shift---we see how the death throes of the old
warrior-aristocracy, and the aristocratic reaction against them, led to
their transformation into an aristocracy defined by ownership of the
primary means of production (land) and the exploitation of slave labor.

Across the Greek Mediterranean, the primary agents in the overthrow of
the old aristocratic political order were a series of figures known as
tyrants (among whom some count Solon himself, although he was somewhat
unusual in being appointed to resolve the civil strife in Athens rather
than seizing power by force). The tyrants were not just agents but also
expressions of the crisis of aristocracy---and of the class struggle
that it was enmeshed with. They often rose to power using the new means
made available to them by the process of commercialization and the
conflict generated by the exhaustion of traditional modes of
aristocratic power. They played aristocratic factions and clans off each
other, took up the causes of the burgeoning middle strata of medium
sized landowners and larger landowners excluded from the hereditary
aristocracy's monopoly on political power (some of whom probably derived
their wealth from commercial activities before using it to buy land),
played on the discontent among the lower strata of small and
dispossessed peasants, hired mercenaries to back their coups, and bought
off important people and segments of the population either directly or
through public expenditure. Many of these means were based directly on
money as a new impersonal form of social power that could be accumulated
by an individual and used to purchase things (status, good will,
military forces) traditionally reserved for those who had personal
authority issuing from their place in a system of defined social roles
and obligations. Others were based on the conditions of class struggle
associated with large-scale shifts in social relations produced by both
commercialization and the consolidation of a slave mode of production.
It was these conditions that were decisive for the tyrants writ large
and that defined their overall historical role in breaking the political
control of the hereditary warrior-aristocracy and expanding the class
base of political participation.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 279--83.</d-footnote>

Along with commercialization, changes in the mode of exploitation, and
the class struggle that accompanied these, the final major factor that
drove the crisis of aristocracy in the Archaic was a shift in the
organization and conduct of warfare known as the Hoplite Revolution.
Though the orthodox position that a revolution in the conduct of
warfare---in which the adoption of the hoplite panoply and phalanx
tactics led to the increasing importance of a middling stratum of
independent farmers in the composition of Greek armies starting in the
7th century BCE, and, as a result, to the increasing political and
social power of this middling stratum---remains controversial, and
continues to be challenged in many of its details, Hanson persuasively
argues that it holds up in its broad strokes.<d-footnote>Victor Davis Kagan, "The Hoplite Narrative," in _Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece,_ ed. Donald Kagan and Gregory F. Viggiano (Princeton University Press, 2013), 256--70.</d-footnote> This "revolution"
would have displaced the traditional warrior-aristocracy from its
central position in the necessary communal labor of warfare, thereby
further undermining the traditional base of their position within the
class structure of their social formations and so of the legitimacy of
their rule. Combined with the other factors discussed above, this
represented a complete break with the former social relations that had
upheld the warrior-aristocracy as a class and erosion of the basis for
their own self-conception. It created a crisis in which the very
definition of aristocracy was called into question at the same time as
the aristocrats found themselves increasingly embattled with challenges
to their position from below. In a certain sense, the erosion of the
religious and military basis of their previous mode of exploitation left
them with little justification for their rule and position in society
aside from bare exploitation itself, which would've provided little
ideological support in the face of challenges from the tyrants and
demands for increasing rights and privileges from the rising middle
strata and the lower classes that often formed the broader social base
of their struggles. Add to this the fact that attempts to cling to the
old ways were actively creating dysfunction and only increasing the
strife, and it is clear that an ideological shift needed to take place,
both in terms of legitimation and practical orientation, in order for
the aristocracy to re-consolidate itself and its place in the fledgling
relations of production that were arising around it.

It is in the context of this need that we should understand the
development and spread of Pre-Socratic Monism and the concept of essence
which emerged within it. But, before turning to PSM itself, it is useful
to look at the writings of Theognis of Megara, in which we can see
evidence of the shifting aristocratic response to this crisis and the
changes it brought to the determination of truth even before development
of PSM.

### Theognis: A Transitional Conception of Truth (2.3)

The poems attributed to Theognis are thought to have been written
sometime between 650 and 550 BCE, thus firmly within the early period of
the acute crisis of aristocracy that I have been discussing, but
slightly before (or contemporaneous with) the first thinkers of PSM. In
them, the poet bemoans the state of affairs in his polis, where, "this
city is a city still, but lo! her people are other men, who of old knew
neither judgments nor laws, but wore goatskins to pieces about their
sides, and had their pasture like deer without this city; and now they
be good men, O son of Polypaus, and they that were high be now of low
estate."<d-footnote>Theognis, "The Elegiac Poems of Theognis," in _Elegy and Iambus,_ vol. 1, Perseus Digital Library, 53--60.</d-footnote> These new men from the countryside, who the poet feels has
usurped the place of his aristocratic peers, are distinguished
throughout the poems by their attaining their position as a result of
wealth (_ploutos)_ rather than by being of good stock. The other
oppositions that structure the poems are between truth---both as honesty
and reality---and deception (or falsity), and between the good and the
bad. These oppositions are structured in such a way that truth is
aligned with good stock (heredity) and falsity/deception with wealth,
while the good and the bad stand in an ambiguous and reversible position
with respect to the others as a result of the falsity and deception
generated by wealth. It is anxiety over the difficulty involved in
distinguishing the _truly_ good, which is aligned with heredity, but
under the corrupting influence of wealth requires supplemental qualities
to distinguish it---qualities like intelligence/judgment (_gnōmē_),
power (_dynamis_, which still has its bodily/martial strength
connotations, but has taken on a sense of authority/influence that is
probably more operative here*)*, and moderation or self control---from
the mere appearance of goodness created by wealth.<d-footnote>Moderation or self-control are most directly expressed in terms of taking the _messēn hodon_, the middle road or being _mesos_, in the middle.</d-footnote> At the same
time, despite the identification of wealth with corruption, this process
of discernment is explicitly aligned with the discernment of legitimate
currency from counterfeit, which is used as a model for the difference
between outward appearance (_ideai)_ and a true, inner content (such as
a person's mind or heart).<d-footnote>Theognis, "The Elegiac Poems of Theognis," 119--28.</d-footnote>

The first thing to note here is that unlike in the Homeric picture of
the crisis that we discussed above, the commercial origins of the more
acute crisis faced by Theognis can no longer be omitted or downplayed.
At the same time, the effects of commercialization---represented here by
wealth (the abstract expression of which is almost certainly a sign of
its monetization)---can still be, and constantly are, denigrated and
disavowed. This shows a certain continuity in the aristocratic response
to commercialization and its effects---despite the shift in emphasis
from omission and downplaying to denigration and disavowal, and despite
the explicit foregrounding of (the bearers of) monetized wealth as the
cause of the crisis.

The second is that heredity has become the defining feature of
aristocracy rather than honor or martial prowess, despite the
supplemental quality power (authority/influence) preserving some residue
of the origins of the former in the latter. On the other hand, the other
two supplemental qualities represent newer values that were absent in
the Homeric portrayal of the warrior-aristocrat (although we might see a
precursor to the foregrounding of judgment in the craftiness of
Odysseus), ones determined by the crisis and changing material basis of
aristocracy itself. It is telling in this respect that one of the
primary meanings of judgment within the poems seems to be the ability to
correctly discern who and what is truly good in the face of the
deceptive appearances generated by wealth, which is to say that
judgment, as a definitional attribute of true aristocracy entails to a
large extent the very ability to distinguish the aristocratic from the
common. In this sense we could say that in Theognis, the aristocratic
value system that upheld the legitimacy of the Homeric
warrior-aristocrat has been evacuated of much of its concrete meaning
and reduced to a bare status distinction the primary determination of
which---heredity---is not substantial enough to clearly delineate it in
the eyes of even its defenders.

The third thing of note is that the conception of truth put forward here
represents a sort of intermediate conception between the mytho-religious
and philosophical conceptions discussed above in relation to bardic
truth. In Theognis, truth had not yet taken on its relationship to the
metaphysical categories of unity, universality, and abstraction that it
would in the concept of essence. Its sorting process still operated on
the basis of moral criteria (albeit new moral criteria) and took people,
words, and deeds as its characteristic objects. It was concerned with
separating the good (aristocratic) person---or their actions, words or
intentions---from the bad, though this had already become a process that
functioned on the basis of a split between hierarchically ordered levels
of reality, between sensible outward appearances and an imperceptible
true content seen to underlies them.<d-footnote>The modeling of this separation on the difference between either the exchange value of a commodity and its use-value, or between the material body of gold and silver and their value---which underlie the ability to counterfeit, or to find that the money you exchanged for was not actually equal to the value of the commodities exchanged for it---is already suggestive of the influence of money on this reconfiguration.</d-footnote> It also still maintained a
connection between truth and the social position of its bearer, although
the privileged position had shifted from that of the bard to that of the
aristocrat himself. On the whole, it is a conception of truth that
appears relatively confused and empty of content. The possibility of
accessing the truth underlying an appearance seems uncertain, as do the
criteria on which the distinction between the true and the deceptive
should be based. Even the criteria that are put forward are either
themselves unstable and insufficient, like heredity, or relatively empty
and circular, like judgment. In this sense, Theognis' conception of
truth gives voice to a problem that it does not have the conceptual
resources to address, or even formulate clearly.

At the end of Part 1, I argued that the transition from the bardic
conception of truth to that of PSM was a result of the objectification
of the function of reproducing the primary social presuppositions that
underlie the existence of the social formation as a whole. Theognis
lived in a social formation in which this objectification was relatively
incomplete and it is on that basis that we can understand the
incompleteness of his conception of truth. This incomplete
objectification had proceed to the point where the individual-subjective
aspects of the social function of the bard had been supplanted, but the
generalization of monetary mediation had not yet reached the point that
it would after the introduction of coinage, and so the position of money
as the primary presupposition of the social totality had not been fully
solidified.<d-footnote>For a similar, though ultimately divergent, account of this objectification and the role of coinage in it using different terminology, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote>

It is also in this light that we should see the inaccessibility of truth
in Theognis, as well as the relative diminishment of the importance of
atemporality in his conception of it. It is because the social function
of the bard had broken down and the reproduction of the social
presuppositions had not yet found a stable bearer in money that the
status of the truth, which had previously been grounded in that
function, became uncertain<d-footnote>Clearly it is not just the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social totality that had become uncertain in this period, but the reproduction of the social totality as a whole, as evidenced by the consistent civil strife discussed above.</d-footnote>. Without such stable presuppositions,
the sense of atemporality that derived from their role _as
presuppositions_ faded away, and although there was still a
differentiation between sensible appearance and a supersensible content
underlying it present, there was not a strong sense that this was
accompanied by the corresponding temporal-atemporal distinction that was
attached to it in both the preceding and succeeding conceptions. Even
the sense that these are distinct planes of reality has now become
confused; it is dirempted between the flattening entailed by it being a
person's heart or mind that serves as the object of the truth-appearance
distinction and the heightening of the distinction to the point of
separation implied in the anxiety over whether truth can be apprehended
at all.

Additionally, the opposition between the material body of money and its
value had not been brought out into the full clarity that it would
achieve after the introduction of coinage. In the distinction between
legitimate and counterfeit coinage that undergirds Theognis' conception
of truth, it is the material body of money (its weight, purity, etc.)
that distinguishes the true from the false, whereas, with the
introduction of coinage, the heightened visibility of the difference
between a coins value and the value of the metal it is coined from will
reverse this relation---making it the abstract value rather than the
material body of money that takes precedence---and thereby facilitate
the transition to a conception of truth centered around the
determinations of money as the embodiment of value, i.e. unity,
universality and abstraction.

It is the combination of both of these factors---the incomplete
objectification of the primary social presuppositions and the
underdevelopment of the opposition between use-value and value---that
explains the peculiarities of Theognis conception of truth, especially
the incompleteness and problematic character of it that led us to see it
as intermediate or transitional. In the poems of Theognis a new
conception of truth began to emerge from the husk of the old, just as in
his social situation a new mode of production was being born from the
crisis of the preceding forms. It is only with the consolidation of this
new mode, whose fundamental moments were monetary mediation and the
exploitation of slave labor, that the fledgling determination of truth
glimpsed in his works was able to develop into the fully-fledged concept
of essence that characterized the thought of the Pre-Socratic Monists.

As we shall see in Part 3, this did not happen of its own accord---a
brute movement of the economic base that resounded through the
superstructure and can be interpreted on the basis of homology. It was
rather a reciprocal process in which certain conceptions were taken up
and developed by certain (class-determined) subjects in response to the
economic and social transformations facing them and on the basis of the
functionality of those conceptions for those subjects within the class
struggle that situated them, and, perhaps, on an inability on the part
of those subjects to recognize the true content of the value form.

## 3. Pre-Socratic Monism

### Money & Pre-Socratic Monism (3.1)

It is now time to turn to the emergence of the concept of essence itself
and begin to build an account of its socio-historical determination. In
this section, I will build off of Richard Seaford's account of the
relationship between money and Pre-Socratic Monism in _Money and the
Early Greek Mind_ in order to establish a baseline conception of this
relation. Then, in the next section, I will provide a critique of
Seaford's account, showing how it runs into many of the same pitfalls
that we saw earlier in Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel. This critique will
provide a basis for developing my own positive conception of this
relationship and its broader socio-historical determination in the third
section. There, I will argue that it is only by understanding the
determination of the concept of abstract substance developed in PSM in
terms of its _function_ as part of an aristocratic ideological project
in response to the crisis outlined above that we can explain it
adequately.

The great merit of Seaford's analysis of the relationship between money
and Pre-Socratic thought, and what sets him apart from Marcuse and
Sohn-Rethel, is the attention he pays to the concrete conditions in
which this relationship developed. In part, this attention to the
concrete is probably a product of general intellectual orientation and
training as a classicist, but it is also a result of his delimitation of
his object of investigation to what he identifies as the emergence of a
specifically metaphysical content in the thought of the
Pre-Socratics.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175. See especially n. 2.</d-footnote> He describes this metaphysical content as "the
counter-intuitive idea of a single substance underlying the plurality of
things manifest to the senses," which allows the Pre-Socratics to
develop an "idea of the universe as an _intelligible order_ subject to
the _uniformity_ of _impersonal_ power," and is distinguished as
metaphysical by the "concern with reality as opposed to appearance, with
what is fundamental as opposed to what is derivative, and with
comprehensive as opposed to partial understanding."<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 175.</d-footnote> Despite the
inclusion in his description of broader cosmological considerations,
concern with comprehensiveness, and the genesis of metaphysics as a
discourse, all of which fall outside the scope of our own investigation
(without therefore being dismissed as legitimate considerations), it is
clear that the central determinations of this content are the same ones
we have been describing as those of the concept of essence: unity,
universality, abstraction and truth.

The most important consequence of the concreteness enabled by this
delimitation is that Seaford, unlike Marcuse or Sohn-Rethel, is able to
offer an explanation of why the emergence of the concept of essence
occurred at the specific time and in the specific places that it did.
His answer to these questions will ultimately turn out to be incomplete,
but they provide us with many of the building blocks out of which my own
explanation will be built. For Seaford, the most important of these
changes is the introduction of coinage, which both leads to an
intensification of the pace and extent of monetization and to a
development of the opposition between use-value and value inherent in
money.<d-footnote>For the first, see especially, Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 126--9, 134--6, and 198--209; For the second, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 171.</d-footnote> He does a thorough job of demonstrating that these are the
primary terms in which the social formations in which PSM emerged and
developed can be differentiated from the others in which it did
not.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175--89, 198--200, 209--10, and 244, n. 75.</d-footnote> As a result of this, we have a plausible case for identifying
the rapid monetization and development of the opposition between
use-value and value that followed the introduction of coinage as
decisive conditions of the emergence and development of PSM, even if we
can't yet specify how this relationship was established.

Seaford also further specifies the significance of these two factors to
the development of PSM and its central concept of abstract substance in
ways that align with our exposition at the end of Part 2. He argues that
rapid monetization results in what he calls the "social transcendence"
of "monetary value" which he aligns with the "integrative power" of
money, that explains the impersonal cosmology of the Pre-Socratics.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote>
Furthermore, it is the fetishism of the commodity, in which social
relations become embodied in an external _thing_, a thing on which
"individual autonomy and prosperity and collective cohesion and
prosperity seem to depend," that Seaford sees as the ground of the
"unconscious cosmological projection" of the money form into the thought
determinations of PSM (on which more below).<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote> All this points to the
complete objectification of the function of reproducing the social
presuppositions of the social formation as a whole that we highlighted
as still missing in our analysis of the Theognis' transitional form of
truth above. It is the generalization of monetary mediation as result of
the introduction of coinage that allows this objectification to be
completed. Once it is, we find that truth too has achieved a stable form
in the concept of abstract substance, in which the hierarchical ordering
of levels of reality has become attached to the determinations of unity,
universality and abstraction, which are themselves determinations of the
money form and the abstract value it embodies. It has also begun to
regain the sense of distinction between the planes and association of
the true with atemporality that it had in bardic conception, although
these would only become fully realized with the completion of the
progressive abstraction of PSM in the thought of Parmenides.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 206, 211, 231, 237 and 244--6</d-footnote> This
does not take us beyond the homology we have established in the
preceding sections, but it does confirm it and expand our understanding
of the grounds of its development in PSM.

In a similar fashion, Seaford's account of the development of the
opposition between concrete use-value and abstract value in coinage
confirms and expands our understanding of its role in the development of
PSM. He argues that coinage brings out this opposition, in two ways. The
first is by diminishing the importance of the material qualities of the
metal (its weight, purity, etc.) in favor of abstract quantity (the
determinations of unit and amount) and the second is by establishing a
"systematic discrepancy between the conventional value of a coin and the
concrete value of its bullion."<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 171.</d-footnote> Together, these increase the
visibility of the opposition between use-value and value, and in doing
so bring forward the mysterious ideality of value, the way it appears to
be an abstract, supersensible element of every commodity, and one that
is independent of their concrete material properties and origins.<d-footnote>Cf. Marx, _Capital,_ vol. I, 163--4.</d-footnote>
It is this same ideality that characterizes the abstract substance of
PSM, which, like value, is conceived of as an abstract universal that
unifies the diverse multiplicity of concrete sensible particulars that
it is separated off from. Similarly, the progressive abstraction that
Seaford emphasizes in the development of PSM from Thales to Parmenides
follows the contours of the opposition between abstract value and its
concrete monetary embodiment, moving from conceptions that resemble
money in being themselves concrete objects separated off from all others
as the universal equivalent, the object-type in which their qualitative
differences are extinguished and equalized, to those that resemble value
in being a pure abstraction, divested of material qualities except
insofar as it is embodied in the things that represent its form of
appearance.

In addition to the introduction of coinage, Seaford's concreteness
allows him to specify a number of other important socio-historical
conditions of the emergence of the concept of abstract substance,
although, without an explicit concept of the mode of production, he is
left to present them (for the most part) as an external aggregate of
independent conditions, which prevents him from giving an adequate
account of the determinate relationships between them. The most
important of these are the crisis of the traditional social order
centered around the warrior-aristocracy, the class struggle that
accompanied the rise of the Tyrants, and the aristocratic ideology of
self sufficiency.<d-footnote>It should be noted here that all three of these suggest an implicit recognition of the importance of the mode of production and its class structure for explaining the emergence and development of PSM, registering some of the effects of the transition that we described above without being able to articulate them together as moments of a totality.</d-footnote> In terms of the first two of these, aside from
providing material that was used in constructing our account of the
crisis described in Section 2.2 (and Appendix 2), the main thing that
Seaford provides us with is confirmation that the social formations in
which PSM developed were experiencing acute manifestations of that
crisis.<d-footnote>Such as the fact that all of the _poleis_ in which PSM emerged and developed were either experiencing, or had recently experienced, the rule of a tyrant and/or heightened class antagonism. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 183.</d-footnote>

The third, on the other hand, introduces a new consideration, and one
that will play an important part in my own conception of the social
determination of PSM. Seaford introduces this ideological consideration
in his discussion of Parmenides in order to explain the "problem of
_why_ value is abstracted from circulation."<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 246.</d-footnote> He thinks that this
abstraction of value from circulation lies at the basis of the
differences between Parmenides' concept of substance, which resembles
monetary value in its total abstraction, and the substance concepts of
his predecessors, which combine elements of both value and circulation
in their relative concretion.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 246.</d-footnote> The aristocratic ideology of self
sufficiency, which finds its _locus classicus_ in Aristotle's
formulation that, "it is the mark of an _eleutheros_ (free man,
gentleman) not to live for the benefit of another," is introduced as an
external ideological factor that acts on the homologous relationship
between money and the philosophical content of PSM, unconsciously
motivating the separation of abstract value from concrete
circulation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247; De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World_, 90, 116--7; 2014, _Rhetoric_, in _The Complete Works of Aristotle:The Revised Oxford Translation,_ ed. Jonathan Barnes, 2176 (1367a32), where the translation is "\...not to live at another's beck and call."</d-footnote> In doing so, it makes self-sufficiency, which Seaford
thinks is already latent in the determination of value, into one of the
central determinations that defines abstract substance.

This ideological determination of PSM brings us closer to our own
concern with its ideological character, although it doesn't go far
enough in that direction insofar as it posits the ideological as an
external influence that shapes the development of the concept of
abstract substance---and does so at a relatively late stage in this
development. This relative externality of ideological considerations to
the determination of the substance concept of PSM raises the question of
what, for Seaford, differentiates the ideological character of the
concept of self-sufficiency from the supposedly non-ideological
character of the money-derived content of the concept of substance.
Seaford does not explicitly spell this out, but it is clear from the way
he discusses self-sufficiency that it must be the derivation of the
former concept from the class structure of the social formations in
question---and from the position of the aristocracy within that
structure---that marks it as ideological.

Following De Ste. Croix, Seaford describes the "ideology of economic
self-sufficiency" as an expression of the "crucial opposition between
those who by virtue of their command over the labor power of others were
_free_ to lead a civilized life (the 'propertied class') and those who
had to work to maintain themselves."<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247.</d-footnote> The class character of this
ideology is introduced in this way only to be dropped and never
mentioned again as the discussion turns back to the determination of
self-sufficiency and its relation to the monetary determinations of
substance.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247. It is also, as far as I can tell, the only time in which he makes explicit reference to the mode of production in _Money and the Early Greek Mind_.</d-footnote> This is what leads us to identify class origins as the
distinguishing mark of ideological content for Seaford. It thereby also
allows him to posit the other content of the concept of abstract
substance in PSM as non-ideological insofar as it can be seen to
_originate_ from the determinations of the money form rather than from
the class structure of the social formations in which that concept
emerged and developed. This definition of ideology in terms of origins
both obscures the ideological character of PSM as a whole and removes
the questions of the mode of production and the reciprocal determination
of its elements from consideration. As we shall see below, it is only by
understanding PSM as determined from the beginning by its ideological
function and class character that we can begin to offer an adequate
explanation of its origins and development.

### Critiquing Seaford's Formalism (3.2)

As I said at the beginning of the last section, Seaford's account of the
emergence and development of PSM gets us a long way towards our goal of
explaining the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence.
In this section, I will identify the aspects of Seaford's analysis of
the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic Monism that make it
insufficient in relation to this goal. I will argue that this
insufficiency is related to the formalistic framework of his project,
which bears a number of similarities to the aspects of the works of
Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel that I criticized at the beginning of this
piece.

The formalism of Seaford's approach can be detected in both its aims and
its method. It aims at showing that money, or monetization, is a
necessary historical condition of possibility of the "genesis and form"
of the "metaphysical preconceptions about the basic constituent of the
world and its transformations" shared by the various pre-socratic
philosophers, or, in other words, of "the counter-intuitive idea of a
single substance underlying the plurality of things manifest to the
senses."<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greak Mind,_ 12 and 175.</d-footnote> Although this is not identical to the Kantian idealism
that we saw in Sohn Rethel's attempt to establish the necessary
conditions of possibility of both "scientific cognition" and exchange
itself in terms of the normative "postulates," it still partakes of some
of the same formalism, and even has something of the same form insofar
as Seaford tends to frame his arguments about the monetary origin of
said "preconceptions" in terms of their non-derivability from
observation or deduction.<d-footnote>See, e.g. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 252.</d-footnote> The aim of this project is formalist
insofar as it aims at establishing the formal grounds of the possibility
of PSM, rather than explaining the _actuality_ of its socio-historical
determination.<d-footnote>The focus on giving a historical explanation of the seeming _apriority_ of its preconceptions adds to this formalism</d-footnote> It is the latter that is our aim here, and this
involves giving an account of why, and how, the form determinations of
money were taken up into thought (in a disguised form) as the content
determinations of abstract substance, rather than simply establishing
the necessity (or at least plausibility) of the origination of the
latter in the former.

Seaford's argumentative method, while perhaps adequate to this aim, is
constrained by the same formalism insofar as it centers around
establishing that there is a (relatively complete) homology between the
determinations of money and those of abstract substance, then
eliminating other possible sources of the content of the latter (or
assimilating them under the dominant influence of the monetary
determinations on either historical or formal grounds (i.e. by showing
the relative incompleteness of the homology between these and abstract
substance), thereby establishing money as the source of those conceptual
determinations.<d-footnote>See, e.g. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175--89, 205--9, 217--30 and 246--9. I am not primarily concerned here with the intrinsic weaknesses of this method, although I will note here that these center around the bad infinity of possible conditions and combinations of conditions that necessarily lie outside its eliminative procedure.</d-footnote> In this methodology, the aim of establishing money
or monetization as a historical condition of possibility of the concept
of monistic substance and the reliance on homology reciprocally
determine each other. One the one had, It is only because the historical
conditions of PSM are understood as conditions of possibility, and
therefore formal conditions, that their "influence" on the latter is
able to be analyzed primarily in terms of the formal relationship
established by homology. On the other, it is only because that
"influence" is understood in terms of homologous correspondence--which
allows them to be understood as independent factors whose external
conditioning of thought can be registered and isolated out in terms of
the presence or absence of shared content--that Seaford is able to
determine those historical conditions as _conditions of possibility_ of
the concept of abstract substance.<d-footnote>Even the dismissal of certain other conditions on the basis of historical, rather than formal, criteria would not be enough to identify monetization as the decisive condition that differentiates between the circumstances in which PSM emerged and those in which it didn't without the supplementary evidence supplied by the relatively more complete homology of the content determinations of money with those of PSM compared to those other factors.</d-footnote> This reciprocally determining
formalism also explains the externality and independence of the
conditions in their relationship to each other and to PSM that we noted
in the last section, as well as their determination as origins or
sources of the content of PSM.

Seaford does attempt to offer an explanatory mechanism that could bridge
the gap between socio-historical conditions of possibility and the
actual relationship between thought and those conditions, but it is
caught up in many of the same problems as his overall approach. His
proposal for addressing both the why and the how of the homology between
the money form and the substance concept of PSM is the "unconscious
cosmological projection of abstract monetary substance."<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 12.</d-footnote> He
portrays this unconscious cosmological projection of money (or of its
universal power and exchangeability) as a particular instance of a more
general phenomenon in which cosmic order is unconsciously imagined on
the basis of the dominant human social institutions in a given
society.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 11 and 224--5. The inadequacy of unconscious cosmological projection as an explanation of the relationship between monetization and PSM can already be seen here in the slippage between monetary substance, which presumably refers to value as an _abstract object_ distinguishable from its _concrete monetary form of appearance_, and the universal power and exchangeability of money, which refer to _social functions_ of money arising from the concrete instantiation of value in the process and relations of exchange. Universal power in particular should not be seen as a property of money itself, but as a description of one of the social functions that it has for its possessors. This confusion about what exactly is being projected produces a certain looseness that facilitates the overall argument but simultaneously reduces its clarity and raises questions about its validity.</d-footnote> The determinate difference between PSM and other instances
of this projection would then be the fact that the cosmic order takes on
the abstract and impersonal determinations of money rather than, for
example, the personal characteristics of the monarchical household or
the redistributive form of the sacrificial feast.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 11 and 224--5.</d-footnote> In this
conception, PSM, "like all representations of the cosmos...attempts to
discover order and uniformity underlying apparent chaos."<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote> Seaford
thus suggests a transhistorical psychological mechanism that responds to
a transhistorical psychological need for order and uniformity, in which
objects are projected or "imagined" as a model for cosmological
representation because they stand out as embodiments of order in their
societies, and so can be "abstracted from the potential chaos of
experience."<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote>

The largest problem with this explanation is that the concept of
projection itself is vague and Seaford does nothing to clarify the sense
in which he is using it. As Laplanche and Pontalis had already pointed
out in 1967, projection has been used in a number of different, often
ill defined, senses, most of which can be reduced down to a general
notion of displacement or externalization of an element (typically a
psychological or neurological element).<d-footnote>Jean Laplanche and Jean-Bertrand Pontalis, _The Language of Psychoanalysis_, trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith (Routledge, 2018), 349.</d-footnote> In contrast to this is the
psychoanalytic conception, in which this externalization is predicated
on a rejection of or refusal to recognize the projected element (as
belonging to the subject).<d-footnote>Laplanche, _Language of Psychoanalysis,_ 349.</d-footnote> Seaford gives no indication of using
projection in the more specified psychoanalytic sense, despite this
leaving no explanation for _why_ this projection happens aside from a
similarly vague (and, in my opinion, highly suspect) assertion of a
transhistorical relation between cosmological representations and
"attempts to discover order and uniformity underlying apparent
chaos."<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224. Note the similarity to Marcuse's 'quest for unity and universality.'</d-footnote> Indeed, the element supposed to be projected, "human
institutions" which are the "elements of the familiar that "especially
embody the order and uniformity that is abstracted from the potential
chaos of experience," is similarly indeterminate (and therefore both
highly contestable and at the same time imbued with an immediate sense
of plausibility).<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote> Not only that, but the unconscious nature of the
proposed projection relies on a similarly underdetermined notion of the
unconscious that leaves out the psychoanalytic emphasis on repression as
a constitutive factor in unconscious operations, which leaves us with
little idea as to what causes the unconscious repression and projection
of social institutions, as opposed to a conscious transformation of the
material in thought. Ultimately, the only answers Seaford provides as to
why we should take unconscious cosmological projection to be the
mechanism through which money determines the ideas introduced by PSM are
non-answers insofar as they do little more than re-assert the existence
of the formal correspondence established by his general approach---a
correspondence they were meant to explain.

Another reason for the inadequacy of Seaford's account for our purposes
is that he doesn't give enough consideration to the _function_ of PSM,
or its central metaphysical concepts, within the broader social
situation that they arise in, or within the determinate class relations
that condition the individuals who developed it. This further consigns
his explanation to its repetitive dependence on the homology between the
money form and the concept of abstract substance and prevents him from
escaping the charges of developing a reflection theory of socio-economic
determination, despite his attempts to avoid the latter by acknowledging
and integrating into his conception other sources of determination like
political developments, mythological predecessors, ideological
influences, and ego formation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 12 and 217--30.</d-footnote> To clarify, it is not that these
factors do not play a part in the development of PSM but rather that
acknowledging them without integrating them into a broader functional
conception fails to recognizes the main problem with reflection
theories, which lies in their formalism rather than their limited
breadth, and, in doing so, reproduces that problem. It is to elaborating
such a functional conception and showing how it allows us to bring
together the disparate elements of our exposition up to this point that
we shall turn in the next section.

### The Emergence of Essence (3.3)

In order to avoid the problems that we attributed above to the formalism
of Seaford's approach, we must return to the crisis of aristocracy, and
the series of developing social crises it kicked off and remained
entangled with, and understand PSM in terms of how it functioned as a
response to those crises and their development. In particular, we should
understand it as a response to acute moments of crisis by members of the
aristocracy that had specific functions in relation to their class
position. The acute crisis brought on by rapid monetization after the
introduction of coinage would have brought into sharper focus the
disjunction between the ideological and libidinal constitution of the
aristocratic subject, whose lingering attachment to certain ideas,
values, and forms of activity still corresponded to a significant extent
to a position within older relations of production that no longer
characterized the reality they found themselves in and had to navigate
in order to reproduce themselves both as individuals and as a
class.<d-footnote>This is especially true if we take into account Sartre's points about the importance of childhood and the class situation of the previous generations in ideological formation. See Jean-Paul Sartre, _Search for a Method_, trans. Hazel E. Barnes (Knopf, 1963), 57--65.</d-footnote>

In this light, the conceptual innovations of PSM should be seen as a
part of the broader aristocratic response to the acute developments of
this crisis brought on by the rapid monetization of the social
formations in which they arose. In general, it functioned to refashion
the ideological foundations of the rule, self-conception and general
worldview of the aristocracy in response to the threats posed to them by
crisis---and the role the previous aristocratic ideological forms
continued to play in the development and perpetuation of said crisis.
Earlier, we saw how neither the nostalgic omission characteristic of
Homer's early response to the crisis brought on by commercialization,
nor the anxious denigration of Theognis' response, was able to
adequately orient them to these changing conditions. At the same time,
we saw how the parallel development of commercialization and the crisis
allowed this need for ideological reconfiguration to come out more
clearly in the poems of Theognis---where the emptying out of the
previous value system had already prompted the beginnings of a
reorientation towards new ones---and how this was accompanied by a
reconceptualization of truth that mirrored the (still incomplete)
objectification of the social function of reproducing the
presuppositions of the social formation as a whole. We should understand
the development of Pre-Socratic Monism as a new stage in this
development of the aristocratic response to crisis in which the rapid
and pervasive monetization brought on by the introduction of coinage
(along with the other features of coins mentioned above) allowed the
early philosophers to develop an ideological account that was able to
more adequately respond to the crises they faced.

This functional conception aids our attempt to explain the
socio-historical determination of the concept of essence in a number of
ways. The first is by allowing us to develop a better account of the
reasons for the isomorphism between the determinations of its concept of
substance and the form-determinations of money. In order to more
effectively respond to the social developments facing them, aristocrats
in rapidly monetizing _poleis_, both individually and as a class, needed
to develop a more adequate understanding of their societies. The crisis
had created an unusual situation in which the reproduction of the
exploiting class as a class required not so much a (more or less direct)
reproduction of the ruling ideology, and its forms practice and
"know-how", as a _fundamental transformation of the ruling ideology_ on
the basis of which the exploiting class could refashion its misaligned
and counter-productive forms of practice and "know-how."<d-footnote>This conception of the ruling ideology and its relation to practice and "know-how" draws from Louis Althusser, _On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses_, trans. G.M. Goshgarian (Verso, 2014), 235--6.</d-footnote> So, when
I say they needed to develop a more adequate understanding, I do not
mean this simply in the sense of abstract or instrumental knowledge, but
rather in the sense of a conceptual anchoring point, a reality schema,
on the basis of which they could ensure the effectiveness of this
reorientation.Their societies were increasingly constituted as
interdependent totalities given unity by money as the singular concrete
embodiment of the abstract value of commodities, for which they were
universally exchangeable and in which they expressed their equivalence
and interchangeability with each other. In positing the universe in a
similar fashion, as an ordered impersonal totality in which multiplicity
is given unity by a single universal substance, PSM provided a
conceptual schema that corresponded to the new reality adequately enough
to serve as a foundation for this necessary ideological
realignment.<d-footnote>This does not mean that it was the only schema developed to fulfill such a function, or that it did so perfectly, although the lasting influence of its conceptual innovations attest to its success---at least among certain fractions of the aristocracy.</d-footnote> In this context, we can understand the isomorphism
between its determinations and those of the money form as a consequence
of the ideological demands made upon the aristocracy by the
crisis.<d-footnote>It is important to note that it was not just the internal crisis of aristocracy that necessitated this ideological realignment but also the heightened conditions of class struggle and external social crisis that demanded their reconfiguration as a class.</d-footnote>

Our functional conception also allows us to return to the question we
raised in Section 2.1 about the continuities between the Bardic
conception of truth and the determination of truth in PSM, in which key
elements of the earlier conception persisted despite the objectification
of the social function of the bard, which eliminated the direct
connection between speech and the reproduction of the social
presuppositions of the social totality---a connection on which the truth
of that speech had rested. As I noted above, Theognis' transitional
conception of Truth did not just correspond to the (incomplete)
objectification of the formerly subjective presuppositions, but also to
the attempt to reconfigure aristocratic values and redefine aristocracy
on the basis of those values, however limited that attempt may have
been. This ideological project provides a functional reason for the
retention of the concept of truth among both Theognis and the
pre-socratics, despite the collapse of the social relationships in which
the traditional conception had been embedded.<d-footnote>For the conception of a project used here, see Sartre, _Search for a Method_, 93--100; and Fredric Jameson, _Marxism and Form: Twentieth Century Dialectical Theories of Literature_ (Princeton University Press, 1974), 214--21.</d-footnote> The goal of that
project was to reestablish, to the extent that they could, the position
they had previously enjoyed before the crisis, and in particular before
the usurpation of the tyrants, as well as the general challenging of
their status from below by the broader lower classes connected to this
usurpation. In response to these challenges, they looked back to the
previous fount of aristocratic legitimacy and attempted to adapt it to
the conditions they found themselves in.<d-footnote>This is supported by the explicit incorporation of more anachronistic mythico-religious elements connected to the traditional conception of truth in the presentation of the various pre-socratics, such as the residual mythological elements and aspects of the mystery cults that informed both the form and content of PSM, especially in the works of Heraclitus and Parmenides. See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 217--30 and 231--42; and Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 130--4.</d-footnote> The tension between this
restorative tendency and the adaptive one discussed in the preceding
paragraph goes a long way towards explaining the reasons why the
traditional conception of truth was both partially retained and at the
same time maintained its correspondence with the now objectified social
presupposition of the social formation.

There was a double reciprocality between the subjective project of the
aristocratic proponents of PSM and the objective conditions in which
that project was formulated. On the first level, the objective
conditions determined the needs that the project constituted a response
to and the class situation in which those needs and that response were
situated, while the subjective project determined the specific way in
which those needs would be taken up---i.e. in terms of the inherited
traditions of the aristocratic subjects who formulated and developed
that project and the promise of restoration that they held out. On the
second level, the objective conditions also made it so that the
subjective project could not be formulated along the same lines as it
had been before. The objectification of the reproduction of the social
presuppositions of the social formation as a whole, and the need for a
reality schema on which to base the project of ideological realignment,
meant that the traditional concept of truth had to be reformulated,
while, from the subjective side, the contours of that traditional
conception seem to have determined that reformulation as a reformulation
that retained its connection to the (now objective) social
presuppositions.

To fully understand this last point, we must examine the subjective
reasons for retaining a conception of truth a little more closely. What
was the appeal of a conception of truth for the aristocratic proponents
of PSM? While we cannot say for certain, the most likely reason for this
appeal, and the one that best explains the continued centrality of the
social presuppositions to this conception, is that it has something to
do with the _transcendence_ enabled by the supersensible and atemporal
aspects of truth, which was based on the _social_ transcendence of the
presuppositions of the social formation.<d-footnote>As we saw in Section 3.1, Seaford attributes this social transcendence to the "integrative power" of money, and the way in which it becomes a necessary form of mediation on which the individual and community both depend. This is not necessarily wrong, as both of these are aspects of its role as a presupposition of the social formation as a whole, but it does not fully grasp why that role makes it socially transcendent. As I argued in Section 2.1, it was the place of the cultural presuppositions reproduced by the bard outside of the sensuous activity of the community as conditions of communal production that were not themselves produced by the community that constituted their social transcendence. With money, the situation is similar, although it is produced by the community. The reason why it still functions as a presupposition despite being produced as a part of the communal labor is because of the way that the process of commercialization individualizes social production and posits money as the sole representative of the _sociality_ of labor. In this way, money can be seen as socially transcendent insofar as it stands outside the individual processes of production that constitute the total social labor and, though itself produced, is separated off from the rest of social production as the ground of its determination as _social_ production.</d-footnote> This transcendence
allowed the aristocratic proponents of PSM to eternalize their position
in the relations of exploitation, which was beneficial as a means of
both legitimating the aristocracy as a whole, and of strengthening the
claims of their ideological project in relation to other aristocratic
ideologies that did not invoke the same transcendence (and which likely
represented newer, more commercialized class fractions).<d-footnote>On this last point, see Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 107--10.</d-footnote>

We can see here how the function of legitimating the rule of the
aristocracy, which, in Section 2.1, we separated out in discussing the
social function of the bard in as the less important side in terms of
understanding the determination of truth, actually played a role in the
persistence of that determination after the concrete relations in which
it was embedded dissolved, and of its connection to the social
transcendence of the social presuppositions. Without the direct
connection that existed between bardic speech and the reproduction of
those presuppositions, it was this function of legitimation and its
connection to that transcendence that maintained the overall connection
between truth and the now-objectified presuppositions. At the same time
both the dissolution of that direct connection and the objectification
of those presuppositions meant that truth had to be configured
differently to maintain its general ideological functionality.<d-footnote>For example, the truth of a statement could no longer be seen as attached to the social position of the speaker, but instead had to be understood as independent and objective, and so (in principle) universally accessible, but, at the same time, increasingly contestable and relative insofar as its independence and objectivity separated it from its connection to any specific individual.</d-footnote>

The third way in which our functional conception of PSM helps us is by
allowing us to specify the relationship between the monetary content of
PSM and the aristocratic ideology of self-sufficiency that we discussed
in Section 3.1. This ideology of self-sufficiency, already recognizable
in Homer, increasingly revealed itself to be the bedrock on which the
distinction between aristocrat and non-aristocrat could be made as the
monetary confusions of the crisis were worked out and weaker elements of
the traditional concept of aristocracy, like heredity, fell to the
wayside as the class was reconstituted along the lines set out by the
transforming mode of exploitation and commercialization.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World_, 114--7; Moses Finley, _The World of Odysseus_ (New York Review Books, 2002), 68--70.</d-footnote> In this
sense, it both pre-existed the developments of PSM and had a certain
centrality to the ideological project of the aristocracy as a whole that
exceeded the bounds of the specific project that animated PSM. So, to a
certain extent, Seaford was right to pose it as external to PSM, but, by
understanding it as a supplementary influence that modified and
introduced extraneous content to the money-derived content of PSM, he
did not understand the way in which the two were co-constitutive in the
formulation of PSM and reciprocally determined one another.

Both the reconfiguration of truth according to the determinations of the
money form and the definition of aristocracy in terms of self
sufficiency should be seen as part of the same project of ideological
realignment that represented the subjective moment of the determination
of PSM. The ideology of self-sufficiency centered around an abstract
negation of dependence that allowed the aristocrat to be distinguished
from both the commoner and the slave (and from women, who, even if part
of an aristocratic household, were considered dependent on the male
householder), and made the definition of aristocracy the same as that of
freedom, which as a moral ideal provided both a justification for
aristocratic rule and a normative standard on which individual conduct
could be guided and evaluated, and thereby brought into line with the
continuing reproduction of the mode of exploitation.<d-footnote>This alignment of aristocracy and freedom also played a significant role in bringing the conduct of the democratic _polis_ as a whole into line with the reproduction of the relations of exploitation in so far as political freedom took on the same determinations and thereby shaped the norms and expectations of inter-_polis_ relations and conduct for the citizen body in general.</d-footnote> The
importance of this emphasis on self-sufficiency can be seen not just in
the later developments of a figure like Parmenides, as Seaford
emphasizes, but already in one of the earliest formulations of the
doctrine of PSM, that of Anaximander, whose _apeiron_, aside from taking
on the determinations of money (especially in its function as means of
circulation), is said to have no beginning, and to surround and steer
all things.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 192. Seaford does suggest the possibility of earlier influences of the ideology of self-sufficiency, but only traces it back to Xenophanes, merely raises the possibility without following through on it, and does not see how much of a constitutive role it plays in the overall substance conception of PSM. See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 212 and 248.</d-footnote> This connection of abstract substance with stasis and
independence clearly has something to do with the transcendence of truth
that we discussed above, but its specific form, especially the way in
which the _apeiron_ "steers all things" from its position of static
independence, bears a significant resemblance to the ideology of
self-sufficiency and the aristocratic class position on which it was
based.

If we take a closer look at that class position in relation to the
monetized economy of the _polis_, and the way in which aristocratic
ideology represents a one-sided abstraction that covers over the
contradictions inherent in that relation, this resemblance becomes even
more telling. As the primary owners of the land and slaves through which
the surplus product, on which the whole monetary economy of the polis
was based, was appropriated, the aristocracy did indeed have a certain
foundational independence in relation to that economy. At the same time,
this appearance of independence, which expressed itself in the one-sided
abstraction of the ideology of self-sufficiency, was matched by a
reciprocal dependence on the slaves whose surplus labor supported their
consumption, on the commodified division of labor that was inseparable
from said surplus appropriation, and on the goods (and services) they
received in exchange for the products of the surplus labor they
appropriated, without which they could not have lived as they did.<d-footnote>This one sided appearance of independence was strengthened by the fact that, as owners of agricultural land and slaves to work it, most aristocrats could hypothetically have supported themselves and their households without engaging in exchange, although probably only temporarily and, again, not in the concrete ways in which they actually lived. Furthermore, the goods that supported both the immediate consumption of the aristocracy and the exchange they engaged in had become their property neither as a result of their own labor nor through exchange, so that when they were exchanged (or consumed), they appeared to a certain extent as not just a foundation, but an unproduced foundation, separated both spatially and socially from the process of becoming that gave rise to it. From the perspective we developed above in relation to the social presuppositions of the social formation, it could be said that the ideology of self-sufficiency had its roots in aristocratic control of the other major presuppositions of the social formation, land and slaves, from which it obtained its own transcendence..</d-footnote>
From the perspective of this one-sided self-sufficiency, the aristocracy
could appear as a static, unproduced foundation of the social formation
as a whole, one which steered the whole world of exchange-mediated
activity and covered over the aristocracy's own dependence on both that
world of exchange and the slaves whose labor provided the foundation of
their existence and social position. It was this one-sided abstraction
of the aristocratic position in terms of independence that was
transferred to the abstract substance of PSM and increasingly made
self-sufficiency into one of its core determinations.

This combination of determinations derived from the money form and the
ideology of self-sufficiency (or the contradictory objective situation
that it covered over) were complementary and helped to stabilize each
other. The determination of truth as essence allowed the proponents of
PSM to compensate for the one-sidedness of aristocratic self-sufficiency
by aligning independence with true reality and consigning the side of
aristocratic dependence to the inessential (and, following the absolute
distinction posited by Parmenides, _untrue_) world of becoming. It also
supplemented the ideological function of distinguishing between
aristocrats and non-aristocrats on the basis of self-sufficiency with a
positive account of their right to rule on the basis of intellectual
superiority or access to truth. The determination of self sufficiency,
on the other hand, allowed them to cohere and stabilize the concept of
abstract substance itself in its reflection of the contradiction between
the abstract value and concrete embodiment of money.<d-footnote>This is evidenced by the progressive abstraction of the substance concepts of the pre-socratics (which will be discussed more below), which was accompanied by an increasing prominence of the determination of self-sufficiency. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 244.</d-footnote> It also
counteracted (to some extent) the deprivileging of truth that had
resulted from the objectification of the social function of the bard by
re-establishing a connection between truth and the position of the
aristocrat.<d-footnote>This was also aided by the class position of the aristocracy itself, which both ensured that they were the main people who had the free time necessary for metaphysical inquiry and, by separating them from the immediate process of production, promoted their development of an abstract consciousness suited to those pursuits.</d-footnote> Together, these factors allowed the aristocratic
proponents of PSM to depict themselves as the expositers of an esoteric
(even if _in principle_ universal) doctrine that granted access to true
reality in opposition to the mere appearance of everyday life, but only
for the few whose social position identified them with that truth and
enabled them to reach the heights of abstract intellect needed to
understand that doctrine.

Our functional conception of PSM has already allowed us to develop a
much more concrete conception of the emergence of the concept of essence
in PSM, but there is one crucial question left to be answered in order
to fill out this picture. This is the question of why the determinations
of money took the form of cosmological or metaphysical determinations
about the universe, or why they were displaced from their social context
into the cosmological/metaphysical register. The first likely reason for
this is that despite the innovativeness of their new conception, the
early philosophers still did not produce it from thin air. The thinkers
in the tradition of PSM needed to draw on the ideological resources
present to them in order to refashion them, and these were largely
cosmological and mytho-poetic.<d-footnote>See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 217--30.</d-footnote> As the tradition developed, we can
see a progressive detachment from these origins, what some have referred
to as a secularization, but never a full break.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 89--106 and 130.</d-footnote> The second reason
is that despite needing to develop a conception that allowed them to
orient themselves within the newly and increasingly monetized social
world they lived in, explaining that world, or the mechanisms of its
monetary mediation, was not the primary (implicit or explicit) aim of
their accounts. These accounts responded to the conflict and confusion
caused by the misalignment between aristocratic ideology and its social
conditions, and its primary function should be seen in terms of
refashioning that ideology rather than directly explaining those
conditions. In fact, the latter aim probably wouldn't have been a
legible project given the ideological foundations that served as their
starting point---although it would become one for a figure like
Aristotle, but only after the ideological and philosophical changes that
PSM inaugurated had developed and entrenched themselves. The third, and
most significant, reason brings us back to the critique of Seaford's
unconscious cosmological projection that I made above. I mentioned there
that Seaford's use of the psychological concepts of projection and the
unconscious ignored the psychoanalytic specification of these mechanisms
in terms of a negative reaction to some content that is unable to be
recognized. From this perspective, we can see the displacement of the
determinations of money from their social context into the realm of pure
thought as a response to some aspect(s) of the social content of the
former that they were unable (or unwilling) to recognize, or, to put it
in more Jamesonian language, we can see it as an imaginary solution to
the real contradiction between money or monetization and their own class
position and ideological project.<d-footnote>Jameson, _The Political Unconscious_, 79.</d-footnote>

The primary contradiction that motivated this displacement was between
the equality of abstract human labor, which is posited by the money
form, and the relations of exploitation that determined the class
position of the aristocracy, which posited an inequality between the
labor of slaves and that of free men. Marx himself notes this as an
explanation for Aristotle's inability to develop a concept of value in
the first chapter of _Capital._ He says that "Aristotle himself was
unable to extract this fact, that, in the form of commodity values, all
labor is expressed as equal human labor and therefore as labor of equal
quality, by inspection from the form of value, because Greek society was
founded on the labor of slaves, hence had as its natural basis the
inequality of men and of their labor-powers."<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 151--2. Although it is clear that Aristotle was able to turn the concept of essence back on the original context from which its primary determinations originated, it is also clear that this is a secondary application of the primarily metaphysical concept, and therefore still dependent on the distancing effected by the original displacement, and also that he was still unable to directly apply it to the analysis of value or money itself, whose essence he cannot identify, leading him to declare it inessential and untrue.</d-footnote> If we take the
class-situated demand for ideological realignment made by the crisis and
the objectification of the social function of the bard as the positive
grounds of the functionally-determined taking up of the money form by
PSM, then we can take this contradiction between the equality posited by
money and the inequality posited by slavery (which has its roots in the
same conditions that produced the crisis and its demands) as the
negative ground that determined that taking up as a displacement into
the cosmological/metaphysical register. We can also see how the
ideological project itself further determined the inability to take up
this contradiction, which would have stood in opposition to its aim of
legitimizing the position of the aristocracy in the relations of
exploitation.

There is another way in which this equality posited by the money-form
may have served as a negative ground of the development of PSM. In order
to posit the equality of different concrete labors, money must
simultaneously posit them as homogenous fractions of the total social
labor. In exchanging their products for money, the owners of those
products posit the labor that went into them as as equal not to a
specific other kind of labor, but rather to all other kinds of labor
that have their equivalent in money, and this is what allows the value
of the different products of those labors to appear "as values of
quantitatively comparable magnitude."<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 159.</d-footnote> In doing so, those owners
posit their labor in relation to the sum total of the labor in their
society, but in an externalized form, as a relation between objects,
rather than as a relation between people.<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 164.</d-footnote> At the same time, the
process of commercialization that gives rise to money increases the
division of labor and in doing so it also increases the degree of
interdependence between the producers, integrating previously
independent branches of production, and communities, into the unified
division of labor of a broader social formation.<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 471-2.</d-footnote> This means that
money, along with the commercialization process that it represents the
formal culmination of, makes a number of independent communities into an
interdependent social totality in a new and more comprehensive way,
turns the implicit and subjective unity of those communities (in which
which the primary processes of production had, for the most part, been
conducted on the basis of the independent household with the function of
reproducing that household) into an explicit and objective one, and, at
the same time, obscures the social character and interdependence of the
various labor processes which it brings into relation and thereby
constitutes as fractions of the total social labor, and does so exactly
insofar as it enacts that objectification.<d-footnote>Contra Marx, I think that the way in which the commodity and money forms constitute labor as a fraction of a social whole should also be understood as the basis of the qualitative equality of the different labors objectified in the process of exchange. Marx's proposal, that it is their physiological equality insofar as they are expenditures of human muscles, nerves, etc. that forms the basis of their commensurability as quantities of abstract labor, relies on something external to the commodity form to explain the equalization posited by it. While this remains a possibility, it seems more likely to me that the equalization posited by the commodity form has its basis in an aspect of that form itself rather than in an external abstraction, the concrete derivation of which from the act of exchange seems unclear. Exchange itself, and especially monetary exchange, posits the different labors as social at the same time as it posits them as equal, so it seems reasonable to look for the basis of their equality in the sociality posited along with it. In fact, as we saw above, the quantitative comparability of commodities (in which their equality is expressed) is itself based on their exchangeability not with each other directly, but with the embodiment of abstract social labor. This allows us to identify the equality between the labor embodied in exchanged commodities and the quantitative determination of their value as labor _time_ as both having their origin in the way in which exchange posits the different labors as a fraction of the total social labor, with the former deriving from the socialization it effects and the latter from the externalization. It also suggests a possible basis in the commodity form itself for the persistent reappearance of assertions of the inequality of human beings under capitalism, in the form of theoretical and practical racism, despite the tendency to acknowledge the realization of formal equality on the basis of the wage relation. On this account of the origins of equalization, that persistent tendency to racialization could be understood as having its basis in the commodity form insofar as 1) the necessarily nation-state-based organization of capitalist social formations whose economic self-identity is expressed in the differential exchange rates between different national currencies keeps the world broken up into a multiplicity of separate social totalities, which provides a material basis for denying the extension of the principle of formal equality beyond the bounds of the national community (and the derivative ideological expansion of this denial to include members of the racist's nation who can be imaginatively identified as foreign), and 2) the continuing inability to recognize the social content of the commodity form due to the externalized form of social totality posited by the commodity, and the fetishism resulting from it, also undermines the recognition of equality by obscuring its origins and contributing to its ideological slipperiness insofar as it provides a basis for its continuing determination as abstract, merely formal equality. On the national organization of capitalist social formations and the exchange rates between national currencies, see John Milios and Dimitris P. Sotiropoulos, _Rethinking Imperialism: A Study of Capitalist Rule_ (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), 105--8 and 154--9.</d-footnote> As we saw above, the
ideology of self-sufficiency was based in the one-sided abstraction away
from the interdependent side of this contradiction, and so recognizing
this sociality would have further prevented PSM from fulfilling its
function insofar as it undermined the functionality of that ideology.

This explanation of the displacement also allows us to understand the
process of progressive abstraction that we discussed above, in which the
attempt to identify the nature of the underlying substance moved from
candidates that resembled the concrete use-value of money to candidates
that resembled its abstract value.<d-footnote>See Section 3.1.</d-footnote> Now, we can see how the
contours of that development, as well as the confusion that prompted it,
were results of this negative ground of the displacement of the money
form. It was the way in which this displacement and its grounds (along
with the inherent fetishism of the money form) obscured the _actual
substance_ of value---abstract labor---that determined the form of PSM
as a identificatory search and determined the poles within which the
development took place. It was because this actual substance was
inaccessible that the concept of substance arose in the form of a
question as to the identity of that substance, and that the contours of
the development took place between the contradictory poles of that
substance's form of appearance, the relation between which cannot be
reconciled without a notion of that substance itself.

This absence created an instability in the conceptual content of the
early formulations of PSM in which it oscillated between the poles of
the contradiction, and it was the determination of self sufficiency that
helped stabilize this oscillation by driving the process of progressive
abstraction noted by Seaford. As PSM developed, there was a simultaneous
increase in the prominence of self sufficiency in the substance concepts
of its proponents and in the abstraction of that concept as it moved
from a greater resemblance to concrete money toward one to abstract
value, until, with Parmenides concept of abstract Being, the
determinations of truth became completely identified with determinations
of self-subsistent abstract value.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 244.</d-footnote> This is not necessarily to say
that Parmenides' conception more adequately reflects the substance of
value, which, though abstract, is the result of a process of mediation
that it cannot be separated from (which probably makes it more akin to
Heraclitus' conception and its "reversible exchange"), but rather that
in it the one-sided abstraction of value and the one-sided abstraction
of self-sufficiency developed into a relatively stable form in which
each covered over the defects of the other---thus bringing to a close
the first first phase of the development of the concept of essence in
Ancient Greece in which the question of substance, of identifying the
_arche_, was primary.<d-footnote>For a discussion of "reversible exchange" in Heraclitus, see Chris Kassam, "Heraclitus, Seaford and Reversible Exchange," _The Journal of Speculative Philosophy_ 31, no. 4 (2017): 609--33, <https://doi.org/10.5325/jspecphil.31.4.0609>. I think that Kassam overemphasizes the extent to which the reversibility of exchange in Heraclitus negates the increased level of abstraction that Seaford identifies there. It seems clear to me that Heraclitus posits substance as the inseparable unity of both the abstract self-subsistence of the one and the concrete becoming of the many, while at the same time privileging the one as the underlying moment and ground of the truth of the movement. My favorite example of this is D50 (B54), which Laks and Most translate as "Invisible fitting-together (_harmoniê_), stronger than a visible one." Besides already asserting the precedence of invisible harmony, and so the abstract moment, in terms of its content, this fragment also enacts it formally. The greek text is structured as two pairs of oppositions, an inner opposition between _aphanēs_ (invisible) and _phanerēs_ (visible), which itself has a visible harmony in terms of its morphology, and an outer opposition between _harmoniê_ (fitting-together/harmony) and _kreíttōn_ (stronger), the latter of which originally meant superiority granted to the warrior-aristocrat by the gods and was connected to the idea of domination and came to have a distinct physical/martial sense compared to the other comparative forms that were used to mean 'better.' This seems to be an unreconciled contradiction both visibly and in terms of meaning, but, in the context of the sentence, there is an invisible harmony insofar as the outer terms both determine the relationship between the terms of the inner opposition, with the first providing a substrate of sorts for the meaning of visible and invisible (as both referring to harmonies) and the second providing the structure of their relation. Thus, the outer terms not only create an invisible harmony between the inner terms but also reconcile their own opposition through that act of providing invisible harmony to the inner opposition. It is this invisible harmony that establishes the harmony of the fragment as a whole, that reconciles the opposition between form and content and into which it had divided itself.

Now that our account of the emergence and development of the concept of
essence in this first phase is drawing to a close, I will summarize the
conclusions that can be drawn from what has been said in this
section.The emergence of the concept of abstract substance should be
understood as a functional response to the crisis caused by the
reciprocal development of commercialization and the centralization of
slavery in the relations of production. This crisis, and the
misalignment it caused between the ideological constitution of the
aristocracy and objective conditions they found themselves in, created a
demand for fundamental ideological realignment that the Pre-Socratic
Monists attempted to meet. To do so, they took up and adapted the
traditional conception of truth as a means of both reasserting the
legitimacy which it had conferred upon their predecessors and providing
a reality schema on the basis of which the required reorientation could
be grounded. This meant reconfiguring that conception on the basis of
the determinations of money, which had taken the place of the customary
and cultural traditions reproduced by the bard as the social
presupposition of the social totality. At the same time, the
contradiction between the substance of value and the position of the
aristocracy required the determinations of money to be taken up in a
disguised form in order to retain their functional value, displacing
them into the cosmological/metaphysical register. But, this
reconfiguration of truth on the basis of the displaced form
determinations of money could not fulfill the ideological function
demanded of it by the crisis on its own. It both required
supplementation from, and helped cover over the one-sidedness of, the
pre-existing and developing aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency,
which provided a basic definition of the aristocrat on the basis of
their place in the relations of exploitation, helped stabilize the
conceptual confusion caused by the displacement of money, and determined
the development of the concept of substance towards increasing
abstraction and correspondence with abstract value rather than its
concrete embodiment in money.

## 4. Conclusion

### Methodological Conclusions (4.1)

At the beginning of this piece, I said that in it I would focus on
laying the groundwork for a larger project with two aims: providing a
historical materialist account of the origins and development of the
concept of essence and developing a Marxist theory of essence that
facilitates the project of revolutionary praxis in the present. It is
now time to evaluate our progress on these fronts, although, due to the
preliminary nature of our investigation, what we will be able to say
about the latter will necessarily be more abstract and provisional than
what we can say about the former.

The contribution made by this piece with respect to the first aim can be
broken up into two categories. The first is the confirmation and
development of certain theoretical and methodological principles and the
second is the provision of a baseline understanding of the emergence of
the concept of essence itself in the Greek context. In terms of
methodology, the main principles whose fruitfulness I believe has been
shown in the course of our investigation, and which I would like to
highlight here are:

1.  Any explanation of the socio-historical determination of the concept
    of essence must be grounded in a reconstruction of the concrete
    historical material corresponding to particular social formations
    rather than transhistorical determinations or teleological schemas
    that determine that material retrospectively.

2.  Such a reconstruction must itself have its basis in the mode of
    production and its transformations considered as a total social
    process in which relatively independent spheres and elements
    reciprocally condition one another in an asymmetrical fashion that
    gives priority to the broadly economic base.<d-footnote>See Appendix 1 for a more in depth examination of this principle.</d-footnote>

3.  Attention must be paid to uneven character of such a process, and
    especially to the lag between the ideological and subjective
    elements and the economic base, such as we saw in the case of the
    misalignment between the ideological constitution of the
    aristocratic subject and the demands imposed upon them by their
    changing position in the class structure of their social formations.

4.  The identification of a homology between conceptual or ideological
    elements and economic or more broadly social ones can serve as a
    starting point for investigation and indicator of a connection
    between those elements and their conditions of possibility, but this
    identification must be surpassed to offer a proper explanation.

5.  A key element of any such explanation is a functional account of the
    taking up of certain of the objective contents of such a homology
    into thought.

6.  Such a functional account should involve the two moments of
    class-situated _response_ to the objective situation and subjective
    project oriented towards intervening in class struggle--and so
    acting on the objective conditions that solicited the response.

Principles 4--6 in particular represent the methodological _results_ of
the investigation undertaken here, and though they remain open to
revision or qualification on the basis of further study, I believe that
they provide a strong foundation upon which to conduct such study. One
way of viewing such a contribution is as an extension of the Hegelian
determination of the concept as purposive activity that takes up and
transforms its external conditions, and its Marxist reformulation in
terms of labor, to the question of the socio-historical determination of
philosophy.<d-footnote>For the Hegelian conception of the concept, see Karen Ng, "From Actuality to the Concept in Hegel's Logic" in _The Oxford Handbook of Hegel_, ed. Dean Moyar (Oxford University Press, 2017). For the Marxist conception, see Marx, _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1884_, 75. See also Appendix 1.</d-footnote> From this perspective, we could generalize them into
the principle that _the determination of thought by its objective
conditions always involves activity on the part of individuals according
to their subjective purposes in relation to those conditions._

### Historical Conclusions (4.2)

On the side of the historical content of the emergence and development
of the concept of essence, the conclusions outlined at the end of
Section 3.3 provide us with a starting point for constructing a broader
narrative of that development up to the present. At the same time, we
cannot assume a continuity in either the content or function of the
concept of essence after this first phase, and so that construction
would require a renewed effort of historical reconstruction of the
development of both the concept itself and the conditions in which it
developed. It is very possible that its persistence and development, if
these can be established, resulted from its taking on different
functions for different individuals and class fractions in different
periods and circumstances. There is also a need for examining other
regions like India and China in which a concept of essence seemed to
emerge independently around the same time and incorporating those
developments into our overall narrative.<d-footnote>Seaford's _The Origins of Philosophy in Ancient Greece and Ancient China_ could provide a good starting point for this work.</d-footnote> Additionally, it seems
likely that in attempting to track the further development of the
concept of essence after its emergence, further attention would need to
be paid to the relative autonomy of philosophical development as it
matures and becomes institutionalized. Still, the above account of the
relationship between money and the concept of essence suggests a few
candidates for explaining the apparent persistence of that concept under
different modes of production and concrete circumstances that seem like
fruitful areas for further investigation.

The first is the connection between the reconfiguration of truth and the
emergence of essence. Since it was the monetized objectification of the
social presuppositions that determined the contours of the
reconfiguration of truth at the heart of the emergence of the concept of
essence, this also seems like a good place to look in terms of
generating research questions on the basis of which to investigate the
persistence of that concept. Is there a persistent connection between
the determinations of essence and the role of money as a preposition of
social production? Or between essence (or truth) and the general
presuppositions regardless of whether or not these are monetary? Or, is
this just a condition of their emergence that ceases to play a role in
their persistence as time goes on? What happens when capital takes up
both the monetary and non-monetary presuppositions into its own process
of realization? Similarly, it seems like the negative conditioning of
that emergence due to the inability to recognize the substance of value
raises a similar set of questions. In particular, the question of
whether the persistence of the displacement at the core of the emergence
of the concept of essence has its basis in a continuing inability to
recognize the equality and interdependence of human labor seems
fruitful, and I have already given some provisional indications of how
this continuity might manifest itself under capitalist relations of
production in note 126. These are just two possible avenues of inquiry
suggested by the project undertaken above, but I think they already
provide a more promising basis for developing a concrete account of the
history of the concept of essence than those currently available.

### Practical Conclusions (4.3)

There is a significant historical distance between the object of my
investigation here and revolutionary practice in the present day that
makes it harder to evaluate its practical significance, so all of the
following will have an even more provisional and suggestive character
than even the historical conclusions discussed above. Still, I think
elements of the research conducted here can help direct our attention in
some pertinent directions in terms of developing a marxist concept of
essence adequate to the task of facilitating contemporary revolutionary
praxis. Before getting into this, I think it is important to point out
that my research has led me to rethink Marcuse's assumption that truth
is a subordinate determination of the concept of essence, and to
recognize that it was rather essence that appeared to be a form of the
concept of truth, a reconfiguration of it on the basis of changing
material conditions and ideological imperatives. It will take further
research to determine how this relationship continued to be reconfigured
over time, so, for now I will speak of the concept of essence with the
understanding that it may in fact be the concept of truth in general
that I'm attempting to refer to.

The first practical consideration I want to discuss has to do with the
points made in section 3.3 about the function of essence as both a
reality schema used to ground practic-ideological reorientation and as a
means of legitimation of the place of the ruling class in the mode of
exploitation. On the one hand, I think that the connection between
essence and legitimation calls into question its usefulness for a
revolutionary project, in which case it might only be the critique of
the concept of essence that is useful to us---insofar as it provides us
with a means of dispelling the connection between reality indexing and
legitimation propagated by that concept. On the other hand, any
revolutionary project itself needs a means of effecting
practico-ideological reorientation on the basis of current realities,
and this might be one of the ways in which a Marxist concept of essence
would be valuable, although it would require disentangling these two
functions in such a way that its reality schema could be based not on
the reproduction of the current relations of production but instead on
their overthrow. How to do this, and whether we need to, remain open
questions, but I think the research undertaken here has provided a
useful basis for beginning to think these questions through.

The second practical consideration relates to the negative grounds
discussed near the end of section 3.3 and to Marcuse's assertion of a
relation between essence and freedom. I hope that my overall argument
has served to dispel the notion that the concept of essence has any
positive connection to any substantive idea of freedom that is not
premised on exploitation. At the same time, I do think that the role of
the negative grounds of an inability to recognize the equality and
interdependence posited by the money form could indicate a negative and
indirect relationship between the concept of essence and freedom,
although this would require more historical work to verify. If the
inability to recognize this content and/or opposition to the
implications of its realization continued to provide a foundation for
the maintenance of the projected determinations of money as metaphysical
determinations in the concept of essence, then we should see this
content as the continually returning repressed content that haunts
thought throughout the history of philosophy, and the concept of essence
as preserving the possibility of the realization of equality and
interdependence in a negative manner, as that which cannot be realized
in order for it to continue to function conceptually. We could also see
this as part of the reason why the concept of essence is able to
function as a reality schema for monetized social totality, which itself
relies on the non-realization of substantive equality and direct
interdependence in order to continue to exist as self-externalized
social totality. Ultimately, freedom, in its adequate form as collective
self-determination, is derivative of these latter determinations insofar
as it is premised on the absence of exploitation and the directly
collective self-determination of social production and reproduction,
without which the possibility of purposive control of the production
apparatus and the free mediation of the relationship between human
beings and nature according to consciously determined purposes are
impossible. Whether we determine that it is solely the critique of the
concept of essence or also its reformulation that facilitates
revolutionary practice today, we should take this primacy of equality
and interdependence into account and orient ourselves more towards them
than towards the freedom that would follow from them, or, in other
words, we should orient ourselves towards freedom only insofar as it is
seen as a product of the instantiation of substantive equality and
collective mediation of our interdependent social production.
