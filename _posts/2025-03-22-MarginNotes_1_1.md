The CTWG is a voluntary collective of researchers united by the
recognition that recovering the radical, forgotten core of early
critical theory coincides with renewing the singular effort of early
critical theorists to comprehend our common predicament in the course of
its reiteration---the reasserted social domination of capital covered in
the vanishing alternation of liberal apologetic and fascist enforcement.
Moreover, that the radicality of their work is validated in their
apprehension it would be forgotten in the same dynamic stasis (*Sempre
erranti e sempre qui!*)<d-footnote>Horkheimer: "The individual no longer has a personal history. Though everything changes, nothing moves. He needs neither a Zeno nor a Cocteau, neither an Eleatic dialectician nor a Parisian surrealist, to tell what the Queen in *Through the Looking Glass* means when she says, 'It takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place, or what Lombroso's madman expressed in his beautiful poem: *Noi confitti al nostro orgoglio / Come ruote in ferrei perni, / Ci stanchiamo in giri eterni, / Sempre erranti e sempre qui!*'' *Eclipse of Reason*. (Bloomsbury, 2013), 112.</d-footnote> which would re-engender the very need that
first engendered it. To the extent early critical theory seems to us to
have a tragic character, this does not derive from the fact it has
largely been forgotten, but from the fact it is still needed at all. For
us, as for the early critical theorists themselves, the enduring
validity of the critical theory of society, of its critical diagnostic
of capitalist society and its social theorists, is a bitter confirmation
that its dream is still unrealized. Critical Theory is only right in a
wrong world.

Following recent scholarship on the origin and formation of critical
theory (a period stretching from the late 1910s through the early 1940s,
though we focus on the 1930s), our recovery takes its point of
orientation from the intersection of two premises. First, early critical
theory was---and can only be adequately understood and evaluated as---a
development and extension of the Marxian critique of political economy,
which inherited the impulses of dissident (and particularly councilist)
communism. Second, the traditional, and still predominant, reception of
early critical theory has not interpreted it as such given, on the one
hand, the popular context, intellectual and political, in which it has
been received since the student movements of the late 60s,<d-footnote>Cf. Chris O'Kane. "On Frankfurt School Critical Theory and Political Economy." JHI Blog, January 10, 2024. <https://www.jhiblog.org/2024/01/10/on-frankfurt-school-critical-theory-and-political-economy/></d-footnote> and, on
the other, the neglect in academic scholarship of the esoteric form of
writing consciously cultivated by early critical theorists.<d-footnote>Eva-Maria Ziege, *Antisemitismus und Gesellschaftstheorie. Die Frankfurter Schule im amerikanischen Exil.* (Suhrkamp Verlag, 2009), 42-43; Gunzelin Schmid Noerr and Eva-Maria Ziege, "70 Jahre Dialektik der Aufklärung," in *Zur Kritik der regressiven Vernunft*, ed. Noerr & Ziege (Springer VS, Wiesbaden, 2019) 10-11.</d-footnote>

This esoteric form of early critical theory is configured by three
elements: tactical self-censorship, esoteric technique, and the negative
method of presentation required by the dialectical conception of the
critique of political economy. To a much larger degree than has been
appreciated, their esotericism can be explained by 'tactical'
considerations of the benefits of implementing self-censorship protocols
in the hostile, anti-communist conditions of their theoretical
production in exile, as is especially evident from their correspondence.
However, as an esoteric *technique*, it was more than a tactic. It was
an expression of the refusal to capitulate in thought to those
compromises required of them in fact.

In a particularly revealing letter to Horkheimer in late 1941, Adorno
makes a 'tactical' recommendation to remove an explicit reference to
Marx from a draft of an essay to appear in the ISR's journal, providing
three reasons: "Those in-the-know know it anyway, the others need not
notice, and it should annoy Grossmann."<d-footnote>Adorno to Horkheimer, 8/18/1941. *Max Horkheimer, Gesammelte Schriften, Volume 17*. (Hereafter: MHGS Vol. #). Edited by Gunzelin Schmid Noerr and Alfred Schmidt. (1996), 134. Author's translation.</d-footnote> Eva-Maria Ziege has called
it "an esoteric form of communication,"<d-footnote>Eva-Maria Ziege, "The Irrationality of the Rational. The Frankfurt School and Its Theory of Society in the 1940s" in *Antisemitism and the Constitution of Sociology*, ed. Marcel Stoetzler (University of Nebraska Press, 2014), 275-276.</d-footnote> one meant not only to help
the early critical theorists avoid potential political persecution but
also to enable them to continue their collective work on what they often
referred to simply as "the theory"<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Jews and Europe" [1939], translation by Mark Ritter. *Critical Theory and Society: A Reader.* Ed. Stephen Eric Bronner & Douglas Mackay Kellner (Routledge, 1989), 77-78</d-footnote>---and "*there is only one
theory.*"

> theory.<d-footnote>Horkheimer [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12.* (1985), 523-524. Author's translation.</d-footnote>

In addition to implementing protocols of tactical self-censorship under
pressure and elaborating an esoteric technique in protest, the early
critical theorists insist on a negative method of presentation derived
from the conception of the *critique* inherent to the critique of
political economy itself: "Marxist science constitutes the critique of
bourgeois economy and not the expounding of a socialist one."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Authoritarian State" [1942], Trans. Peoples Translation Service in Berkeley and Elliott Eisenberg. *Telos* Spring 1973, No. 15 (1973); doi:10.3817/0373015003, 13.</d-footnote>
Rather, "Marx (\...) wrests from bourgeois society the standard of
legitimacy it fashions for itself, shows it cannot fulfill this, and, at
the same time, maintains such a standard as a negative expression of the
right society," the realization of which "would abolish this form of
society itself."<d-footnote>Adorno and Horkheimer [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 438. Author's translation.</d-footnote> Later, in *Dialectic of Enlightenment* (1947),
they give their pithiest formulation of this orientation, inverting
Spinoza and Hegel: *the false is the index of itself and the true*.<d-footnote>*Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments*. Ed. Gunzelin Schmid Noerr, Trans. Edmund Jephcott (SUP, 2002), 31.</d-footnote>

What they term "the critical irony of Marxian conceptuality"<d-footnote>"The Marxian method and its applicability to the analysis of the present crisis. Seminar Discussion (1936)," *MHGS Vol 12*. (1985), 402. Author's translation.</d-footnote> lies
in the dialectical gesture of learning dialectic from the immanent
contradiction of capitalist society, by virtue of which it secures its
own reproduction through crisis, to *meet guile with double guile*,<d-footnote>Paul Ricoeur, *Freud and Philosophy: An Essay in Interpretation*. Translated by Denis Savage (Yale University Press, 1970), 34.</d-footnote>
to turn its own cunning against it with a "naivete" that preserves "an
element of childhood, the courage to be weak that gives the child the
idea that it will ultimately overcome even what is most difficult."<d-footnote>Adorno, *Hegel: Three Studies* (MIT Press, 1993), 42-43.</d-footnote>
Horkheimer calls this the 'logical structure of the critique of
political economy' in Marx's *Capital*, in which the dialectical
necessity of deductions within the self-referential context of the logic
of the commodity in theory mirrors the processual necessity of the
self-contradictory totality of capitalist society itself; however, in
the course of this presentation, the truly dialectical reversal is
prepared, through which this dialectically self-necessitating totality
is denied its absoluteness in the practice of human self-emancipation.

Horkheimer suggests in a 1939 conversation with Adorno that the trick is
neither believing in happiness when faced with the "objective despair"
of the present nor relinquishing the anobjective claim on a happy
future, to which Adorno responds: "We must be much more naive
\[*naiver*\] and much more unnaive \[*unnaiver*\] at the same
time."<d-footnote>Adorno [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 509-510. Author's translation.</d-footnote>

Yet, because critical theory *does not dogmatically anticipate the
world, but finds the new world through the criticism of the old
one*,<d-footnote>Horkheimer says these lines of Marx could serve as a "motto" for his essays of the 1930s. Letter to Hans Mayer (12/17/1937) in *Life in Letters.* Ed. Jacobson & R. Jacobson (2007), 121-124. For the full exchange with Mayer, see *MHGS Vol. 16* (1995b), 297-305; 333-337.</d-footnote> it has "no secret doctrine" (Adorno);<d-footnote>Adorno [1939]: "On the other hand, I have no secret doctrine either. I believe, however, that the kind of view I have is such that it finds the reflexion in things of the very source of light which cannot be the object of intentions and thoughts." *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 506. Author's translation.</d-footnote> its indirect,
dialectical method of presentation is "one of rational
self-identification" which holds out for true agreement with the
addressee who makes it to the end (*the truth is in the whole, but that
whole is untrue*), and is therefore "by no means an esoteric one"
(Horkheimer).<d-footnote>Horkheimer [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 477. Author's translation.</d-footnote> Adorno and Horkheimer (1939) go so far as to refer to
the *Communist Manifesto* as a stylistic model, as it demonstrates that
"\[i\]n theory, everything has to be equally close to the center."<d-footnote>Adorno [1939] *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 509. Author's translation.</d-footnote>
Each sentence of the *Manifesto* presents the reader with a formative
experience of their own, something everyone has already thought for
themselves, but in such a way as to "penetrate the facade" over the
world, the "fog" of complications and the false "opacity" that serve as
"a veil to cover up the simplicity of it all," which makes the world
seem "incomprehensible" to those who comprise it.<d-footnote>Adorno and Horkheimer [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 512-513. Author's translation.</d-footnote> In his
pseudonymous *Dämmerung* (1934), Horkheimer distills the essence of
their technique: "Language must therefore be prevented from creating the
illusion of a community that does not exist in class society," but "has
to be used as a means in the struggle for a united world" and "today,
the words of the fighters and martyrs of that struggle seem to be coming
from that world."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Urbanity of Language," *Dawn & Decline*. Trans. Michael Shaw. (Continuum: Seabury Press, 1978), 75-76.</d-footnote> The anti-esoteric esotericism of early critical

of fidelity to the vulnerable possibility of "the society we imagine as
unfolded reason."<d-footnote>Horkheimer to Adolph Lowe, 1/4/1938. *MHGS Vol. 16* (1995), 355-356. Author's translation.</d-footnote>

Throughout the archive of posthumously published writings, the "concept
of reason" that early critical theory seeks to realize is given an
unambiguous determination: "Classless society in the critical
sense."<d-footnote>Adorno and Horkheimer [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 514. Author's translation.</d-footnote> However, already in the original publication of
"Traditional and Critical Theory" (1937) in the *Zeitschrift für
Sozialforschung*, Horkheimer defines the idea of critical theory as such
through a negative formulation of the communist program:

> Critical theory, despite the clarity it may have into the individual
> steps of social transformation and the agreement of its elements with
> those of the most advanced traditional theories, has no authority of
> its own except the concern for the abolition of class domination
> \[*Interesse an der Aufhebung der Klassenherrschaft*\] connected with
> it.<d-footnote>"Traditionelle und kritische Theorie". ZfS vol. 6, no. 2, pages 245-294,(1937), 291-292. Author's translation. The extant English translation in *Critical Theory* (2002) is based on the revision of the essay under Horkheimer's direction for the republication of a selection of his early essays in German in 1968, which substitutes "*gesellschaftliche* *Unrecht*" [social injustice] for "*Klassenherrschaft*" [class domination].</d-footnote>

As Christian Voller has recently demonstrated, even under self-imposed
censorship protocols, the description of a "rationally organized
society" which constitutes the normative horizon of the most circumspect
early critical theorists---Adorno and Horkheimer in particular---is
drawn almost verbatim from a single passage in Marx and Engels' *The
German Ideology*.<d-footnote>Christian Voller, *In der Dämmerung*. *Studien zu Vor- und Frühgeschichte der Kritische Theorie* (Matthes & Seitz, 2023), 61-63.</d-footnote>

> Communism differs from all previous movements in that it overturns the
> basis of all earlier relations of production and intercourse, and for

> individuals.<d-footnote>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. *Vol. 5 of Collected Works*. (Lawrence & Wishart, 1976), 81.</d-footnote>

This idea of a "rationally organized society," Horkheimer explains in a
letter of 1938, "coincides with that of the association of free human
beings," and this "coincidence of which we speak is brought about by the
socialization of the means of production and the abolition of classes
and is ever-renewed by the active participation of individuals in
administration."<d-footnote>Horkheimer to Adolph Lowe, (1/4/1938). *MHGS Vol. 16* (1995), 353-354. Author's translation.</d-footnote> Through the late 1940s, their critical criterion
is furnished by "the ideal of social self-administration of the
productive forces in the mode of a universalized republic of
councils."<d-footnote>Voller traces Adorno's "Theses on Need" [1942] back to the theoretical-political problematic elaborated in the works of Karl Korsch. *Dämmerung* (2023), 140-142.</d-footnote> Not even *Dialectic of Enlightenment* (1947) is an
exception:

> \[W\]ith the revolutionary avant-garde, the utopia which proclaimed
> the reconciliation between nature and the self emerged from its hiding
> place in German philosophy as something at once irrational and
> rational, as the idea of the association of free individuals---and
> brought down on itself the full fury of reason.<d-footnote>Adorno and Horkheimer, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*. Trans. Jephcott & ed. Noerr (2007), 71.</d-footnote>

This is most explicit in essays such as Adorno's "Theses on Need" (1942)
and Horkheimer's "Authoritarian State" (1942), in which 'the democracy
of the councils' is presented as the completion of socialist
construction or 'socialization' suppressed (but possibly latent) in
state socialism, as the measure of the betrayal of democracy under the
formal equality of liberal principles in crisis-prone capitalist
societies, and as the antithesis of fascist nationalization that
re-privatizes public functions in the hands of warring cliques which vie
to be the dominant particularity of a universal state.<d-footnote>Adorno, "Theses on Need" [1942], Translation by David Fernbach. *New Left Review 128* (2021): 79-82. Horkheimer, "Authoritarian State" [1942], *Telos* (1973), 8-10. Horkheimer, "The Jews and Europe" [1939], 78, 85-86.</d-footnote> There is an
invariant program at the foundation of early critical theory:

> The theoretical conception which, following its first trailblazers,
> will show the new society its way---the system of workers'
> councils---grows out of praxis. The roots of the council system go
> back to 1871, 1905, and other events. Revolutionary transformation has
> a tradition that must continue.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Authoritarian State" [1942], *Telos* (1973), 10.</d-footnote>

The "obstinacy" with which the critical theorist smashes the fetishes
which occlude its realization of "the association of free human beings
in which each has the same possibility of self-development" and sifts
through the *caput mortuum* of modern humanity for traces of its
possibility is what gives early critical theory its fragility, its
"common bond" with "fantasy."<d-footnote>Horkheimer. "Traditional and Critical Theory" [1937]. *Critical Theory* (2002), 219-220. Translation modified.</d-footnote> The universalized republic of
councils is the contested possibility of mediation between universal and
particular interest, the telos of any truly revolutionary
internationalism, the emancipation of humanity and nature from the
compulsions of capital accumulation through which humanity might be
realized for the first time, and the concretion of self-enlightening of
enlightenment.

> With the thoroughgoing organization of humanity towards a common plan,
> alienation ends, because no one confronts it as alien anymore. The
> process is completed when the universal plan is no longer forced upon
> the individual by external violence, even if that plan is
> ideologically disguised as ones own. (\...) This was Marxist reason,
> the free association of humanity, free from the unplanned effects of
> social power. Only then, when each in their conduct becomes a means of
> the whole, do they also become an end to the whole and to themselves.
> Once the means is fully recognized as an end, we are freed from the
> domination of means. (\...) The only rescue for thinking tired of the

> true that enlightenment is at an end.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Magic of the Concept" (1949). *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 323-325. Author's translation</d-footnote>

The modest contribution of early critical theory consists in providing a
model for the exploration and comprehension of, as a fellow traveler
will later express it, "the aporia intrinsic to socialist activity
between the daily struggle and the goal beyond the limits of that
struggle, which therefore cannot secure itself in advance."<d-footnote>Gillian Rose, *The Broken Middle: Out of Our Ancient Society*. (Blackwell, 1992), 205-206. Cf., Rose *Mourning Becomes the Law: Philosophy and Representation* (Cambridge University Press, 1996), 7-8.</d-footnote> The
problem is one of true revolution---total revolution---for any movement
seeking to overturn capitalist society that risks, through their very
opposition to it, inadvertently reinforcing it: "The revolutionary
movement negatively reflects the situation which it is attacking";
"Whatever seeks to extend itself under domination runs the danger of
reproducing it."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Authoritarian State" [1942]. *Telos* (1973), 5-6.</d-footnote> This task cannot be abdicated even in the ongoing
obliteration and cooptation of revolutionary movements from which the
concepts of early critical theory first emerged, for "the knowledge of
the falling fighter, insofar as it reflects the structure of the present
epoch and the basic possibility of a better one, is not dishonored
because humanity succumbs to bombs and poison gases."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "On the Problem of Truth [1935]." *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings, Max Horkheimer.* Translated by G. Frederick Hunter, Matthew S. Kramer, and John Torpey (MIT Press, 1993), 199-200.</d-footnote> The critical
theorist is tasked with preserving and intensifying our unease with the
world which exists, to return us to these concepts ignited by the
liquidated enemies of capitalist social domination and ensure, by our
own will, that "the truth of them will out."<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Postscript [to Traditional and Critical Theory]." *Critical Theory*. (2002), 251.</d-footnote> This negative unity of
opposites---restless critique of this world and unwavering aim at its
abolition---is the "illusion-free orientation" into which early critical
theory would initiate us.<d-footnote>Horkheimer to Wittfogel, (8/21/1935), *MHGS Vol. 15* (1995), 389-391. Author's translation.</d-footnote>

To the degree we remain loyal to the early critical theorists, our
recovery is critical.<d-footnote>Cf. Horkheimer, "Art and Mass Culture" in *Critical Theory* (2002), 286-289. And, Adorno and Horkheimer, "Thought" from "Notes and Sketches" *Dialectic of Enlightenment.* (2002), 203.</d-footnote> This is, as Adorno expresses and performs it,
the minimum condition of loyalty to dialectical theory:

> Everyone says that Marxism is done for. To this we say, no, it is not
> done for, but rather, that one must remain loyal to it. But if one is
> actually loyal to it, then this can only mean driving the movement of
> the dialectical process further.<d-footnote>Adorno [1939]. *MHGS Vol*. *12* (1985), 524. Author's translation.</d-footnote>

Or, in an uncharacteristically laconic formulation of Horkheimer's:
"Progress in ideas does not consist in "novelty" but in a life-process
in which existing ideas are transformed through the acts by which they
are experienced."<d-footnote>Horkheimer to the Editors of the *Philosophical Review*, April 1949. *Life in Letters* (2007), 270-72.</d-footnote>Rather than pass judgment on the legitimacy of
their esoteric strategy, we seek to engage their work in those terms
which they, rightly or wrongly, concealed, and do so in the name of
overcoming the very "context of delusion"<d-footnote>Adorno, *Negative Dialectics*. Trans. E.B. Ashton (Routledge, 2004), 141, 182, 406.</d-footnote> in which they felt
compelled to conceal them. More than that, we seek to hold them to the
measure of these terms without making excuses for them. To paraphrase
Horkheimer's critique of the apologetic reception of Nietzsche, the
eloquence which would cover for their naivete and illusions, or excuse
them as 'thinkers of their time,' delivers them, having been made
presentable and thereby unintelligible, over to the same society against
which their antagonism was uncompromising and within which they were
compromised.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Bemerkungen zu Jaspers' 'Nietzsche.' " *ZfS* V6, Issue 2, 1937, 407-414.</d-footnote> To paraphrase Adorno's critique of the apologetic
reception of Kierkegaard, for the thorns they felt stinging their own
flesh and turned against society, they deserve, at the very least,
faithful rather than deferential exegesis.<d-footnote>Adorno, "[Double review of Wahl, Jean *Etudes Kierkegaardiennes* & Lowrie, Walter *The Journals of Soren Kierkegaard*]." *ZfS* Jahrgang 8: 1939-1940; V8, Issue 1/2, 1939, 232-235.</d-footnote> To express this
polemically: the living kernels of early critical theory from the works
of the early critical theorists cannot be recovered apart from the
partisan criticism of capitalism, the early critical theorists
themselves, and their critics.

In the following essays, the "non-dogmatic"<d-footnote>Cf. Karl Korsch, "A Non-Dogmatic Approach to Marxism" (1946), transcribed by Anthony Blunden for Marxists.org in 2003 [link: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/korsch/1946/non-dogmatic.htm>]</d-footnote> Marxian core of early
critical theory is emphasized in the spirit of what Horkheimer and
Adorno later call the "productive orthodoxy"<d-footnote>Cf. Horkheimer \"Ernst Simmel und die Freudsche Philosophie\" (1947). *MHGS, Vol. 5* (1987), 396-405. Cf.

Freud: reconstructive fidelity to the boundaries of their thought, the
unresolved integrity of which can only be presented through critique.

In "Essence in the Archaic: Notes Towards a Historical Materialist
Account of the Concept of Essence," Mac Parker takes on the challenge
posed in Marcuse's "Concept of Essence" (1936)<d-footnote>Cf. "ZfS in English" for links to available English translations of the essays published in the ISR's ZfS/SPSS. CTWG Blog, November 6, 2024. <https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2023/ZfS/></d-footnote> the
historical-materialist reconceptualization of the concept of essence,
understood by the early critical theorists as the potential freedom
inherent in different historical situations in which the doctrine of
essence received philosophical elaboration. Responding in kind, Parker
challenges Marcuse's transcendental-idealistic methodological
presuppositions, according to which the task of the theorist is
discovering the schematism through which the thought of a historical
period is determined on the basis of an historical a priori set of
conditions of possibility, which prevent Marcuse from fulfilling this
desideratum. Instead, Parker argues for an alternative model for
theorizing the social determination of thought: beginning from
detail-oriented analysis of historical material, reconstruction of the
asymmetric relations of reciprocal determination between changes in the
economic base (broadly considered) and the philosophical-ideological
superstructure, with a focus on the analysis of the role of
class-situated subjective mediation in the translation of objective
conditions into determinations of thought. The majority of the essay is
a test of this model in the case of the emergence of the concept of
essence in ancient Greece, which provides the basis for a criticism of
competing accounts of the advent of philosophy in Greek antiquity
offered by historians and the early critical theorists themselves (from
Sohn-Rethel to Adorno).

In "On the Falsity of Prevailing Ideas: The Concept of Ideology in Early
Critical Theory," Samuel J. Thomas argues for the importance of
Horkheimer's critique of Karl Mannheim's *Ideology and Utopia* in the
early 1930s for a *critical theory of ideology*.<d-footnote>For a supplementary précis of Mannheim's *Ideology and Utopia*, see Samuel J. Thomas, "Précis of Mannheim's Ideology and Utopia." CTWG Blog, November 12, 2024. <https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2024/Mannheim/></d-footnote> Distinguishing
between *Ideologietheorie* and *Ideologiekritik*, Thomas demonstrates
that Horkheimer's critique of the methodology of Mannheim's 'value-free'
'sociology of knowledge' (*Wissenssoziologie*) turns on this distinction
and, moreover, on the problematic and unreflective separation of these
moments in Mannheim's project. In the course of this reconstruction,
Thomas develops a model for diagnosing the pitfalls of more
contemporary, one-sided approaches to theories and critiques of ideology
and argues that the singular difficulty of analyzing ideology under the
conditions of capitalist social relations requires the adoption of a
specific conception of the dialectical method. Presenting the unity of
*Ideologietheorie* and *Ideologiekritik* in Horkheimer's own work
throughout the 1930s, in which ideology *theory* focuses on the
functional role of ideology in relations of class domination and
ideology *critique* focuses on the relation between ideology and
totality (as well as ideological theories of ideology and totality),
Thomas contextualizes Horkheimer's own conception of ideology as
self-contextualizing. This is required by the self-reflexive core of the
critical theory of ideology, which Thomas calls the 'double
determination' of any inquiry into ideology itself: the mode in which
capitalist social totality determines the object of analysis and the
subject of the researcher who seeks to offer a theory or critique of
ideology. After exhibiting this approach in the case of Horkheimer's own
analysis of the bourgeois revolutionary in the figure of Tommaso
Campanella (inter alia), Thomas concludes with polemical suggestions for
the further development of the critical theory of ideology.

In "Analytic Social Psychology as Critical Social Theory," J.E. Morain
recovers the early work of Erich Fromm, a foundational and unjustly
neglected figure in accounts of the formation of early critical
theory---specifically, the ISR's project of developing an 'analytic
social psychology,' which would provide the conceptual scaffolding of
the group's *Studien über Autorität und Familie* (1936) and, arguably,
the framework and foci of the 'socio-psychological' approach to
empirical research the ISR would use throughout the 1940s, culminating
in *The Authoritarian Personality* (1950).<d-footnote>See Morain's recent report on research conducted at the Erich Fromm archive on the CTWG blog, which reconstructs the systematic, Marxian conception Fromm contributed to the ISR's *Studien über Autorität und Familie* (1936): "The Origins of Studien über Autorität und Familie." CTWG Blog, April 27, 2024. <https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2024/origins_of_the_family/></d-footnote> In this essay, Morain
begins with a critical survey of secondary literature on Fromm's
contribution to 'The Frankfurt School,' which, on the whole, has read
Fromm from a 'standpoint of redemption' that assumes the condemnation of
his work from the outset. In Morain's reconstructive-reparative
approach, Fromm is restored to his role as the author of the
interdisciplinary synthesis of historical materialism and classical
psychoanalysis that underlies the ISR's famous 'Freudo-Marxism':
explanations of the large-scale social phenomena posited by historical
materialism on the basis of the psychic dynamics of individuals as
conceived by Freudian psychoanalysis. Fromm's approach is shown to
outfit early critical theory with the *'microfoundations'* of their
conception of social reproduction. In explicit and militant opposition
to any transhistorical theory of human motivation or 'interests' in the
life of society, as well as to the vulgar Marxist theory of
'reflection,' Fromm reorients social psychology to an analysis of the
*mediation* of economic 'base' and ideological 'superstructure,' social
existence and social consciousness, by the network of institutions in
which the psychic character of individuals is formed---for the sake of
producing functional, capitalist subjects---in the course of capitalist
social reproduction as a whole. In particular, Fromm's focus is on the
*family* as a complex of mediations, which serves, Fromm argues, as the
primary agent of socialization and influence on the social formation of
psychic character-structure. Morain differentiates Fromm's particular
appropriation psychoanalytic theory from that of Freudian orthodoxy and
develops Fromm's distinctive conception of 'analytic social psychology'
in a reconstruction of three basic concepts: social-psychic 'cement'
(distinct from 'ideology' proper), 'the psychic structure of society,'
and a unique concept of 'ideology' in social reproduction, which, in
conjunction, provide the elements for Fromm's social-psychological
'crisis' theory, according to which, as Fromm puts it in his inaugural
essay in the *ZfS*, "the libidinal energies" which comprise the
social-psychic cement "no longer serve the preservation of the society,
but contribute to the development of new social formations. They cease
to be 'cement,' and turn into dynamite."<d-footnote>Fromm, "The Method and Function of an Analytic Social Psychology: Notes on Psychoanalysis and Historical Materialism" [1932]. *The Essential Frankfurt School Reader*. Ed. Andrew Arato and Eike Gebhardt. (New York: Continuum, 1977), 495.</d-footnote> Morain concludes with a
critique of three main limitations in Fromm's work in light of further
developments---past or potential---in the project of developing an
'analytic social psychology.'

In "Horkheimer's Materialism vs Morals and Metaphysics: Its Limitations
and Possibilities," Esther Planas Balduz tackles the problem of the
normative orientation of early critical theory through immanent critique
of Horkheimer's foundational essays on Marxist materialism for the
*ZfS*: "Materialism and Metaphysics" (1932) and "Materialism and Morals"
(1932).<d-footnote>Cf. "ZfS in English." CTWG Blog, November 6, 2024. <https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2023/ZfS/></d-footnote> Namely: how can we account for the moral dimension of the
Marxist materialist's critique of morality? Notwithstanding the critique
of 'value-free' social theory in early critical theory as a whole, and
in Horkheimer's work in particular, Horkheimer himself criticizes moral
conflicts, particularly in moral philosophy, for failing to recognize
that they occur in the context of a world that is itself wrong, a
society that is itself unjust. Planas Balduz begins here, interrogating
the perspective from which the value judgment which assesses the world
qua society as a totality has been---and, perhaps, ought to be---made.
In the course of the essay, Planas Balduz reconstructs the method with
which Horkheimer traces the categories of 'materialism,' 'morality,' and
'metaphysics' proper to each of these fields of judgment back to the
constitutive, modern tension between 'subjective' and 'social' value
judgments about what is considered socially and personally unbearable.
In the above-mentioned foundational essays on Marxist materialism,
Horkheimer argues that, and shows us how, sociology and positivist
philosophy repeat this core tension through the rejection of value
judgement, which binds them to their negative doubles---idealist moral
philosophy of unconditional obligation and proto-totalitarian
romanticism of unconditional self-determination. It is precisely because
of the power of Horkheimer's critique of 'value-free' social theory and
science which, Planas Balduz concludes, compels us to pose two
questions. First, given Horkheimers concern in these essays with
questions of the individual in relation to the moral law, how can we
relate his arguments to the position of the individual relative to the
'second nature' laws of the capitalist market? Or: in what sense is
Horkheimer's 'materialist' critique of morality materialist? Second, to
the extent that materialism requires a critique of morality, how can we
reconcile this with the need to confront the a-moral morality in the
critique of socialism in neoliberal social thought? Or: does
Horkheimer's moral anti-moralism have its own negative double in the
hegemonic discourse of the present?

In "On the Social Situation of Adorno's Critical Music Theory," Zach
Loeffler restores Adorno's eccentric musical perspective in the early
1930s---represented in particular by his first published contribution to
early critical theory in the ISR's orbit, "On the Social Situation of
Music" (1932)---to its own 'social situation': namely, as an effort to
elaborate the theoretical consequences of direct proletarian action and
worker militancy in the first years of the Weimar Republic, its brutal
suppression, and its ongoing structural absence for a critical theory of
artistic production. In the course of the essay, Loeffler reinterprets
"Social Situation" through the late self-critique Adorno provides of the
essay more than three decades later, reconstructing the re-articulation
of Adorno's theory of music through the reconfiguration of several
ambivalences through which his earlier theoretical perspective develops.
In the course of this reinterpretation, Adorno's late musical theory is
itself read in light of the young Adorno's project of thinking music in
its total 'social situation.' The perspective which emerges is as
follows: if music is to do justice to the promise of fulfillment made by
bourgeois art, then it must embody the truth of the untruth of
capitalism and in turn something of a truly free, non-instrumental
sociality bridging the gap between theory and revolutionary praxis; and
if music is to do these things, then its material must be rationalized
past the point where class society necessarily cuts rationalization
short, a process which renders music socially mute and functionless. The
musical rearticulation of Adornos critical theory therefore makes
legible the Marxism of \"consummate negativity\" and maximalist
communism that form the crux of his work, rendering concrete the
negotiation of the problem of freedom vis-à-vis theory and praxis in the
face of intractable social compulsion and the concrete possibility of
realizing its mirror image.
