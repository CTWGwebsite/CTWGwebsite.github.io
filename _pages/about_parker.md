Mac Parker is a communist dilettante organizing with the NYC-DSA Independent Working Class Organizing project and the Brooklyn Eviction Defense Tenant Union. He is currently cooking up a project on the social determination of Ancient Greek philosophy from the Pre-Socratics to Plato & may end up writing something on finance, imperialism and so-called “Monopoly Capitalism” once he figures out what a derivative is.
