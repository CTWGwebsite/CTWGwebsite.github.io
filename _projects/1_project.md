The critical theory working group (CTWG) is proud to present the first volume of Margin Notes. This publication has been a labor of love and we are excited to share it with you! In this page, you will find the PDF and HTML versions of the journal, and a list of the articles included in this volume. To incentivize reading the PDF version of the journal, we have left out some of the appendices from the HTML version. The PDF version contains all the articles and appendices and is our recommended version for reading.
