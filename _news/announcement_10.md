## 2026 Announcement

Critics and Theorists,

We would like to thank everybody who attended the [Fall reading group “Views from Palestine”](/news/announcement\_9/). We not only read some excellent Palestinian scholarship together, which molded us into anti-zionist super soldiers, but managed through your generosity to also raise over a thousand dollars for [the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF)](https://pcrf1.app.neoncrm.com/np/clients/pcrf1/campaign.jsp?campaign=14&fundraiser=1187701&). You can listen to our discussions for free over on the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1686310?view=expanded) with more past recordings on the way!

Secondly, we are happy to announce that [Critique of the Podcast Form](https://linktr.ee/CritiqueofthePodcastForm) is now widely available on most podcast platforms (with the sole exception of Spotify) and should be releasing regularly on a biweekly schedule (every other Thursday) going forward. We have made a Patreon post for listeners to offer feedback. Please let us know what you think there or via our Discord server.

Thirdly, we completed our first dossier on [racketology](projects/2\_project/). We are quite proud of the project. There, you will find introductions to the enigmatic racket concept, various fragmentary applications, new translations, and other articles that we hope you find fruitful.

Fourthly, if you are eager to immerse yourself further in the first generation of Critical Theory, one of our editors at CTWG, James Crane, has been posting various excellent translations over his substack [Substudies](https://jamescrane.substack.com/).

Fifthly, if you haven’t done so already, check out our newest articles: [J. E. Morain’s two-part article investigating right-wing violence](https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ReactionPt1/) and [Anatarah Bin AlKaf’s reconstructive introduction to Boris Hessen](https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RootsandBranches_Hessen/). We would love to know what you think about them via our new blog comment section! Moreover, we received an [excellent user submission](https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Competition/) from Jack Barrett replying to one of our racketology articles. There, Jack beautifully clarified the economic presuppositions and various transformations that Adorno and Horkheimer detect in their theory of monopoly. It is a fantastic contribution. If you too would like to write in our blog, please head over to our [blog guidelines](/blog/2025/Blog-Submissions/) for more information.

Finally, and most importantly, we are excited to announce that *Margin Notes* Volume 2 is actively in the works. It should be published early 2026—expect more news on that soon!
