### I. Topic

Starting Saturday, June 1st, join us for seven, once-weekly collective struggle sessions over Adorno and Horkheimer’s [Dialectic of Enlightenment](https://monoskop.org/images/2/27/Horkheimer_Max_Adorno_Theodor_W_Dialectic_of_Enlightenment_Philosophical_Fragments.pdf) (1947), a book (to tweak Nietzsche’s subtitle for Zarathustra) for no one and no one. In this exploratory session, we’ll have it out with the authors, the last half-century of their readers, and each other as we work to establish a general sense of the core problematic and project of the text and try to reconstruct the reasons for its hyper-conscious and hyper-confounding method of presentation.

One of the primary desiderata of this session will be making the ‘esoteric’ (Marxist) text of DoE – in the (largely untranslated) preparatory sketches and notes, internal IFS seminars, letters, and Diskussionsprotokolle – exoteric by (1) collecting the strongest extant English-language secondary literature on the topic and making it accessible in a shared file and (2) working together on first-pass English translations of some previously untranslated primary source materials.

### II. Full schedule

1. June 1st, “Prefaces” to DoE. (James/Crane)
2. June 8th, “Concept of Enlightenment” (James/Crane)

6. July 6th, “Elements of Anti-Semitism: Limits of Enlightenment” (J.E. Morain)
