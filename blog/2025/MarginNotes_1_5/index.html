Adorno and Max Horkheimer, <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment,</em> 1944-2002.</p> </blockquote> <p>For the Marxist materialist, value judgement generally appears in two forms: as the return of the repressed in undecidable moral conflicts, and as the comprehensive judgement of the materialist. It can be argued, however, that for Max Horkheimer conflicts over moral wrongs and moral rights nevertheless take place in a worthless, wrong, false society or world. However, this assessment already implies that a value judgement has been activated in that which is judged as wrong, false, or worthless: the world qua society as a totality.<d-footnote>Different translations use conflicting terms for the original German term -- *falsche* -- that was used by Horkheimer (and Adorno) in some English renderings we find the word "false" and in others "wrong." The same happens with some concepts related to totality, one is "society" and the other is "world." A specific reference to the "wrong world" appears, for instance, in Theodor W. Adorno's *Negative Dialectics*, when he explains the necessity of dialectics as "the ontology of the wrong state of things," and then more exactly: "The chances are that every citizen of the *wrong world* [emphasis added] would find the right one unbearable; he would be too impaired for it." Adorno, T. W. (1990) *Negative Dialectics,* trans, E.B. Ashton (London, Routledge) 11, 352. However, Max Horkheimer echoes this standpoint when he states that, "I can say what is wrong, but I cannot say what is right." Max Horkheimer as quoted in W. Bonefeld, "Emancipatory Praxis and Conceptuality in Adorno," in *Negativity &amp; Revolution: Adorno and Political Activism*, edited by F. Matamoros, S. Tischler, J. Holloway, 2009, 145.</d-footnote><br> From the depths of this wrong world, Horkheimer’s essays on materialism, morality, and metaphysics trace the categories belonging to each field of argument back to the modern tension between ‘subjective’ and ‘social’ value judgments about what is considered socially and personally unbearable. In these texts, Horkheimer shows us how sociology and positivist philosophy repeat this core tension through the rejection of value judgement, which binds them to their negative doubles – idealist moral philosophy of unconditional obligation and proto-totalitarian romanticism of unconditional self-determination. Given Horkheimer’s concern in these essays with questions of the individual in relation to the moral law, how can we relate his arguments to the ‘second nature’ laws of the market? And how can we point out the probable error of the total abandonment of morality (as ethics) for the Marxist critical theorist and his aspirations, when confronted with the amoral morality of the actions and critique of socialism of the neoliberal philosophers?</p> <h2 id="horkheimers-critical-theory-a-negative-stream-of-morals">Horkheimer’s Critical Theory: A Negative Stream of Morals?</h2> <p>Max Horkheimer’s account of materialism versus morals and metaphysics in his essays for the Institute for Social Research (IfS) like “Materialism and Morality” (1933) and “Materialism and Metaphysics” (1933) brings to the fore the crisis inherent in the critique of the Enlightenment. More specifically, it reveals the crisis in its establishment of moral principles understood as practical social imperatives – a tendency most explicitly exposed in Hegel’s critique of Kant’s moral arguments through his concept of the Ethical Life (<em>Sittlichkeit</em>).<d-footnote>See Jean Hyppolite on morality versus ethical life in Hegel: "...Hegel investigates beyond morality (Moralität), which according to Kant and Fichte expresses only the point of view of the acting individual, the living reality of morals and institutions (Sittlichkeit). Virtue, in the present sense of the term, has a clearly individualistic meaning. It corresponds to the moment of opposition between the individual and his people."It was not like ancient virtue which was a substantial virtue," which found its content in the very life of the people. In order to make the very important distinction which Hegel makes here between the terms Moralität and Sittlichkeit, we shall adopt the expressions "morality" and "ethical world" as a practice. The choice of the word "ethical" is of course rather arbitrary, but it has the advantage of being connected etymologically to the Greek term ethos (custom, use), which Hegel considers as being equivalent to the German term Sitte. Doubtless the word "morality" is also connected to mores, but this inevitable etymology certainly indicates that morality in the Kantian sense of the term is only a part, and not the whole, of ethical life. It corresponds only to the stage of subjective reflection and is situated between the immediate life in a people and the objective organization of society and state." Jean Hyppolite, *Introduction to Hegel's Philosophy of History*, trans. Bond Harris and B. Spurlock Jacqueline (Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 1996), 8.</d-footnote> The break with Kantian <em>Moralität</em> implied in Hegel’s critique of it seemed later to be furthered (or perhaps even completed?) by Karl Marx in his critical deprecation of morality as a mere tactical mediation by the bourgeoisie in order to effectively subjugate a class it needed to control and dominate.<d-footnote>"The question whether Marx's theory has a moral or ethical dimension is one of the most controversial of all issues of Marx interpretation. The difficulty is easily seen. On the one hand, Marx has a number of uncompromisingly negative things to say about morality. Moreover, after 1845 at least, he affirms that his own theory is not a utopian or ethical one but 'real positive science.' Yet, on the other hand, much of the language that he uses to describe capitalism is plainly condemnatory (for instance, that it is antagonistic, oppressive, and exploitative). Does this not represent an inconsistency on Marx's part? Is he not moralizing and rejecting morality at the same time?" Michael Rosen, "The Marxist Critique of Morality and the Theory of Ideology," in *Morality, Reflection, and Ideology*, ed. Edward Harcourt (Oxford University Press, 2000), 21.</d-footnote> This is noted in Jean Hippolite’s account of the case, but the story is being treated here in a more holistic sense, where all the facets and tensions intrinsic to the prior rejection and critique of morality are seen expanding to a rejection of ethics, as we see happening from Marx on.<d-footnote>See footnote 2 above on Jean Hyppolite's description of the diversion from morals in Kant. For us, there is no strong separation between morals and ethics. This is not because there are no interpretative facets and crises involving these terms, but precisely because all such problems are inevitably included when the matter is interpreted by critics and antagonists -- present here both in the form of both left-wing, Marxist materialists and right-wing, fascistic radical libertarians, who will be cited further below. However, across the work of Horkheimer (as well as Adorno, Furner, and Rose) we will find that these concepts and variants are sometimes conflated, as when Horkheimer speaks of "...a philosophical system, an ethic, a moral teaching" Max Horkheimer, *Dawn &amp; Decline: Notes 1926--1931 and 1950--1969*, trans. Michael Shaw, (New York: Seabury Press, 1978), 34--5.</d-footnote><br> At the same time, the bourgeois moral field of the Enlightenment exercised a self-regulating and repressive subjection of its peers at a time when it enjoyed the egoistic transactive presumption of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.<d-footnote>See Marx and Engels, "Moralising Criticism and Critical Morality, A Contribution to German Cultural History, Contra Karl Heinzen," in *Marx and Engels Collected Works*, vol. 6, *1845--48: Principles and Manifesto* (London: Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1976). 312-340.</d-footnote> However, as it has been pointed out by Ferenc Feher, Kant’s political philosophy (beyond his explicit work on morals and the corpus of his critiques) cannot be ignored when considering what from Kant’s system was preserved and integrated into Marx’s work and critical methodology.<d-footnote>"Immanuel Kant, and not Hegel, who forged a methodological axiom from this attitude, was the first great political philosopher of modernity. In marked contrast to most of his predecessors Kant did not design political-philosophical blueprints for future action from past models. Rather, through constant thought experiments, Kant transformed the present process understood as history into the raw material as well as a treasure trove of unresolved dilemmas for political philosophy." Ferenc Fehér,, "Practical Reason in the Revolution: Kant's Dialogue with the French Revolution," in *The French Revolution and the Birth of Modernity*, ed. Ferenc Fehér (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1990), 204--5.</d-footnote> This point was somehow supported—albeit in an accusatory, negative way—by the (counter-revolutionary) Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises early in the 20th century in his obsessive effort to debunk Marx, socialism, and all of its philosophers when he defined the idealist philosophy of Kant as to be the root of all of its evils.<d-footnote>For a Marxist view of Von Mises and context, see John Bellamy Foster, "Absolute Capitalism," *Monthly Review* 71, no. 1 (May 2019).</d-footnote> It is worth quoting von Mises at length here, if only to illustrate and help us to situate those paradoxical elements, constituted in the rejection of morality, which inhabit the Marxist materialist philosophers. Marx and the Marxists had categorically rejected the use of morals and the appeal to ethics, while at the same time being accused of promoting an essentially moral and ethical enterprise. In a chapter subsection titled “The Categorical Imperative as a Foundation for Socialism” von Mises is indeed categorical:</p> <blockquote> <p>Engels called the German Labour Movement the heir to the German classical philosophy. It would be more correct to say that German (not only Marxian) Socialism represents the decadence of the school of idealist philosophy. Socialism owes the dominion it won over the German mind to the idea of society as conceived by the great German thinkers. Out of Kant’s mysticism of duty and Hegel’s deification of the State it is easy to trace the development of socialist thought; Fichte is already a socialist. In recent decades the revival of Kantian criticism, that much praised achievement of German philosophy, has benefited Socialism also. The Neo-Kantians, especially Friedrich Albert Lange and Hermann Cohen, have declared themselves socialists. Simul­taneously marxians have tried to reconcile Marxism with the New Criticism. Ever since the philosophical foundations of Marxism have shown signs of cracking, attempts to find in critical philosophy support for socialist ideas have multiplied. (…) The weakest part of Kant’s system is his ethics. Although they are vitalized by his mighty intellect, the grandeur of individual concepts does not blind us to the fact that his starting-point is unfortunately chosen and his fundamental conception a mistaken one. His desperate attempt to uproot Eudemonism has failed.<d-footnote>Ludwig von Mises, *Socialism*, trans. J. Kahane, 6th ed, Liberty Fund Library of the Works of Ludwig von Mises (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund Inc., 2014), 430.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Von Mises was ably refuted by his Marxist opponents, the Austromarxists Max Adler and Helene Bauer, but seeing the nature of von Mises’s critique of Kant, Hegel, and Marx in the light of our present situation, we feel compelled to reflect on the possibility that the rejection of morality in Marx and the Marxists after him arose from (and, by its very nature, responded to) the need to avoid the liberal’s legacy of constant accusations that their project was excessively moralistic.<d-footnote>See the refutations against Von Mises by Helen Bauer. According to Dunja Larise: "Helene Bauer was one of the leading economists of Austro-Marxism, an intellectual circle close to Austria's Social Democratic Workers' Party between two world wars, which aimed to create a new socialist society by democratic means. Between 1923 and 1926, she contended with what would later become known as the Austrian School of Economics and its' most remarkable theoreticians: Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich von Hayek, and Joseph Schumpeter. These debates revolved around issues relevant even today. Although important for the history of economic theory and methodology in the social sciences, these debates were largely forgotten. The present article aims at filling this gap by revisiting the debate between Helene Bauer and the Austrian School of Economics around the general conceptions of the theory of value, attribution of value, and an appropriate methodology for the study of economics as a social science. The last part of the article shows a discord between Helene Bauer and Ludwig Mises on social justice, democracy, and authoritarianism in interwar Austria." Dunja Larise, "Helene Bauer and Austrian School of Economics: Disputes on Neoliberalism and Social Democracy in the Early Twentieth Century," *Revue Européenne Des Sciences Sociales* 61, no. 1 (May 2023): 221--41.</d-footnote> Today, von Mises and his disciples seem to have won the conscience of our global Western world, though not without having had to invest an unprecedented amount of (black) gold to take action (often militarily) in the most ruthless and undemocratic tactical interventions around the globe, as Jessica Whyte has very well explained in her work <em>The Morals of the Market</em>.<d-footnote>That the progress towards a conscience that evolves to an organic socialism has proved to be a real threat for all these radical capitalist amoral moralists, and their vision and project had needed to employ invest masses of money and complot to achieve its goals for disparaging such organic evolution. Jessica Whyte explains this very well in *The Morals of the Market: Human Rights and the Rise of Neoliberalism* (London and New York: Verso, 2019).</d-footnote></p> <p>The question of morality in Marx has been interrogated many times, but that question has not generally been given a central role in the Marxist research on the Frankfurt School. Our argument here is that the critique of morality and metaphysics in Horkheimer’s early work uses – or rather, is based on – a Kantian form of values and judgements that allows (and sustains) his critique of specific moral and metaphysical trends of his time. This means that the critical rejection of the Kantian system and its (moral) categorical imperative was not fully achieved, nor was the Kantian system fully overcome. Rather, it was merely sublated, transported, or smuggled back through a moral transplantation of an anti-moral core. This Kantian legacy then appears as an antinomy at the heart of Horkheimer’s critique of morality, insofar as these critiques inherit the Kantian form, albeit in their own specificity: mediated by either Hegel’s or Marx’s sublations of the two systems. The Marxian sublation of the Kantian form is used to enable the negative but morally invested content of a critique of all the problematic aspects of the base and superstructure of our capitalist regime and the relational and dependency dynamics of its (Western and globalist) society: its political economy, its legal system, its ideology, and all its dominant forms of imperialism and class domination. (The apparent sublating and activating of the Kantian form by Marx and the paradoxes that it generates is explored by James Furner, as we will see further below.)</p> <p>Horkheimer’s core dialectical proposal in relation to “the economy” will serve us here in presenting his account, in which the tensions over morality and ethics are played out in the materialist critique of the capitalist world:</p> <blockquote> <p>The economy is the first cause of wretchedness, and critique, theoretical and practical, must address itself primarily to it. It would be mechanistic, not dialectical thinking, however, to judge the future forms of society solely according to their economy. Historical change does not leave untouched the relations between the spheres of culture, and if in the present state of society economy is the master of man and therefore the lever by which he is to be moved to change, in the future men must themselves determine all their relationships in the face of natural necessities. Economics in isolation will therefore not provide the norm by which the community of men is to be measured.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Postscript," in *Critical Theory: Selected Essays*, trans. Matthew J. O'Connell (New York: Continuum, 1975), 249.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Later in this essay we will see Horkheimer’s claim that metaphysics has missed its historical chance and thus failed society – a lament for metaphysics similar to Marx’s earlier lament for philosophy. My argument here is that in order to critique morality, Horkheimer still required (and was methodologically dependent upon) the deployment of the structural element of practical moral philosophy as form, while simultaneously inverting – in a Hegelian-Marxist manner – the general content, thus delivering a new, updated and situated discursive field. This understanding allows us a twofold, dialectical notion of both the structure and content: an inescapability of the moral dimension embedded at the core of Marx’s project – which I will analyse here in relation to Horkheimer’s critique – and its outcome as a different morality, which emerges as a negative moral and ethical (new) field of concern for specific points, produced without necessarily being recognised or described as such. In this way, we can see how Horkheimer presented the moral field, in its inherently Kantian aspect, as preserved in elements of its form and structure, in which its accustomed (bourgeois and traditional) content was discarded and replaced by specific spatio-temporal and socially situated materialist concerns. After the Kantian turn, however, the Hegelian revolt against the limitations, flaws, and rigidities of that system showed us how the notion of continuous movement and historical progress was an insufficient reason for a complete denial of a function of our understanding of the works of our mind.</p> <p>The problem of the mind and the subjective, as it is understood in the field of Freudian psychology, brings with it the notion of ideology and reification that had so troubled Horkheimer (and Adorno). Both had to grapple with the task of producing a new field of specific critical theory based on materialist paradigms and a critique of what is and what is not morality or metaphysics.<d-footnote>"Autonomously attempting to decide whether one's actions are good or evil is plainly a late historical phenomenon. A highly developed European individual is not only able to bring important decisions into the light of clear consciousness and morally evaluate them -- such individuals also have this capacity in regard to most of the primarily instinctual and habitual reactions that make up the bulk of their lives... As the principle of authority was undermined and a significant number of individuals acquired substantial decision-making power over the conduct of their lives, the need emerged for a spiritual guideline that could substitute for this principle's eroding bases in orienting the individual in this world. The acquisition of moral principles was important for members of the higher social strata, since their position constantly demanded that they make intervening decisions which they had earlier been absolved of by authority. At the same time, a rationally grounded morality became all the more necessary to dominate the masses in the state when a mode of action diverging from the their life interests was demanded of them." Max Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," in *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, ed. G. Frederick Hunter et al., Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993), 15--6.</d-footnote> At the same time, the question of ideology is one of the great challenges involving morality and ethics, as they are very susceptible to manipulation and instrumentalisation. It is therefore relevant for this study to examine what Horkheimer’s close adherence to the Marxist abolition of morality entailed, in order to find out to what extent he was able to fulfil the ideal of the task, or if, on the contrary, he – like Hegel and Marx before him – had to revert, albeit partially, to the system of the Copernican turn in order to make it possible. The issues of normativity and the role of value judgement are relevant here, for without them it would not even have been possible to address the case at hand. A value judgement is part of the process of judging, and judging is both a subjective mental property that is reproduced as a social activity with its roots (for the Protestant West) in the history of law and religion, to later become an essential part of the development of science. Horkheimer defence of materialism shows that</p> <blockquote> <p>Even exchange value in the economy is not based on free valuation but rather ensues from the life process of society, in which use values are determining factors. The undialectical concept of the free subject is foreign to materialism. It is also well aware of its own conditionality. Apart from personal nuances, this latter is to be sought in connection with those forces which are devoted to the realization of the aims stated above. Because materialist science never takes its eyes away from these aims, it does not assume the character of false impartiality, but is consciously biased.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 46--7.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>There is a relationship and a tension between the personal subjective capacity for thought and judgement and the socially constructed form, and this was the concern of Kant, Hegel, Marx and Horkheimer.<d-footnote>"Within the soul, a struggle is played out between personal interest and a vague conception of the general interest, between individual and universal objectives. Yet it remains obscure how a rational decision based upon criteria is possible between the two. There arise an endless reflection and constant turmoil which are fundamentally impossible to overcome. Since this problematic tension playing itself out in the inner lives of human beings necessarily derives from their role in the social life process, Kant's philosophy, being a faithful reflection of this tension, is a consummate expression of its age. The basis of the spiritual situation in question is easily recognized upon consideration of the structure of the bourgeois order. (...)" Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 19.</d-footnote> In effect, what is evident in Horkheimer’s work is the explicit negation of morality and morals as simultaneously (dialectically?) conflated while the argument continues to maintain and sustain at the core of its discourse against morality a series of moral imperatives and practical oughts. This reproduces (smuggles back?) the Kantian categorical imperative and the value judgement that haunts Marxist critique.<d-footnote>James Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant: A Marxist Critique of Kant's Ethics*, Historical Materialism Book Series 271 (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2023), 98--103.</d-footnote> An example of the way in which morality is dialectically rejected is this paragraph from Horkheimer’s essay,</p> <blockquote> <p>The structure of needs in various forms of society, in particular social groups, and in individuals is changeable and can be explained only in relation to a specific time and a concrete situation. The known and unknown devotees of the materialist outlook have for centuries given up their freedom and their lives in the struggle for the most varied goals, but especially in solidarity with suffering men. They prove that a concern for personal physical well-being is no more closely associated with this kind of thinking than with any other. In rejecting the illusions of idealist metaphysics, they have surrendered every hope of an individual reward in eternity and, with it, an important selfish motive operative in other men. Repeated attempts to interpret such selfless dedication to the causes of humanity as a contradiction to materialist convictions lack every philosophical justification. What leads to such misunderstandings is the simplistic psychology which lies behind most doctrines that profess an absolute morality.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Materialism and Metaphysics," in *Critical Theory: Selected Essays*, trans. Matthew J. O'Connell (New York, NY: Continuum, 1933), 44.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Horkheimer’s reflections above play with the inescapability of the moral (and ethical) constitutive elements of the subject of man, understood as a species being, as Marx had it, in general, and in particular in its progressive inescapability in relation to the exercise of a critical theory associated with the Marxist standpoint and materialist methodology.</p> <p>In this sense, to understand that to criticise what configures a so-called “wrong world” is in itself a moral act involving a value judgement, even if it is a fully committed and profound exercise of a critique of morality, morals and moralising as bourgeois instruments. Since its predicate is the “wrong” of the world, this judgement (of being wrong) takes us back to the Kantian judgement and the Hegelian and Marxian disputes. And therefore to ask whether those inherited Kantian orientations between ethics and law, which the Marxists had taken up after Hegel’s rejection of Kant’s morality, had brought into their core forms a kind of systematic moral versus a moral glitch. Furthermore, it can be frankly said that it is not possible to see how an emancipatory and systemic social revolution could come into being and realise its project without its own set of categorical imperatives, its ideas of values and norms; of what it stands for and against, of what it has changed and wants to change, regulate or legislate for. We do not mean by this the Kantian afterthought of what the revolution does once it has won its place as a new institution, but the moral imperatives against slavery or class division and subjugation that have driven such revolutions. Perhaps here the return to a closely studied aspect of Kant’s philosophy can be understood as a necessary step for the researcher.<d-footnote>See Lea Ypi, "On Revolution in Kant and Marx," *Political Theory* 42, no. 3 (June 2014): 262--87. Ypi brings forth a relevant question about the subject of Revolution and its theoretical support in Kant, albeit perhaps in certain cryptic modes due to censorship, and offers a comment of the Kantian standpoint that refreshes our general assumptions on the subject of the conservatism of Kant.</d-footnote> What we are suggesting here on the question of morality is that Marxist theorists – including Marx himself and critical theorists such as Horkheimer – had developed a negative dialectical position, influenced by Hegel, on morality along with ethics, without being able to properly remove the moral categorical imperatives from their propositions or systems.<d-footnote>Horkheimer: "Due to the lack of rational organization of the social whole which his labor benefits, he cannot recognize himself in his true connection to it and knows himself only as an individual whom the whole affects somewhat, without it ever becoming clear how much and in what manner his egoistic activity actually affects it. The whole thus appears as an admonition and demand which troubles precisely the progressive individuals at their labor, both in the call of conscience and in moral deliberation." Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 20.</d-footnote></p> <p>This dependency must be something that can be explored in materialist terms, i.e. without falling into an idealist, pre-Marxist discourse on morals. One example between many of the cases rests in Horkheimer’s <em>“</em>Materialism and Metaphysics<em>“</em>: “The various materialist doctrines, therefore, are not examples of a stable and permanent idea. The economic theory of society and history arose not out of purely theoretical motives, but out of the need to comprehend contemporary society. For this society has reached the point where it excludes an ever larger number of men from the happiness made possible by the widespread abundance of economic forces.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Metaphysics," , 45.</d-footnote> The fact that these categorical imperatives are thus most intensely perceived by all the amoral theorists of the liberal and neo-liberal projects, including those embracing Fascism and Nazism, contributes to their prosecutorial denunciation of the constraining and rigid moralist mission of the projects of socialism and communism. It serves the fascist pseudo-revolutionary discourses of liberation and total freedom from the so-called leftist state authoritarianism that is so familiar and omnipresent in both fascist and neoliberal discourses today. Morality, which was and is, so rejected in Marxist theory, thus appears as the return of the repressed; as a visible sign of weakness in the project of the Left, while its own possibilities for struggle in the field of ideology (and morality) are, as it were, denied by its own logical will to a no-moral, i.e. amoral, position.</p> <h2 id="the-form-of-the-research">The Form of the Research</h2> <p>In this study, I will examine how these specific legacies and critical tensions concerning morality, morals and ethics mentioned in the introduction above came into play in Horkheimer’s critique of morality and metaphysics in the context of the project of the early Frankfurt School. I will also consider the inherent dichotomy of form and content – and its complicated aspects – at play in his materialist critique of morality. The questions posed in this essay are negative, as we reflect on a lack and an explicit negation – the disavowal of morality – that has followed the Hegelian transformation of morality into Ethical Life. For these purposes, I have engaged mainly with two other authors: James Furner, who proposes rescuing autonomy from Kant for further Marxist methodologies that include ethics, and Gillian Rose, whose critique of Adorno and the Frankfurt School gives us insights into navigating these inherent problematics of morality and ethics from both her work on Adorno and Hegel. In <em>The Melancholy Science</em>, British philosopher Gillian Rose argues that Adorno’s critique of morality takes the standpoint of the critical moralist and shows how, for Adorno, morality thus becomes form, or what she, following Adorno, terms as style.<d-footnote>Rose uses the specific title from one of Adorno's passages in *Minima Moralia*, named "Morals and Style," as the header of one of her chapters to situate the 'moral' tensions of content and form that are implied in the philosophy of Theodor W. Adorno. This particular case illustrates the point of relevancy to the question of the unavoidable escape from morals and the even more unavoidable need to recur to moral systems to help the task of a critique of specific morals involved in the repression and self-control of the subject in the capitalist totality.</d-footnote></p> <p>My approach to the tensions latent in the Marxist abolition of morality owes much to Gillian Rose’s approach to dealing with antinomies in her promotion of the Hegelian speculative standpoint and addressing the intrinsic conceptual difficulty she posits in the Hegelian concept of <em>Aufhebung</em>.<d-footnote>See also Rose's remarks on the difficulties of morality and value in Neo-Kantianism. Gillian Rose, *Hegel Contra Sociology* (London: Verso, 2009), 8.</d-footnote> This research follows an initial incursion into the topic in the series of seminars given as part of the Critical Theory Working Group’s explorations of the early IfS. What interests me is examining how Horkheimer established the conceptual parameters for a Critical Theory capable of fulfilling its task (understood as the generation of new critical methodologies, also as a praxis) as necessarily existing within and against a “wrong world.” It is precisely this specific motivational standpoint – the struggle against the “wrong world” – that the Institute for Social Research saw as a moral (social) imperative.<d-footnote>For the architects of the neoliberal world view such as Ludwig von Mises, though not exclusively, socialism constituted a moral imperative. See Ludwig von Mises's work *Socialism,* where he dedicates much space to destroying the notion that Marx and subsequent Marxists got rid of morals and the ethical. Ludwig von Mises, *Socialism, An Economic and Sociological Analysis*, 6th ed. (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund Inc., 1981), particularly chapter 4.</d-footnote></p> <p>The anti-moral critique mobilised by neo-liberal discourses and their anarcho-libertarian appeal to a fully abstracted and all-embracing concept of freedom (for the liberation of markets and the crushing of the welfare state against what they see as the unjustly repressive application of human rights) has been the subject of particularly clarifying Marxist critiques, such as Jessica White’s <em>The Morals of the Market</em>.<d-footnote>Whyte, *The Morals of the Market*.</d-footnote> In White’s work, figures like Ludwig von Mises, Milton Friedman, and Friedrich Hayek – among others – are exposed for what they are: moralist anti-moralists. However, the anti-moral attitude can be better understood in retrospect because the actors against morality (or metaphysics) have to be very clear about their position as Marxist materialists and not libertarians or anarcho-capitalists. Moreover, the will to critique (based on the concept of immanent critique) on the left and from a Marxist materialist standpoint is a very specific, concrete kind of will, one not without its own dialectical problems. A key point of the commitment to immanent critique is to see critical thinking and writing as part of a (potentially political) praxis.<d-footnote>This relates directly to Karl Marx's statement: "The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism by weapons, material force must be overthrown by material force; but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses. Theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates *ad hominem*, and it demonstrates *ad hominem* as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp the root of the matter. But for man the root is man himself. The evident proof of the radicalism of German theory, and hence of its practical energy, is that it proceeds from a resolute *positive* abolition of religion." Marx, "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Law: Introduction," in *Marx and Engels: 1843--44*, Collected Works 3 (London: Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1975), 175--88.</d-footnote><d-footnote>Horkheimer argues that critical theory is based on 'right willing' as much as right thinking in the *"*Truth*"* essay from the ZfS, and that the importance of the will is what ties together the 'critical attitude' at the end of "Traditional and Critical Theory." In "On the Problem of Truth," Horkheimer says: "The correction and further definition of the truth is not taken care of by History, so that all the cognizant subject has to do is passively observe, conscious that even his particular truth, which contains the others negated in it, is not the whole. Rather, the truth is advanced because the human beings who possess it stand by it unbendingly, apply it and carry it through, act according to it, and bring it to power against the resistance of reactionary, narrow, one-sided points of view. The process of cognition includes real historical will and action just as much as it does learning from experience and intellectual comprehension. The latter cannot progress without the former." Horkheimer, "On the Problem of Truth," in *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, ed. G. Frederick Hunter et al. (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993), 193.</d-footnote> One should be able to distinguish a series of elements and conditions both necessary and sufficient to make a critique of the social, political, juridical, and economic from a distinct standpoint on the left. This critique is connected to the process of a philosophy that enters into new domains – situated in concrete historical time and a specific social context – a philosophy defined by the IfS and Max Horkheimer as Critical Theory.</p> <p>James Furner’s work <em>Rescuing Autonomy from Kant: A Marxist Critique of Kant’s Ethics</em> elaborates that there are a series of theses inherent in the Marxist rejection of morals, which he unfolds across four theses and three parts intending to defend “a new way of thinking about the relation of Marx’s project to Kant’s ethics.”<d-footnote>Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 114.</d-footnote> In the first part of his book, he explores these propositions through a series of key arguments and the conceptual reasons for their rejection of Kantian ethics as either irrelevant, complementary, or incompatible. One issue that will be argued below is the possibility of a concept that supports negative morality and/or a kind of moral judgement that is in itself a revolutionising of the Kantian moral judgement (as modified by Marx). The idea is that ethics belongs to a moral form in itself, which was developed especially in the work of Hegel. However, something is produced with Marx’s critique of Hegel that appears as a relapse into Kantian forms, even if it competes with their aims. It mobilises the categorical imperative in full view.</p> <p>On one of the various accounts of Marx’s own use of the categorical imperative, Furner quotes Marx’s introduction to the <em>Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right</em> to illustrate Marx’s use of the categorical imperative: “[t]he critique of religion culminates in the doctrine that the human being is the supreme being for the human being, and thus with the categorical imperative to overthrow all relations in which the human being is a debased, enslaved, abandoned, despicable being.”<d-footnote>Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 114.</d-footnote> In this statement from Marx – which is not the only one of this type – it is possible to grasp why Furner’s emphasis is on Marx’s formal dependence on the Kantian categorical imperative, even if, as Furner suggests, it is only “partly” mobilised by Marx to “rival” Kant’s scientific and critical-philosophical notions. Furthermore, it is relevant here to consider the conceptual and methodological process at work in Marx’s production of this rivalry with Kantian formulations. For Furner, “Marx is significant in his suggestion of a post-Kantian ethics, in which autonomy is located at the level of a human community.”<d-footnote>Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 116.</d-footnote> This claim is examined closely in Furner’s study where he posits how a Marxist critique of Kant’s ethics is based on two steps or arguments.<d-footnote>This is how Furner presents the case which we mentioned above: "If Marx has a conception of freedom as the autonomy of a human community, then Marx is committed to a critique of Kant's ethics. A conception of freedom as the autonomy of a human community is a rival conception of autonomy to that of Kant. [...] As human beings are interdependent, needy beings with capacities that we can develop, no account of what we are required to obey can omit the fact of our social dynamics. [...] This conception of self-regulative human community entails a critique of Kant's ethics, as Kant does not locate autonomy at the community level, or restrict it to human beings." Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 112.</d-footnote> One is the argument against Kant’s involvement with religion, and thus, “subject to a critique of religion [of how] our application of Kant’s formulas of the categorical imperative relies on a belief in the existence of God, but [of how, and precisely] Kant offers us “no good reason” to believe in God’s existence.”<d-footnote>That "Kant does not offer a good (moral or practical) reason for believing that God exists should already tell us something about Kant's use of the figure of God as replacing a Greek Logos." Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 116.</d-footnote> Kant’s God is effectively displaced by a personal, individualised but socially binding morality, in a “non-timeless grounding argument for the value of the autonomy of a human community.”<d-footnote>Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 116.</d-footnote> For which the key point at work will be that “ethical principles based on this value must be shown to be able to condemn what is wrong with capitalism and to recommend socialism, without relying on any unjustified religious belief.”<em><d-footnote>Emphasis mine. Here one can see the reverberation with Horkheimer's idea for the necessity of Critical Theory for and about a "wrong world." The concept and statement of the wrong world is in itself a moral injunction.</d-footnote>/</em><d-footnote>Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 116.</d-footnote></p> <p>The case of the Kantian disavowal of “autonomy at the level of the community” is key to this study. One question is how the isolated subject, which Kant presents as part of a community of equals in his imperative not to treat the other as a means, can be transformed into a fully conforming community, which he seems to deny. This tension within the Hegelian “I that is we” contained in Marx’s critique of Kant can be revisited here to understand how the subject in Kant is not understood as solitary or separate from society. If we closely read the passage from Furner quoted above, we find how Marx’s critique of Kant’s ethics – based on freedom as the autonomy of a human community – is deployed as a “rival” conception of autonomy to the individualistic concept of Kant. For us, this conceptual situation opens at the same time to the possibility that such a quality, viz. being a “rival,” does not necessarily have to imply one-sided opposition; rather, it becomes closer to a perfected form of dialectical sublation. Thus we can see, in one way or another, how Marx’s “mischievous”<d-footnote>Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 114.</d-footnote> use of the Kantian ethical system left his disciples to grapple with all sorts of contradictions and paradoxes insidiously encrusted at the core of their discourses. Furner exposes these implicit tensions occurring in other Marxist authors:</p> <blockquote> <p>To reconcile the idea that Marx’s is similar to that of Kant’s, in viewing freedom as autonomy, with the thought that Marx condemns capitalism at the system-level and in terms of community, Feenberg would have to reject the claim that Marx viewed autonomy a quality of a ‘rational individual’, in favour of the idea of self-legislative human community. Marx’s commitment to autonomy could then be thought to align with his concept of social revolution.<d-footnote>Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 114.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In a sense, Furner’s study ends up implying that the question of ethics for Marxist theorists (and this will include Marxists such as Horkheimer) is still unresolved and relevant today.</p> <p>The famous categorical imperative set out in Marx’s introduction to the <em>Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right</em> is, as Furner notes, “remarkable.” Furner argues that the comment is so “remarkable” precisely because Marx invokes “a concept coined by Kant, the ‘categorical imperative’, in the introduction to critique aimed at Hegel – aimed, indeed, at the very text in which Hegel describes Kant’s ethics as an empty formalism.” He goes on to state that this “should give pause to the kind of hand-waving that insists that Marxism cannot take anything from Kant’s ethics because Marx regarded Hegel as having exposed its empty formalism.”<d-footnote>Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 114.</d-footnote> Following an interrogation of Marx’s arguments, Furner sees that Marx’s “declaration commits him to a post-Kantian conception of autonomy, on which the subject of autonomy is a subject from which defective relations can be thought of as expunged: a human community.”<d-footnote>Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 114.</d-footnote> Here placing the indissociable nature of morals and ethics (normativity) from the political subject as core for political praxis—not as cause-effect but implied in a kind of Hegelian movement, or, to put it more radically, as a kind of mischievous Marxist move.</p> <h2 id="horkheimers-hegelian-mystifications">Horkheimer’s Hegelian Mystifications?</h2> <p>The very possibility that Hegel’s thought was mystified by Horkheimer is relevant here because it is that of an effective diremption and separation (by making an artificial distinction between system and method) of what we might otherwise understand as a sublation of methodologies. Gillian Rose situates the discrepancies related to moral methodologies originally found in Adorno, which are useful for assigning a parallel case for our concern with Horkheimer and the case of the mystification of Hegel:</p> <blockquote> <p>“On the whole, both non-Marxist and Marxist sociology have mystified Hegel’s thought. […] Marxist sociology has mystified Hegel by making a distinction between a ‘radical method’ and a ‘conservative system’. As a result of this artificial distinction, the centrality of those ideas which Hegel developed to unify the theoretical and practical philosophy of Kant and Fichte has been obscured.”<d-footnote>Rose, *Hegel Contra Sociology*, 44--5.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Rose also makes a very significant point about how, “in their very different ways, both the non-Marxist and the Marxist critiques of Hegel [had attempted] to drop the notion of the ‘absolute’, but, at the same time, [had unavoidably retained] the social import of Hegel’s thought.” And how, “in the case of Marxism, the attempt depends on extracting a ‘method’ whose use will reveal social contradictions.”<d-footnote>Rose, *Hegel Contra Sociology*, 45.</d-footnote> The descriptions of the adjacent problematics that the sociologists will pose within their new methods and logic between their <em>sui generis</em> uses of Kant, Hegel, or Marx, some conservative and others more radical, support the possibility that the project of Horkheimer and his negation of morality will conform to this trend and show a tendency to mystify Hegel, but also a dependency on Kant. Rose argues that this mystification of Hegel produces an unreflected negation of morality and ethics in Adorno’s (and, for the purposes of this discussion, in Horkheimer’s) early period. In other words, these projects were firmly rooted in morality and ethics, even as they diverged from Kant’s philosophy by embracing the Marxist-Hegelian movement or, in some cases, by concealing their genuine communist (ethical-moral) perspectives. The early essays of the IfS thus appear to subsume Marx’s self-negated or “mischievous” Kantian rationale deployed against morality. Consequently, morality is separated from their project, which must not only be criticised but also slashed (dirempted) from scientific materialism. This separation is evident in the content and intent, but not the form, of their works and essays.</p> <p>However, for us, the aim to place morality as judgement and value-determining reason at the core of the critical activity of Marxism, and of the IfS’s proposed project of Marxist critical theory, is not equivalent to reinstating the conventional understanding of moralising. The objective is to rethink the function of moral value judgement as a human element of a form of sensual evaluation that transcends the context of its instrumentalisation by the bourgeoisie. As this is a case of identifying (as forensics of) ethics in Marx and consequently in Horkheimer, we will only highlight some indicative paradoxes and cite some of the arguments that can prompt further questions and studies on the potential existence of a negated yet existing moral foundation for Marxism. In order to achieve this we will examine how Horkheimer employs a dialectical and critical approach to contrasting and comparing different concepts, applying the principles of historical materialism to investigate the differences between metaphysics and materialism, and between morals and materialism.</p> <p>I will start here with Adorno as a preliminary for approaching Horkheimer. In <em>The Melancholy Science</em> – specifically the chapter “Morality and Style,” which outlines Rose’s vision of Adorno’s crypto-morals – Rose states that Adorno “shared Nietzsche’s programme of a ‘transvaluation of all values,’ ” and that, for Adorno, “ ’Morality’, ‘values’ and ‘norms’ do not imply a moral dimension distinct from other dimensions but characterise the construction and imposition of ‘reality.’ ”<d-footnote>Gillian Rose, *The Melancholy Science: An Introduction to the Thought of Theodor W. Adorno* (London and New York: Verso, 2014), 25.</d-footnote> Thus, Adorno was at this level in a position like Nietzsche’s and was ultimately, in Rose’s words, “a moralist, concerned to find a method by which his alternative moral perspective could be conveyed, but he faces the difficulties of justifying a moral position when he has apparently rejected all morality, of stating that position when he has rejected the prevalent norms of communication, and of adhering to any position at all without reaffirming the superior status of static as opposed to dynamic ways of thinking.”<d-footnote>Rose, *The Melancholy Science*, 25--6.</d-footnote> We can see with the help of Rose’s interpretation that Adorno wanted to form an “alternative moral perspective.” Without conflating Adorno and Rose with Horkheimer (and Marx), I would like to place the former very close to the case of the latter, as two authors who also addressed the question of their own (inherently bourgeois) moral perception and imperatives, and took the necessary steps to be transformed into alternative (new and negative forms of) moral perspectives. This can be proposed in a ‘constellating’ form à la Adorno, since it does not have recourse to any formal proposing of a philosophy or system for an “alternative moral perspective” for its thesis, but merely finds in the aim of conveying such alternatives the intrinsic necessity implied in a critique of morality and ethics that we find in Horkheimer. Rose explains Adorno’s stance on morality with reference to Nietzsche: “Nietzsche called one of his books by the provocative title <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, but its theme is ‘the conscience of method’. [Similarly] <em>Minima Moralia</em> is preoccupied with ‘the morality of thinking’ and with ‘morality and style.’ ”<d-footnote>Rose, *The Melancholy Science*, 26.</d-footnote> If we consider the interpretation put forth by Rose, we find that in Adorno’s <em>Minima Moralia</em> :</p> <blockquote> <p>The morality of thought lies in a procedure that is neither entrenched nor detached, neither blind nor empty, neither atomistic nor consequential. The double-edged method which has earned Hegel’s Phenomenology the reputation among reasonable people of unfathomable difficulty, that is, its simultaneous demands that phenomena be allowed to speak as such – in a ‘pure looking-on’ – and yet that their relation to consciousness as the subject, reflection, be at every moment maintained, expresses this morality most directly and in all its depth of contradiction. But how much more difficult has it become to conform to such morality now that it is no longer possible to convince oneself of the identity of subject and object, the ultimate assumption of which still enabled Hegel to conceal the antagonistic demands of observation and interpretation.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, *Minima Moralia*, trans. E. F. N. Jephcott, Radical Thinkers 1 (London and New York: Verso, 2005), 46.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Rose observes a series of inherent antinomies between value judgements and judgements of fact and, identifying (the/or a) problem of diremption in classical sociology, concludes that, “any sociology which separates judgements of fact from judgements of value is bound to be inconsistent.”<d-footnote>Rose, *The Melancholy Science,* 107.</d-footnote> She further explains that “Adorno’s point [in his critique of sociology] is not that these judgements are inseparable” but “that the very question of their separability or inseparability is illegitimate.”<d-footnote>Rose, *The Melancholy Science*, 107.</d-footnote> This error is caused by what Rose (with Adorno) defines as “identity thinking”, i.e. ”the claim to truth and the rejection of untruth of the simple logical judgement is already constituted in the procedure which the cliché allots to values separate from their base.”<d-footnote>Adorno, quoted in Rose, *The Melancholy Science*, 107.</d-footnote> Non-identity thinking, on the other hand, “is not a separable form of evaluation but ‘a concrete process of cognition where what is decided by the confrontation of the thing with what it claims to be according to its concept, is thus decided by immanent criticism.’ ”<d-footnote>Rose, *The Melancholy Science*, 107.</d-footnote> A relationality of problematics exists, which informs, causes or modifies one another under interpretation. This relationality appears as a subject to be considered when examining Horkheimer’s approach to morals.</p> <h2 id="horkheimers-negative-moral-critique-contra-the-wrong-world">Horkheimer’s Negative (Moral) Critique Contra the Wrong World</h2> <p>So far, we have situated the case and the questions that affect the issue of bourgeois morality, both in their scientific and philosophical-critical background, along with the notions and assumed conclusions and judgments on the issue of ethics and morality. Focusing on the specific case of Horkheimer, the sources and insights that triggered the idea of the paradox inherent in the critique of morality in the younger Horkheimer’s materialist social research will be unfolded. First, a series of important passages will be introduced that work in relation to those by Adorno cited above and to Horkheimer’s self versus his statements in the two essays that will be presented later.</p> <p>In Horkheimer’s case, the texts used here belong to different temporalities, and could indeed be the outcome of a process, even of a regression in his thinking. In any case, they provide interesting comparative material to help us make our case. Horkheimer was acutely aware of the problem that being openly moralistic would bring to a practising Marxist. In the fragment “Change of Thought” from <em>Dämmerung</em> (written 1926-1931), Horkheimer states that,</p> <blockquote> <p>Among Marxist thinkers, the avowal of moral motives, particularly compassion which is the secret mainspring of their thought and action, is looked down upon, not only because they are ashamed of it but also because it has been their experience that such a confession usually becomes a substitute for practice. Consciously or not, they assume that the moral impulse either manifests itself in actions or in words. That is the reason they mistrust the latter.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Change of Thought," in *Dawn &amp; Decline: Notes 1926--1931 and 1950--1969*, trans. Michael Shaw, A Continuum Book (New York: Seabury Press, 1978), 34--5.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Here Horkheimer makes it clear that for the Marxist the profession of moral motives, especially compassion, is looked down upon. He states clearly, however, that “compassion is the secret mainspring of Marxist thought and action;” and thereby brings to us the substantiation of what has always been suspected: Marxism implies a morally and ethically grounded standpoint strongly linked to both social compassion and outrage, which, as an affect, draw the subject to a not (merely) selfish solidarity in its implicit social empathy. It is particularly useful to look at its negation when considering how compassion is derided in bourgeois ethics. This theme was more fully explored in the second “Excursus” chapter of Horkheimer and Adorno’s <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, a chapter which was written by Horkheimer.<d-footnote>Gunzelin Schmid Noerr, editor's afterword to Horkheimer and Adorno, *Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments*, ed. Gunzelin Schmid Noerr, trans. Edmund Jephcott (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2002), 219--24, specifically 221--2.</d-footnote></p> <p>As we see, the case for “moral motives” as the “secret mainspring of [Marxist] thought and action, [which] is looked down upon, not only because [Marxists] are ashamed of it but also because it has been their experience that such a confession usually becomes a substitute for practice” facilitates an understanding of why, even for Horkheimer, declaring himself susceptible to morals was not considered desirable at the time when he was pushing for a Marxist methodology embedded in his project for the Institute of Social Research. It also shows why for Marx and Marxists after him, theory became categorically separated from praxis, and words in themselves became a source of mistrust.<d-footnote>One text that may assist in understanding the evolution of Marx's perspective towards a skepticism of words within the confines of theoretical and philosophical abstraction is Michael Lowy, *The Theory of Revolution in the Young Marx* (Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2005). Löwy elucidates how, for Marx, the issue was not that theory was erroneous, but rather that the preceding theses regarding the advent of socialism had to be sustained in a simultaneous and dialectical manner. With the rise of Stalin and other more radical tenets within Marxist thought, this inherent tension and adherence to the theoretical aspect within praxis was effectively nullified.</d-footnote> This can also be grasped more deeply in the issues that we know to be relevant to the implications of the disavowal of morality in Marx and Marxists, as they were for Horkheimer:</p> <blockquote> <p>When it is emphasized that there are needs and qualities other that hunger and power they point to sober reality where everything turns on the satisfaction of the most primitive needs. In so doing, they tend to transform the bitterness in that comment into an apology. Under such circumstances, the assertion that in today’s reality the ideal merely serves as ideological camouflage for a bad materialistic practice easily turns into the realism of certain journalists and reporters: “Don’t bother us with culture. We know that that’s a hoax.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Change of Thought," 35.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>A closer examination of these particular descriptions in Horkheimer’s work reveals a series of statements that illustrate the tensions and contradictions inherent in the form and methodology of a Marxist critique of morality.</p> <p>The fragment “Skepsis and Morality” shows a dynamic in which moral imperatives are mobilised by the subject who is against morals, i.e. Horkheimer. This appears in a critical and negative sense, as the unavoidable appeal to an ‘ought’ to that which is clearly explained here: “But when it is said that Marx and Engels did not “prove” socialism, not pessimism but the commitment to practice which theory needs, will follow.”<d-footnote>This passage is preceded by a description of how Marx is recuperated by academia: "One has to fight for socialism, in other words. The hedged approbation of Marxist theory, its respectful integration in the history of philosophy, is something the bourgeoisie likes to see. The correlate of this contemplative treatment of Marxism in real life is the accomodation to things as they are. To say that socialism does not"follow" from Marxist theory even though socialism is desirable, and to add nothing further, is to scientifically and morally justify capitalism. It is an expression of social skepticism." Horkheimer, "Skepsis and Morality," in *Dawn &amp; Decline: Notes 1926--1931 and 1950--1969*, trans. Michael Shaw, A Continuum Book (New York: Seabury Press, 1978), 36.</d-footnote> It is unclear if Horkheimer is citing directly from Marx here or if he is making an interpretation of what Marx had once stated, as he does not attribute the sentence “commitment to practice which theory needs” to Marx; however, we can observe how this claim to a theory that needs practice – instead of a theory that should be collapsed into practice – conveys a less divided, less bipolar understanding of what constitutes the Marxist position: the phrase “commitment to practice” manifests as arguing for the separation of practice from theory, and in the following words, such separation is repaired, with “practice which theory needs” – both propositions become ‘mischievously’ relational.<d-footnote>The phrase "practice which theory needs..." is probably an allusion to the works of the young Marx. For a work which summarises the young Marx's philosophy and thereby confirms this similarity with Horkheimer, see Lowy's aforementioned *The Theory of Revolution in the Young Marx*, 10-13.</d-footnote></p> <p>Horkheimer further expands on the connection or bipolarity implied in the position of scepticism versus morality; his remarks are worth quoting at length:</p> <blockquote> <p>What the transition from one part of a system to another is for the bourgeois scholar, a “problem” like so many others, something to which “justice can be done” on a few sympathetic pages in a textbook, i.e., the resolution of the question whether class society continues or is successfully replaced by socialism, is something that will decide if mankind progresses or perishes in barbarism. The position a person takes here not only determines the relationship of his life to that of mankind but also the degree of his morality. A philosophical system, an ethic, a moral teaching which merely treats our outdated, progress-inhibiting property relations, the existence of a class society and the need to transcend it as “part of a larger picture” rather than identifying itself with that need is the opposite of morality, for the form morality has taken in our time is the implementation of socialism.[… ] [Bourgeois professors and literari] calmly look on the legal rape of countless children, women and men in capitalist societies and even more in their colonies, and ingest their share of the loot.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Skepsis and Morality,", 36--7.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>What the core of the paragraph above reveals is not a mere digression, but a defining assertion, namely that “the form morality has taken in our time is the implementation of socialism.” If this was written between 1926 and 1931, what do we make of the “form” of morality that implied the socialist project? As we know, following Rolf Wiggershaus, in the 20s and 30s the proposal of a new interdisciplinary methodology such as that of sociology, especially when based on Marxist curricula, was practically and materially considered to be socialist.<d-footnote>Rolf Wiggershaus, *The Frankfurt School: Its History, Theories and Political Significance*, trans. Michael Robertson, repr. (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2007), 15 et passim..</d-footnote></p> <p>In the fragment “Two Aspects of Materialism,” we can find the left-wing, critical Marxist moral perspective by looking at some of its imperatives: “Tolerance – since everything has to be the way it is – protest against everything being the way it has to be.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Two Aspects of Materialism," in *Dawn &amp; Decline: Notes 1926--1931 and 1950--1969*, trans. Michael Shaw, A Continuum Book (New York: Seabury Press, 1978), 139.</d-footnote> To gain further insight into Horkheimer’s perspective, it is useful to examine a number of significant preliminary critiques that can be found in both the 1968 preface to the volume <em>Critical Theory</em> and his short 1932 essay “Notes on Science and The Crisis.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis," in *Critical Theory: Selected Essays*, trans. Matthew J. O'Connell (New York: Continuum, 1975), 3--9.</d-footnote> As he lets us know in the retrospective 1968 preface, “metaphysical pessimism, always an implicit element in every genuine materialist philosophy, had always been congenial to [him].”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, preface to *Critical Theory: Selected Essays*, trans. Matthew J. O'Connell (New York: Continuum, 1975), ix.</d-footnote> We may continue this look into Horkheimer’s moral perspective as it relates to metaphysics by considering his lament over the field’s neglect of temporally situated social facts: “Metaphysics thereby turned its back on the causes of the social crisis and even downgraded the means of investigating it. It introduced a new confusion of its own by hypostatizing isolated, abstractly conceived man and thereby belittling the importance of a theoretical comprehension of social processes.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis," 7.</d-footnote> Here we can observe how metaphysics is negatively interpellated by a moral (critical admonition) for what it has positively betrayed. But metaphysics is not a person or a subject, it is a field and also a state of being, and as such it is represented by its proponents. Metaphysics is, in principle, open to all of us; it is a way of perceiving and sensing. Thus metaphysics, as it stands accused, is represented only by those metaphysicians who, by virtue of their ideological alliances, have betrayed their responsibility to come to terms with the social crisis. This situation may or may not have lasted, and it may very well be that at some point in our history, a series of new metaphysics will intensify the commitment to the social to levels not yet seen in Horkheimer’s time. In “Materialism and Metaphysics,” Horkheimer explores the broader problem of the subsumption of the sciences and philosophy by ideology. The following paragraphs make the problem very clear and allow us to easily decipher it today as the prototypical neoliberal ethos:</p> <blockquote> <p>The idea of unbroken harmony between reality and reason belongs to the liberalist phase. It corresponds to a social economy marked by a plurality of individual entrepreneurs. The image of their interests as harmonizing and producing a frictionless functioning of the whole economy was applied to society as a whole and its various social classes. The monopolistic phase goes even further in denying class conflicts, but the struggle in the world market between a few power groups has become so much the principal theme of the period that instead of harmony between individuals, such concepts as tragedy, heroism, and destiny have come to be the main categories for a philosophy of history. The material interests of individuals are considered unimportant, something less to be fulfilled than to be overcome.<d-footnote>Horkheimer "Materialism and Metaphysics," 12--3.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Exactly as it is criticised and exposed by Horkheimer here, we can find a resonance in the critique of neoliberal morals proposed by Jessica Whyte in <em>The Morals of the Market</em>, where she makes clear the connection between these philosophies of human harmony and manifest destiny as an alibi for the neoliberals’ ability to get away with the criminal aspect of their policies.<d-footnote>Whyte offers a great study for reflecting on the double morality waged by the neoliberals since their origins. Her study provides us with a comparative material of how morals and rights are used perversely by the neoliberal rhetoric. It also hints at the idea of how Marxsim by having disavowed morality and ethics, found itself dry, for arguments to oppose those morals of the market, as it was easily accused of mere totalitarianism.</d-footnote></p> <p>The case that Horkheimer makes against metaphysics is a critique of its idealisation of and bias towards figures of authority based on their longevity and the greatness of the past. It is not explicitly stated, but the authors and tendencies criticised in his essay may be the conservative, perennial values we tend to see in academia. In Horkheimer’s essays, a very present and saturated signifier of what morality means is at work, and it is accused of being a mere by-product of bourgeois thought. However, this is difficult to assess without looking at the possible origins of these misrecognitions, displacements, and self-obscurations in relation to the interpretation of morality. If we consider the general arguments put forth by Neo-Kantian socialists such as Herman Cohen, we can discern how they appear to originate in Hegel’s critique of Kant’s concept of the divided subject and its principles of non-contradiction, which were subsequently adopted by Marx and other Marxists. For us, morality is not just a set of rigid bourgeois conventions. Morality since Kant, however complicated by Hegel’s critique, involves the possibility of conflicting discourses and principles in different senses and contains the possibility of activating emancipation, revolution, and social change for the ‘best.’ However, this is not a majoritarian view of morality, especially among Marxist theorists. In the contemporary globalised society, ‘morality’ has transcended its traditional field of explicit value judgements to include the kind of position that rejects value judgements.</p> <p>This brings us back to the question of the materialist rejection of value judgements and the autonomous subject of subjectivity, which in any case tells us that the so-called moral sciences, implicit in what should or should not be accepted as right or good, are never one-sided or even double-sided. Returning to Freud’s work here is necessary, especially to his treatment of negation and denial in “Die Verneinung,” where the processes by which the analysand’s dogged subjectivity is committed to negating what is otherwise obvious for the therapist and analyst.<d-footnote>Sigmund Freud, "Negation (1925)," in *The Ego and the Id and Other Works: 1923--1925*, trans. James Strachey, The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, vol. 19 (London: Vintage, 2001), 235--43.</d-footnote> This means that by insisting on the separation and negation of morality, Horkheimer’s attitude of “no, I am not a moralist, no, I am not interested in morality, and no, morality is wrong and materialism is right,” reproduces the same mechanisms exposed in Freud’s seminal text.</p> <h2 id="the-divided-morals-of-critical-theory">The Divided Morals of Critical Theory</h2> <p>Horkheimer declares his Hegelianism by making clear that the problem with theory is separation, compartmentalisation, and abstractedness and its telling parallelism to the “empty form of philosophy” characteristic of positivism. As he states, “Hegel himself […] did not separate truth and knowledge from the temporal; on the contrary—and this is the secret of his depth of thought—he made knowledge of the temporal as temporal the content of philosophy.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Metaphysics," 38.</d-footnote> In this instance, we may discern the integration of Hegel’s elemental shift towards the unity of space and time within the Marxian perspective. This enables the realisation of a historical understanding that is not an abstraction but rather situated within the concrete dimensions of actuality and social contextualisation.</p> <p>This section will examine how Horkheimer employs the Hegelian technique of presenting historically situated accounts of social phenomena in order to elucidate his own materialist perspective. A core value judgement related to the present, which represents the Hegelian actuality and unity of space and time for Horkheimer, is his statement on his negative standpoint, “I can say what is wrong, but I cannot say what is right.” This dictum demonstrates that a value judgement (“what is wrong”) carries within it the raison d’être of the Marxist methodologies that form part of Critical Theory. This precise locating of a ‘here and now’ or a ‘then and there’ described as “wrong” appears as a moral imperative for an autonomous mode of action.</p> <p>The modern break from the religious mode of authority and the production of a self-regulating subject of a higher social class that organises and divides taxonomically the social realm is introduced in Horkheimer’s “Materialism and Morality” as capable of claiming an unchallenged unconditional validity<em>.</em> The ‘use utility’ for those principles, as Horkheimer writes, is bound to be for “a rationally grounded morality (…) all the more necessary to dominate the masses in the state when a mode of action diverging from their life interests was demanded of them.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 16. The notion of 'use utility' is mine, here to highlight an instrumentalisation as utility, thus use of modes of evaluating such as what will entail a realm of unconditional validity in Ethics and Morals.</d-footnote> Horkheimer’s reference to the masses as subjects to be dominated and to a will induced – plastically/psychically/ideologically and via forms of legality – for a self-regulating morality, is a point of departure when looking at Horkheimer’s essay “Materialism and Morality.” It acknowledges the dominated masses as subjects who are subjected to the power of a master minority class that no longer engages in direct physical combat, as with the previous Hegelian form of the master and slave, and how, instead, this minority class has become a unified force of domination against the (collectivised and politicised) mass of subjugated peoples.</p> <p>Horkheimer’s pointing at morality as equal to religion for mediating an ideology that translates into a “mode of action diverging from their life interest,” like that of following the Ten Commandments, shows how it is so objectively required that focusing on the moral as a sublated religion needed to be conceptually crushed. Under this pressure and this emergency, one forgets to establish the notion that ours is also a moral judgement, a critical moral judgement that claims its legitimacy against the religious element in the moral instance. Hence the confusion regarding the various interpretations of Kant and Hegel here, because, as we will see further down, Kant can be brought back as a thinker of revolution.<d-footnote>It is worth paying attention to the actual discourses and proposal of Lea Ypi, which add comparative weight to previous works by Furner et al.</d-footnote> Understanding the pressures of a given time and its implicit ideology helps us to see the reason for such rejection of morality and the need to escape and avoid it when working towards a materialist understanding of the project of Critical Theory. One possibility is that, due to its historical proximity to the still very active and ever-present bourgeois order from which Horkheimer et al. hoped to escape, it became paramount for the project to draw strong lines of demarcation from which morality, as identified with religion and bourgeois instrumental reason, had to be correspondingly negated.<br> The concept of negation is one thesis to be followed in order to assess how limited the potential for acknowledging its moral imperatives was for the task of Critical Theory at the time. Another thesis will be the absolute identification of morality with its satiated signifier, to a point where it is not possible “not to be against” it, intending to retrieve it for other purposes. In Hegel’s critique of Kant from “The Scientific Ways of Treating Natural Law, its Place in Moral Philosophy, and its Relation to the Positive Sciences of Law,” we see how Hegel develops a series of concepts against Kant’s Morals as that of his “rational immoralism.” Identifying the dialectical inversion at work in Hegel when he regards Kant’s formalist principles as perverse, deceptive, and immoral would be fundamental to understanding the set of problematics inherited by Marx and Marxism against morals, ethics, and morality more broadly. For Hegel, Kant’s moral categories are a form of sophistry by which all sorts of rules of wickedness (once abstracted) can be adopted and justified on the grounds that they are not self-contradictory, and that thus “something specific” can be made into a categorically imperative duty.<d-footnote>G. W. F. Hegel, *Natural Law (The Scientific Ways of Treating Natural Law, Its Place in Moral Philosophy, and Its Relation to the Positive Sciences of Law)*, Translated by T. M. Knox; Introduction by H. B. Acton. (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1975.) 109--10.</d-footnote></p> <p>Horkheimer, too, advises us to take the side of materialism against Kant and his idealist, Enlightenment utopia. When these articles were written in the early 1930s, he argued for the necessity of superseding the utopian flavour of theoretical social morals: “The materialist theory of society is needed as a means to supersede the utopian character of the Kantian conception of a perfect constitution.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 27.</d-footnote> This advice contains in itself a complex dialectical reaction to morals, making it clearer for us that for Horkheimer materialism is a direct response to a reified and fixed idea of what morals are:</p> <blockquote> <p>After all, the disparate interests of the individual are not ultimate facts; they do not have their basis in an independent psychological constitution, rather they are based on both the material relations and the real total situation of the social group to which the individual belongs. The absolutely incommensurable disparity of interests derives from the disparity of the relations of ownership; human beings today stand against one another as functions of various economic powers, of which each reveals to the others contradictory developmental tendencies.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 27--8.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Horkheimer follows these indications by bringing up Kant’s organismic dreams of society perfected by reason, a gesture that recalls Marx’s critique of the abstract character of Kant’s thought and the emptiness of its proposed structures, which are then filled by the now common and obviously false world of actuality:</p> <blockquote> <p>Kant employs the image of the organism in order to indicate the frictionless functioning of the future society; nothing in this suggests the faintest denial of the role of rational thought. Today, by contrast, the image of the organism characterizes a system of dependency and economic inequality, one which can no longer justify itself before the world’s expanded critical understanding and which therefore requires metaphysical phrases in order to reconcile people to it.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 28.</d-footnote><em> </em></p> </blockquote> <p>We can grasp from this Horkheimer’s reasons for criticising the use of the concept of organism to promote social inequality and dependency. We can also discern in Horkheimer’s words a backhandedly positive view of what Kant was originally doing. For von Mises, on the contrary,</p> <blockquote> <p>A society is only possible if everyone, while living his own life, at the same time helps others to live, if every individual is simultaneously means and end; if each individual’s well-being is simultaneously the condition necessary to the well-being of the others, it is evident that the contrast between I and thou, means and end, automatically is overcome. This, after all, is just what the simile of the biological organism is supposed to make us perceive. In the organic structure no parts are to be regarded only as means and none only as ends. According to Kant the organism is a being ‘in which everything is end and reciprocally also means’. Now Kant was thoroughly familiar with the nature of the organic, but he did not see – and in this he lagged far behind the great sociologists who were his contemporaries – that human society is formed according to the same principle.<d-footnote>von Mises, *Socialism*, 432.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>There is indeed no better way to understand the hostile, antagonistic interpretations of Kant, Hegel, Marx (and Horkheimer by extension) than having a close reading of the arguments (akin to psychological warfare) put forward by such a nemesis as von Mises.</p> <p>Returning to the topic at hand, this close connection between the concept of organism and that of reason in society echoes the young Marx’s concept of man as a species being. Marx believed in the conditions of possibility for the evolution of society towards a communist community, as defined in <em>The German Ideology</em>.<d-footnote>"The transformation, through the division of labour, of personal powers (relationships) into material powers, cannot be dispelled by dismissing the general idea of it from one's mind, but can only be abolished by the individuals again subjecting these material powers to themselves and abolishing the division of labour. This is not possible without the community. Only in community [with others has each] individual the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions; only in the community, therefore, is personal freedom possible. In the previous substitutes for the community, in the State, etc. personal freedom has existed only for the individuals who developed within the relationships of the ruling class, and only insofar as they were individuals of this class. The illusory community, in which individuals have up till now combined, always took on an independent existence in relation to them, and was at the same time, since it was the combination of one class over against another, not only a completely illusory community, but a new fetter as well. In a real community the individuals obtain their freedom in and through their association.", *Marx and Engels: 1845-47. German Idealogy*, vol. Vol 5, Collected Works (London: Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1976), 171.</d-footnote> The very opposite happens in Horkheimer’s eyes, as the “organism is drawn into the matter in order to rationalise as an eternal relationship based on blind nature the fact that certain people make decisions and certain others carry them out, a state of affairs which the growth of all forces has made questionable.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 28.</d-footnote> Materialism, on the other hand, “attempts to delineate […] the actual relationships from which the moral problem derives, and which are reflected, if only in a distorted fashion, in the doctrines of moral philosophy.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 21.</d-footnote> Thus we can conclude that Horkheimer already claims two things at once: 1) there are, in fact, “actual relationships” which give rise to moral problems, and so we are still always immersed in actualised moral problems; 2) “moral problems are reflected, if only in distorted fashion, in the doctrines of moral philosophy,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 21.</d-footnote> – ergo the problems are implicitly located in the context or field of a moral philosophy that we inherit and have to grapple with.</p> <p>Horkheimer, coming full circle, then states that, “the idea of morality, as it was formulated by Kant, contains the truth that the mode of action informed by the natural law of economic advantage is not necessarily the rational mode.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 21.</d-footnote> The fact that the possibility of a moral-legal principle, such as that of “economic advantage,” stemming from a divided and divisive structure consolidated by the doctrine of natural law, is considered irrational in its “mode of action” is an extremely important point in relation to the critique of political economy and its ideology, especially in neo-liberal form. It can be suggested that the irrational origin of such reasoning for economic advantage is cynical or deranged, thus making possible a moral critique of the case of the unequal set-up reproducing itself through a moral mode of action. This points to an internal crisis of the field of morality, intersecting with law and jurisprudence. The crisis in turn poses the problem of an origin that asserts itself in irrationality in order to be later developed as rational under the “idea of morality,” thus showing us the basis of what makes false morality work.</p> <p>Following this, Horkheimer claims that “Whoever is in the economic situation of the bourgeois and is incapable of experiencing this whole conflict [of individual interests] has not kept pace developmentally, and lacks a type of reaction belonging to individuals of this period.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 21.</d-footnote> This statement is organised as a moral judgement against the bourgeois consciousness; however, it does not recognise itself as such. Perhaps what follows explains why this is the case:</p> <blockquote> <p>Morality, therefore, is by no means simply dismissed by materialism as mere ideology in the sense of false consciousness. Rather, it must be understood as a human phenomenon that cannot possibly be overcome for the duration of the bourgeois epoch. Its philosophical expression, however, is distorted in many respects. Above all, the solution of the problem does not lie in the observance of rigidly formulated commandments.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 22.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Horkheimer recognises that there is a problem, a conflict, which cannot be resolved by observing strict, rigid commandments, but he also recognises that the problem is temporally bound.</p> <p>We can judge the power of this idealistic and rigid metaphysics by its call for a mobilisation of stoicism, because this is the morality that the capitalists and the neo-liberals who followed them have managed to plant everywhere, somehow winning on the correlation of forces between stoicism and solidarity. The notion of rigid commandments, which appear as cold Kantian oughts, reveals a misconception about the possibility of morality. Here is what Horkheimer thinks about the categorical imperative:</p> <blockquote> <p>“In the attempt to actually apply the Kantian imperative, it immediately becomes clear that the general interest the moral will is concerned about would not be helped in the least. Even if everyone were to comply with the imperative, even if everyone were to lead a virtuous life in its sense, the same confusion would continue to reign. Nothing essential would be changed.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 22.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>One of the overt concepts mobilised by the neo-liberal credo is freedom, which departs blindly and abstractly from necessity. This kind of freedom is also mobilised by the discourses that sustain fascism, past and present.<br> In fascism too, then, freedom appears as a Kantian imperative, completely devoid of context and totally self-serving as a mere abstract principle. The capitalist, bourgeois, fascist, and neo-liberal notion that necessity should be evacuated along with the social context and the notion of a free association of individuals is also a key issue. Horkheimer illustrates the moral implications of the submission not only to the economy but also to the laws and categories implicit in the reproduction of a dominated class:</p> <blockquote> <p>The acquisition of moral principles was important for members of the higher social strata, since their position constantly demanded that they make intervening decisions which they had earlier been absolved of by authority. At the same time, a rationally grounded morality became all the more necessary to dominate the masses in the state when a mode of action diverging from their life interests was demanded of them.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 16.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>We can see, following the critique of Kantian morality that Marxists maintain – keeping in mind the self-denial pointed out by Furner – that the problem with Kantian, rationally-based morality is its potential for an abstraction that can be applied in both directions: to the self-regulation of a particular class (here the bourgeoisie) and the domination of the masses (as a produced and reproduced class). The double-edged quality of the Copernican turn and system was further explored by Horkheimer and Adorno in <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, as the work produces a scenario pitting Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Marx against each other in a dialectical critique of Kantian reason.<d-footnote>Horkheimer and Adorno, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="the-crisis-in-the-critique-of-morals">The Crisis in the Critique of Morals</h2> <p>In his critique of metaphysics, Horkheimer largely focuses on Jaspers’s and Dilthey’s historical and psychological typology of worldviews to diagnose what is wrong with the separation from the absolutised categories of the Kantian legacy of bourgeois liberal thought. The important thing for our current discussion, however, is Horkheimer’s analysis of bourgeois liberalism, which depicts the classical denial and negation that follows the bourgeois liberal consciousness when it becomes a false consciousness and a totalising metaphysical system: “…bourgeois liberalism voices its critique of the claim to absoluteness made by its own thinking […] The equality of rank given to various metaphysical ideas and the awareness of their radical historical conditioning are proof of a high degree of detachment from the power of categories originally absolutized by bourgeois liberal thought.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Metaphysics," 11.</d-footnote> Horkheimer points at a lack of “knowledge of the social conditions governing [the] elaboration” of such absolutised categories and of their present historical relativisation, of what abstracted categorical tropes are used in a hypostatised form as “concepts of man, life, personality, and creative development”, to advance the self-divided thesis of these metaphysicians, with the results of a “partial liberation from the particular ideas of the past” in which “the forms of world view and their transformations [are] themselves now clothed in the glorious garments of the metaphysical process.”  The separation and abstraction from the social conditions that govern such “absolutised categories,” a concept central to liberal metaphysics, is observed by Horkheimer through the lens of a Marxist materialist paradigm. This approach allows for a critical examination of the complex relations of class power involved in the self-reification of the concept.</p> <p>The negation of morals in Horkheimer called the attention of Eric Oberle, who in his work <em>Theodor Adorno and The Century of Negative Identity</em> explains that, in the 1930s and 40s, “the Frankfurt School theorists were engaged in defending the scientific value of metaphysical reflection and in criticising all theories of truth as adaptation, Pragmatism included.”<d-footnote>Eric Oberle, *Theodor Adorno and the Century of Negative Identity*, Cultural Memory in the Present (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2018), 89.</d-footnote> He shows how Horkheimer, well ahead of Adorno, had already “warned against the attempt to naturalise metaphysics.” Quoting the essay “Materialism and Metaphysics,” Oberle explains that Horkheimer argued “that science undermined itself if it insisted that all events and experiences could be explained naturalistically.” Rather, for Oberle, it is Horkheimer’s insistence which had “merely placed a taboo on metaphysical and moral questions rather than answering them.”<d-footnote>Oberle, *The Century of Negative Identity*, 89.</d-footnote> The question addressed here is precisely that of this tabooing of morals and metaphysics by Horkheimer; this tabooing shows that a problematic dynamic resides in the field of Marxist theory when tackling morals and ethics.</p> <p>As some contemporary scholars have observed in the context of the Frankfurt School, albeit focused on Adorno, their praxis challenged the very foundations of their own critiques, as they employed a transdisciplinary approach to examine the complex issue of political economy.<d-footnote>See Bonefeld, eds., *Adorno and Marx: Negative Dialectics and the Critique of Political Economy*, Critical Theory and the Critique of Society Series (London and New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2022).</d-footnote> One illustrative example here is the following claim from Horkheimer: “The absolutely incommensurable disparity of interests derives from the disparity of the relations of ownership; human beings today stand against one another as functions of various economic powers, of which each reveals to the others contradictory developmental tendencies.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 28.</d-footnote> Horkheimer’s analysis of the whole trajectory of a morality based on an “irrational principle” originating in natural law around property, economic status, or advantage shows his concern to expose the fallacy of said ‘bourgeois morality’ built on and around property rights.</p> <p>This leads us directly to the later developments of neoliberalism and its discourses (based on rights and libertarian morals of the market) and how its highly skilled technocrats have based their success on a great instrumentalisation of jurisprudential ethics with narratives charged with revolutionary morals that only recognize freedom and never commit to duty.<d-footnote>It is relevant here to relate this insight to Horkheimer's statements about freedom vs. justice in Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 37--8.</d-footnote> As we have focused on finding the moral core at the heart of Critical Theory in Horkheimer’s critique of morality and metaphysics, a basic thing to do here will be to go back to his injunction that we live in a wrong, false world. But what is the normative ground that mediates this notion of wrongness?</p> <p>If we take Horkheimer’s need for a Critical Theory in a world about which he will only state what is “wrong” as the basis for his direction, focus, and choice of issues to explicate and critique, then it is not possible for us to say that Horkheimer has successfully avoided being influenced by a very strong moral motivation and judgement.<d-footnote>Horkheimer also states that "[i]nstead, even in the face of pessimistic assessments, critical theory is guided by the unswerving interest in a better future," at Horkheimer, "Montaigne and the Function of Skepticism," in *Critical Theory: Selected Essays*, trans. Matthew J. O'Connell (New York: Continuum, 1975), 309--10.</d-footnote> Understanding the problem of – or at least problematising the lack of knowledge about – the social conditions that govern the elaboration of philosophical-historical or sociological categories is here the basis for Marxist politics and praxis. It is also a way by which a form of practical thinking suited for Critical Theory could come about. As we can see, Horkheimer’s materialism sets up as an oppositive normative ground that also reproduces the Kantian moves – along with the necessary Hegelian ones – when he attempts to ground it by locating “the normative basis of materialism in its immediate recognition of the validity [a value judgement] of feelings of solidarity and compassion and the hope for a better society.”<d-footnote>For example, Loralea Ann Michaelis: "In particular, what is lacking is a full appreciation of the ambivalence that was incorporated into the early formulation of critical theory over providing rational justification for the impulse toward a better society which the theory articulates. [...] Horkheimer's leading position in determining the theoretical policy of the Zeitschrift, specifying the normative ground of critical theory finds its limit in a reconstructed understanding of Marxism as a 'critical materialism' fundamentally opposed to all forms of metaphysics, into which attempts to provide ultimate justification for norms are seen to inevitably degenerate" Loralea Ann Michaelis, "The Limits of Justification: Max Horkheimer's Critical Materialism, 1931--1937" (Master's thesis, University of Toronto, 1989), 6.</d-footnote></p> <p>The understanding of moral principles predicates the normative grounds behind (moral and ethical) feelings of solidarity in the face of human suffering due to wars under the regime of the military industrial complex, naturalised global famine, mass homelessness, modern slavery, and new forms of class warfare. Those are necessary when Critical Theory is deployed to argue in (Marxist) social and political critiques. This is where James Furner’s argument or defence that there is an ethics inherent in Marx’s work may apply:</p> <p>[…] viewed as an argument against all morality, the ideology argument is self-undermining. This is because any proponent of the ideology argument must acknowledge that there is an impartial reason to institute social arrangements that reduce or eliminate false consciousness. Yet this is to acknowledge an impartial reason, the very quality that is said to make moral motivations ideological. One cannot argue against all morality by appeal to an argument that commits to a moral claim.<d-footnote>James Furner, *Rescuing Autonomy from Kant*, 16.</d-footnote>     </p> <p>The question here is what way of thinking involves the objective of exposing a negative (wrong, false) reality implicated in the so-called totality of the world? What way of thinking would be necessary for the subject and its critical collective formations to deal with a (negative) truth against which they will all work or even die for?<d-footnote>This is reflected upon in the following quote, "Thought" in Adorno and Horkheimer's *Dialectic of Enlightenment*: "For this reason, nor only is the utterance which attacks power found intolerable but the one which gropes forward experimentally, playing with the possibility of error. Yet to be unfinished: and to know it is the mark even of the thought which opposes power, and especially of the thought for which it would be worth dying." Horkheimer, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, 203.</d-footnote> Was Horkheimer’s Critical Theory, as a form of Marxist materialism, able to get rid of the syntaxis of the moral claim and the value judgement? Or did he unavoidably depended on both when arguing against all morality by appealing to an argument that committed to moral claims? Reading Horkheimer’s “Materialism and Morality” retrospectively, as we have just done, we find a barely perceptible yet evolved critical and aporetic conjuncture when defining bourgeois stoic moral practices as those of acceptance before catastrophe instead of the mobilising of a moral sentiment aimed at liberation. But were Horkheimer’s (moral) apprehensions at his own conclusion that the global scale of class division and catastrophe was like “the fall of antiquity” for our society indebted to a Kantian notion of <em>Aufklärung</em>?<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Materialism and Morality," 35.</d-footnote><d-footnote>For further explorations of the connectivity between Kantian, Hegelian, and Marxian methods in Horkheimer, see Horkheimer, "Traditional and Critical Theory"; "Postscript" ; and "The Social Function of Philosophy," in *Critical Theory: Selected Essays*, trans. Matthew J. O'Connell (New York: Continuum, 1975), 188--243, 244--52, and 253--72, respectively.</d-footnote> And, was this (moral) denial and rejection of morals a common thread between what Horkheimer had praised and the amoral neoliberal doctrine? The issue remains whether the (Marxist) disavowal of morals as a field upon which to fight moralism and its false, wrong aspects on its own terms is truly possible or radically necessary.</p> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Adorno, Theodor W. <em>Minima Moralia</em>.
