Robert C. Tucker (Norton, 1978), 84.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>I’ve never read an account of the socio-historical determination of philosophy that fully satisfied me. There always seems to be some level of mediation missing, some level of distortion or sleight of hand at play in the explanatory framework. This problem really crystallized for me when I read and presented on Marcuse’s essay “The Concept of Essence” with the Critical Theory Working Group last fall. The way it subsumed the history of philosophy under its gaze thrilled me at the same time as it set off alarm bells in the back of my mind. Its attack on the ahistorical pretensions of philosophy appealed to the historical materialist in me and its systematic account of Marxism as a theory of essence appealed to the philosopher in me. At the same time, I had a nagging sense that something was amiss on both counts, and I couldn’t really see how it all fit together. As I continued to engage with it, I began to suspect that the specter of totalization, which had been part of the essay’s initial appeal, covered over a number of confusions and deficiencies that prevented it from fulfilling the promises that I had originally read into it. These promises are of 1) a historical materialist account of the origins and development of the concept of essence that grounds both in the social conditions from which they arose and 2) a marxist theory of essence that facilitates the project of revolutionary praxis in the present day. I still believe that attempting to fulfill these promises is a worthwhile project, although one that (perhaps predictably) cannot be completed within the bounds of a single essay. With that in mind, I will focus here on laying the groundwork for that larger project, using Marcuse’s essay as a jumping-off point for developing my own historical materialist account of the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in Ancient Greece.<d-footnote>I do not mean to claim that this emergence represented the absolute origins of the concept of essence in a world historical sense, but rather to take it as an example of the emergence of that concept from out of a milieu in which it had previously been absent (and one that appears to have been foundational for the tradition we refer to as Western or European philosophy).</d-footnote></p> <p>In Part 1, I will begin with a critical examination of Marcuse’s account of the historical development of essence and the reasons for its failure to realize what it set out to achieve. I will argue that the most important of these reasons involve a formalist interpretive apparatus and the subsumption of the historical materialist elements in his work under an idealist philosophy of history, which lead him to neglect the concrete socio-historical conditions under which the concept of essence emerged in Ancient Greece. After that I will address the work of Alfred Sohn-Rethel, which bears some superficial similarities to the investigation undertaken here, but shares many of the problems that plagued Marcuse’s account, and use the discussion of his work as an opportunity to further distinguish my project from both of theirs.</p> <p>In Part 2, I will begin my reconstruction of the social determination of the emergence of the concept of essence in Ancient Greece, starting with the pre-history of the concept of essence. This will involve 1) an examination of what I will call the bardic conception of truth and its situation within an earlier mode of production centered around the warrior-aristocracy depicted in the Homeric epics 2) an account of how the reciprocal dynamic of commercialization and the centralization of slavery within the mode of exploitation, along with changes in the practice of warfare, created a crisis of the traditional warrior aristocracy and the mode of production centered on them, which set the stage for the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in Pre-Socratic Monism (PSM) and 3) a concluding examination of the works Theognis of Megara and the transitional conception of truth developed in them, which bears marks of both the bardic conception that preceded it and the concept of essence that followed it.</p> <p>In Part 3, I will turn to PSM itself and its relation to the changes described in the preceding section. First, I will offer an examination and critique of Richard Seaford’s account of the origins of PSM and its relation to the money form as a result of what he calls “unconscious cosmological projection.” Then, I will elucidate my own positive account of the origins and development of PSM in terms of its ideological function in response to the aristocratic and social crises of the Archaic period and the inability of its proponents to recognize the latent content of the money form as an externalization of the total social labor that posits both the equality of labor and its thoroughgoing interdependence.</p> <p>Finally, in Part 4 I will discuss the methodological, historical and practical implications of the preceding reconstruction, with an eye to the larger project set out in this introduction.</p> <p>There are also two appendices attached to this essay, the first of which details the methodological background that underlies the arguments presented in the body of the essay, and the second of which provides a more concrete reconstruction of the relevant historical developments that took place between the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces and the consolidation of the <em>poleis</em> in the Archaic. The second in particular is important for putting the developments discussed in Part 2 in their proper perspective and justifying a number of the claims made there.</p> <h2 id="1-the-problem-of-historical-reconstruction">1. The Problem of Historical Reconstruction</h2> <h3 id="marcuses-position-11">Marcuse’s Position (1.1)</h3> <p>My beginning this piece with an examination of Marcuse’s essay “The Concept of Essence” is in some sense a nod to the biographical origins of the investigation I am undertaking here. It was his essay that sent me down the path that culminated in the writing of the essay you are reading now. So, if you’ll allow me to be a little loose with my terms, beginning in this way can be seen as an attempt to leave somewhat ajar the doors of the hidden abode of production whose product stands before you in the form of a finished work; Or, in a more Hegelian vein, to lay bare the process of mediation without which the result would appear as a bare immediacy stripped of its full meaning and conceptual content. To properly elucidate the concepts developed here, the conceptual and methodological problems in Marcuse’s essay that served as their origin must themselves be taken back up into their exposition, and so I must begin with an account of Marcuse’s position. At the same time, it should be understood that the primary purpose of this essay is not the evaluation of that position, but rather the development of an account of the emergence of the concept of essence and its socio-historical determination, which, despite inheriting its object and certain animating problems from Marcuse’s account, rests on different principles, principles that could be said to represent the determinate negation of those that Marcuse’s essay is founded on. In this sense, Marcuse’s position is only a starting point, but it is nevertheless an essential starting point.</p> <p>At first glance, Marcuse’s essay has the appearance of offering a historical materialist account of the emergence and development of the concept of essence (and to some extent it does do so, as we’ll see below). It is framed as an attempt to show how “even [the] loftiest conceptions of philosophy are subject to historical development,” and how “so much of men’s real struggles and desires went into the metaphysical quest for an ultimate unity, truth, and universality of Being that they could not have failed to find expression in the derived forms of the philosophical tradition.”<d-footnote>Herbert Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," in _Negations: Essays in Critical Theory_, trans. Jeremy Shapiro (Mayfly Books, 2009), 31.</d-footnote> This suggests that the project Marcuse is pursuing is an attempt to demonstrate the validity of the basic historical materialist postulate that “it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_, trans. S.W. Ryazanskaya (Progress Publishers, 1977), Preface.</d-footnote> But, upon closer examination, this framing already reveals the deficiencies of his project from the perspective of a genuine, dialectical conception of historical materialism.</p> <p>The first way in which it does so is by restricting the scope of the socio-historical determination of thought. In order to account for the apparent invariance of the <em>content</em> of the concept of essence, which he glosses as “the abstraction and isolation of the one true Being from the constantly changing multiplicity of appearances,” Marcuse argues that it is the “<em>position and function</em> [of such concepts] within philosophical systems” [italics mine] that is subject to change.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 31.</d-footnote> It is therefore to the position and function of the concept of essence that we should look to understand its socio-historical determination. But, this division between an invariant content and a historically determined position and function already concedes too much to the idealist position Marcuse is trying to argue against, abstracting and isolating the content of the concept from the realm of historical explanation and positing it as an eternal, transcendent content whose origins are either obscure or unknowable.</p> <p>The obscurity of the origins of this transcendent content creates a number of problems for the beginning of Marcuse’s historical account. Without the ability to give a historical explanation of the origins of the content of the concept of essence, he is forced to posit its emergence as an external bringing-together of independently pre-existing determinations (or of the philosophical problems that underlie them).<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 32.</d-footnote> He argues that it is the bringing-together of the “epistemological” determinations of unity, universality and abstraction with the determination of truth—understood as distinguishing between hierarchically ordered levels of reality—that provides essence with its “critical and ethical elements” and so with its primary function within Plato’s philosophy, which is to establish a “critical gap” between what is and what could or should be.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33. As we shall see in Part 2, there is a notion of truth that pre-exists the emergence of the concept of essence, but it is not until that emergence occurs that it takes on the determination Marcuse attributes to it.</d-footnote> He doesn’t explain where these determinations, or the problems that form their “philosophical substratum,” themselves arise from, or why they are brought together to form the concept of essence, outside of some quasi-mystical and ultimately tautological talk of a “quest for the unity and universality of Being in view of the multiplicity and changeability of beings.”<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 32--3.</d-footnote> It is as if, for Marcuse, the Ancient Greeks already had a notion of essence preconceived in their heads before they went searching for it.</p> <p>If there <em>is</em> an invariance in certain elements of the concept of essence, or of any other metaphysical category—which does have a certain plausibility given a cursory look at the history of philosophy—then that invariance must itself be understood historically. First, it must be established (which it isn’t clear to me has been done, whether by Marcuse or anyone else), and then it must be traced to its roots in the socio-historical conditions of the various periods in which it can be observed, whether this means finding some common condition, or set of conditions, that explain its persistence, or providing an explanation of how a set of relatively contingent circumstances led to its maintenance under different modes of production despite lacking such a common basis.<d-footnote>I will suggest a few possibilities on this score below, such as that it is existence of social presuppositions of the process of production that underlies a certain continuity in the determination of truth, and the monetization of these presuppositions that does the same with continuities in the determination of essence, but these are provisional hypotheses derived from the concrete historical material, and requiring confirmation from further historical investigation, rather than theoretical or methodological assumptions brought to that material on the basis of high-level generalization.</d-footnote> Not only that, but the question of what exactly is invariant in that concept, if anything is, must remain open throughout the investigation. Whether it is actually the determinations of unity, universality, abstraction, and truth that form the invariant content of the concept of essence, or even whether it is in terms of content that the concept is invariant, are questions whose answers, like those to the question of invariance itself, cannot be assumed from the start but must be found, tested, modified, and retested in the material itself as the process of investigation proceeds.</p> <p>Additionally, this obscurity about origins begins to give us a sense of why there is no historical account of the social conditions of Classical Athens in Marcuse’s essay, despite his claim that that is where the concept of essence first emerged. The ahistorical nature of the content allows it to appear as a pure origination, one that seems to have been completely contingent and in no need of explanation. Still, even the supposedly ahistorical nature of the content does not fully explain the complete lack of socio-historical grounding that we are discussing. For example, one would expect the position and function of the Platonic concept of essence to still be subject to such grounding given Marcuse’s framing, but this is conspicuously absent from his exposition.</p> <p>The reason for this has to do with the deeper set of deficiencies revealed by Marcuse’s framing, which themselves have to do with the overall interpretive apparatus of the essay, which is over-reliant on “expressive causality” or homology and ultimately subsumes its historical materialist elements under an idealist philosophy of history.<d-footnote>For an overview of the Althusserian critique of expressive causality and the subsumption of it under the critique of homology, see Fredric Jameson, _The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act,_ (Cornell University Press, 1981), 23--43. For the general conception of allegory and interpretive levels on which this analysis is based, see Jameson, _The Political Unconscious,_ 29--32.</d-footnote> This appeared in the framing in terms of the <em>expression</em> of real human struggles and desires “in the derived forms of the philosophical tradition,” but its centrality to Marcuse’s analysis is demonstrated much more clearly by taking the interpretive apparatus as a whole as our object of examination. In this schema, the text of the history of philosophy is read on multiple levels, each of which can be categorized according to the primary philosophical methodology that is operative in it.</p> <p>We can call the first level quasi-Heideggerian because it is where the lingering influence of a Heideggerian problematic—recall that Marcuse was a student of Heidegger—is most prominent. It is also the level on which the bulk of the interpretation of Plato’s concept of essence is conducted. At this level, Marcuse reads Plato’s concept of essence according to an altered version of the Heideggerean conception of metaphysics in which the primarily question is of the relationship between Being and beings, a relationship that is made possible by a transcendence of the “facticity” of beings.<d-footnote></d-footnote><d-footnote>See Martin Heidegger, "What is Metaphysics?," ed. Dieter Thomä, trans. Ian Moore and Gregory Fried, _Philosophy Today_ 62, no. 3 (2018): 733--51, &lt;https://doi.org/10.5840/philtoday20181024232&gt;, for the conception of metaphysics referenced in this paragraph, especially 739--44. This focus on transcendence also explains the transcendent character of the "common content," which encompasses the key determinations that attach to Being in opposition to beings, and so must be subject to the transcendence that produces this division.</d-footnote> For Marcuse, this transcendence does not take place on the basis of the “nihilation of the nothing,” but instead on the basis of the “critical consciousness of bad facticity, of unrealized potentialities.”<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33. For the "nihilation of the nothing," see Heidegger, "What is Metaphysics?," 740.</d-footnote> How the badness of facticity or the awareness of those unrealized potentialities is established for consciousness is not clarified, but presumably it has something to do with the seemingly inherent “quest for the ultimate unity, universality and truth of Being” and the “struggles and desires” that went into it, which formed a part of the framing discussed above. This ungrounded connection of Being to “authenticity” or potentiality, to “what should and can be,” provides the interpretive code on the basis of which the changing function of the concept of essence in the other historical examples is understood, and on which the connection to the next two levels is established.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33.</d-footnote></p> <p>We can call the second level the historical materialist level because it operates on the basis of the concept of the mode of production, although it does so according to an economically determined expressive causality that might incline us to label it “vulgar” historical materialism. This is the level at which the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence is read on the basis of changes to its position and function. It is this level of interpretation that generates the most interesting insights in the historical section of the essay, despite the limits of its expressive mechanism. In each case, changes in the function of the concept of essence are read first in terms of the division set up on the first level between bad facticity and potentiality, as embodying, distorting, displacing or eliminating the “critical gap” between them that was established in the the case of Plato, and then reread in terms of the homology between these changes and changes in the configuration of the forces and relations of production.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 34--7. For example, the positing of an absolute separation and externality between the two sides in the Medieval concept is understood as an expression of the relations of personal domination that characterized the feudal mode of production, and the subjectivization and displacement of the Cartesian concept of essence into the realm of logic and epistemology is understood as an expression of the individualization and (fetishized) subjection of those individuals to the conditions of production characteristic of the capitalist mode of production.</d-footnote> This order of operations also helps explain the lack of an account of the social determination of the Platonic concept of essence, which sets the baseline on which this second level of interpretation relies, and so falls outside of its purview.</p> <p>The third level can be labeled the quasi-Hegelian or idealist level because it operates on the basis of the concept of freedom, building on the readings of the previous two levels and rereading them in terms of freedom in order to construct a teleological metanarrative that resembles the Hegelian philosophy of history in its broad outlines. In this metanarrative, the “interest of freedom” is seen as the originating impulse and inner essence of the development of philosophy, and Marxism, or the “materialist doctrine of essence,” represents the culmination of that development insofar as it takes as its object the actualization of freedom—which has been made into a <em>real possibility</em> by the social conditions of the modern era.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 48--9, 56, and 60.</d-footnote> It is on this third level that the grounding of the connection between true Being and potentiality that was missing from the perspective of the first level takes place. We can now see that the “interest of freedom” is what establishes the badness of facticity and the conscious awareness of unrealized potentiality, and so makes possible the fundamental metaphysical division between Being and beings on which Marcuse’s interpretation of the concept of essence is based. It is able to do so because, as the origin and inner essence of the concept of essence, it is posited as implicitly containing the seeds of the whole development in-itself by the meta-narrative constructed through the interpretive apparatus. This determination by the interpretive apparatus further disincentivizes any investigation of the origins or socio-historical determination of the Platonic concept of essence because such investigation might disturb its function as a pure origin and inner essence of the development as a whole.</p> <p>It is the idealist philosophy of history constructed by the third level, and its subsumption of the historical materialist interpretation, based on the concept of the mode of production, under itself, that forms the most objectionable part of Marcuse’s overall position and causes the most distortion of both the historical material and the project of historical explanation itself. At the same time, even without that subsumption, Marcuse’s reliance on homology would have limited his ability to properly explain the socio-historical emergence and development of the concept of essence, even according to the determinations of the “materialist doctrine of essence” that he himself set out in the latter half of his essay.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 50--64.</d-footnote> In this latter section, he paints a more adequate picture of the principles of historical materialism, although they are still colored by their situation within the idealist and expressive interpretive frameworks of the overall exposition, and so they must be evaluated on a case by case basis as to their usefulness for our project.<d-footnote>See Appendix 1 for a discussion of some of the relevant principles.</d-footnote> Similarly the conclusions drawn must be called into question and reevaluated on the basis of concrete historical investigation.</p> <p>To avoid the problems that prevented Marcuse from developing an adequate account of the socio-historical determination of essence, our investigation must rest on a thoroughly different methodological foundation from his—one whose basic impulses arise from the determinate negation of the abstract transcendence, formalism and idealist philosophy of history that subsumed and restricted the historical materialist elements that gave Marcuse’s essay its original appeal. This means starting with the concrete socio-economic conditions themselves that gave rise to the concept of essence and any antecedents it may have had, rather than starting from presupposed conceptual determinations of that concept and interpreting them on the basis of a teleological metanarrative or philosophy of history.<d-footnote>My research has led me to locate this emergence not with Platonic theory of Forms, but with the substance monism of the early Pre-Socratic philosophers.</d-footnote> At the same time, it also means understanding those conditions in the context of a total social process centered around the mode(s) of production of concrete social formations and its transformation over time, and giving explanatory priority to the broadly economic elements that provide its foundation, while also respecting the relative autonomy of its various structural elements.<d-footnote>For a more detailed exposition of what I mean by the broadly economic and its foundational place in the overall mode of production, see Appendix 1.</d-footnote> Clearly, this remains an interpretive scheme. It could not be otherwise. But it is one that is not centered on the <em>expression</em> of the content of one level in the content of another level, or on the subordination of the whole interpretive apparatus under the determinative closure of a master code, but rather on the reciprocal determination of relatively autonomous elements. Finally, it involves an active and dynamic suspension of the presuppositions we all bring into historical interpretation in favor of a dialectical surrender to the object, but one which does not entail avoiding the responsibility of simultaneously <em>thinking</em> that object.<d-footnote>For more on this process of active surrender to the object, see Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, _Science of Logic,_ ed. and trans.

In his book <em>Manual and Intellectual Labor</em> Sohn-Rethel, like Marcuse, attempts to construct a grand historical narrative that explains the origins of a central feature of bourgeois thought—this time the epistemological foundations of “scientific cognition” as a whole and trace it back to its socio-historical foundations, which he locates in the “exchange abstraction” and, more generally, in the division between manual and intellectual labor. Also like Marcuse, Sohn-Rethel does this in order to say something about the overcoming of capitalism, this time in terms of the overcoming of said division between manual and intellectual labor, rather than in terms of the realization of freedom. In examining the work of Sohn Rethel, we will find that it is plagued by many of the same problems as Marcuse’s attempt. Our old friends formalism, homology, transcendence and idealism will all rear their heads once again, although in enough of a different manner as to remain instructive. If nothing else, this examination will serve to differentiate the methodological principles at work in this essay and the questions it attempts to answer from those of a superficially similar, but fundamentally different project that it might be associated with.</p> <p>The first point to make about <em>Manual and Intellectual Labor</em> is that despite its historical materialist dressing, Sohn-Rethel’s project is completely enveloped by the Kantian problematic it takes as its object of critique. He starts by saying that he accepts Kant’s premise that “the principles of knowledge fundamental to the quantifying sciences cannot be traced to the physical and sensorial capacity of experience.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor: A Critique of Epistemology_, trans. Martin Sohn-\ Rethel (Haymarket Books, 2021), 31.</d-footnote> But, like many before him, he is unsatisfied with the way Kant grounds this division between the <em>a priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em> in the transcendental unity of apperception, which is itself presented as an ungrounded source of “transcendental spontaneity.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor_, 31--2.</d-footnote> He argues that the fault in Kant’s project lies in his unwillingness to pursue his inquiry to the point of locating a “historical origin of our logical ability to construct mathematical hypotheses and the elements contributing to them.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 31--2. This reduction of all the content of the Kantian a priori to a mathematical basis most likely rests on a common faulty interpretation of the role of math in Kant's system (one typically derived from a reading of Kant's analytic presentation of the apriority of space as the form of outer intuition in the _Prolegomena_ which ignores the synthetic presentation of the apriority of space in the _Critique_). For a critique of this interpretation see Lisa Shabel, "Kant's 'Argument from Geometry,' " _Journal of the History of Philosophy_ 42, no. 2 (2004): 195--215, &lt;https://doi.org/10.1353/hph.2004.0034&gt;. This reduction is characteristic of Sohn-Rethel's presentation, which almost exclusively focuses on the quantitative and mathematical elements of philosophical and scientific cognition, which allows him to reduce thought, or "abstract intellect", to a form more easily assimilable to the abstract quantitative determinations of the "exchange abstraction."</d-footnote> His project in <em>Intellectual and Manual Labor</em> is to show that this historical origin lies in the “exchange abstraction” which becomes “converted into the conceptual structure of the abstract intellect.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor_, 57.</d-footnote> In conceiving his project this way, Sohn-Rethel retains the Kantian conception of scientific cognition—which is a product of determinate circumstances corresponding to a specific phase of the capitalist mode of production (and of the development of science)—and reifies it as the transcendental structure of “abstract intellect” and scientific thinking in general. Without going into the details of the many distortions of Marx’s analysis of the commodity form that result from this, I think it is sufficient here to say that this leads him into a formalism that is similar to Marcuse’s insofar as his appropriation of both Marx and the historical evidence are always already structured by this presupposition.<d-footnote>Some telling examples of this are Sohn-Rethel's dismissal of value as having "no thought content of its own, no definable logical substance" and "bearing no inherent reference to labor" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 40--1), his dismissal of the importance of the landed aristocracy and overemphasis on the role of circulation as the primary source of wealth in Archaic and Classical Greece, along with his characterization of this circulatory wealth as "merchants and users capital" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 83 &amp; 85), and his claim that the exchange abstraction is founded on "social postulates" and thus the concepts derived from it are normative and able to assume an independent logical existence separated from "statements of fact" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 56--7). In all of these cases, the evidence drawn upon is distorted in order to strengthen the isomorphism between commodity exchange (and the societies in which it took place) and the Kantian structure of cognition as divided between _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ (and the capitalist relations of production under which it was formulated).</d-footnote></p> <p>In addition to the formalism of his ahistorical conception of abstract intellect, Sohn-Rethel’s Kantian problematic also leads him to to formulate his conception of “the exchange abstraction” and its “laws” or “formal structure” on the basis of its necessary conditions of possibility. At first, he attempts to give his derivation of the structuring concepts of abstract intellect a materialist veneer by arguing that they derive from the <em>act</em> of exchange in its opposition to the <em>act</em> of use. But, as Jameson reminds us, historical materialism “does not assert the primacy of matter so much as it insists on an ultimate determination by the mode of production,” a reminder which equally applies to activity abstracted from its mode of production as it does matter.<d-footnote>Jameson, _The Political Unconscious_, 45</d-footnote> It also gradually becomes clear that it is not the act of exchange itself so much as the “social postulates” or “fictions” that underlie the “exchange abstraction (such as the postulate that “no physical change should occur in the commodities” during the act of exchange) that provide the actual basis on which the concepts are derived and “converted” into philosophical concepts. These postulates are conceived as having nothing to do with “statements of fact,” but rather, “are norms which commodity exchange has to obey to be possible.”<d-footnote>For the elements of the exchange abstraction as social postulates and conditions of the possibility of the act of exchange, as well as their fictional character, see Sohn-Rethel, *Intellectual and Manual Labo*r, 56--7 and 45, respectively. He does seem to recognize the incompatibility of this idealist procedure with his purported materialism in places, such as when he tries to reground the postulate of exemption from material change in human action by saying that "changes caused by human beings which infringe this postulate are outlawed by the police authority presiding in the market," but it is unclear who or what this "police authority" is or whether it corresponds to an actual and invariant condition of commodity exchange, and so falls flat.</d-footnote> It should be clear to anyone who has read the first chapter of <em>Capital</em> that this has nothing to do with the form-analysis undertaken by Marx there, in which it is the <em>relationship</em> established between two commodities in the act of exchange—in which one commodity is posited as the material embodiment of the value of the other commodity, which is itself thereby posited as having a value independent of its own material body and qualitative existence—that posits value as an abstract determination of the commodity, not any social postulates that function as transcendental conditions of the possibility of that act.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, _Capital: A Critique of Political Economy_, vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes (Penguin, 1990), 139--54.</d-footnote> Once again, we see that it is the relationship of reciprocal determination in which elements stand with respect to each other that forms the basis of historical materialist explanation, rather than reliance on a transcendent(al) content determined by a necessity that stems from the presuppositions of the theorist.</p> <p>Neither does “the physical act of transfer,” which Sohn-Rethel puts forward as the pseudo-materialist base upon which these social postulates are supposed to operate, play any part in Marx’s analysis of the commodity form.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 23.</d-footnote> It is this pseudo-materialist base that is critical in enabling the “conversion” of the concepts derived from the social postulates into concepts of philosophical or scientific cognition that take nature as their object. Sohn-Rethel argues that it is through the operation of these postulates in the “physical act of transfer”, that “the negation of the natural and material physicality [of the act itself] constitutes the positive reality of the abstract social physicality of the exchange process,” which thereby constitutes “a kind of abstract nature.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 47</d-footnote> It is this combination of the abstraction derived from the social postulates and the physicality of the act of exchange that allows the “conversion” into philosophical-scientific concepts to happen and establishes the validity of these concepts in their reference to nature.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 58</d-footnote></p> <p>It is here that we can finally begin to understand the otherwise strange and highly idiosyncratic decision to ground the account of real abstraction in the act of exchange considered as physical transfer and the social postulates considered as necessary conditions of possibility—a conception that one would be hard pressed to derive from the works of Marx taken on their own. It is the typically Kantian concern with establishing the validity of the non-empirical concepts involved in mathematical and scientific cognition in relation to experience that best makes sense of the motivation for this decision.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel indicates the importance of this concern for his investigation in the sections on "Reification at the Root of the Intellect\" and "Laws of Nature"; Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 60--2*.*</d-footnote> Without it, there would be no reason to “supplement” Marx in the way Sohn-Rethel does by dividing the process of abstraction involved in exchange into an <em>a priori</em> portion that involves conditions of possibility and <em>a posteriori</em> portion that imparts it with its own (abstract) physicality.</p> <p>In order to avoid the formalism and dualism that Sohn-Rethel is led into by his Kantian problematic, in this essay I will be focusing not on the emergence of some transcendental structure or general mode of thinking (whether this be conceived in terms of “scientific thought,” “abstract intellect,” “philosophy,” or “rationality”), but rather on the emergence of a determinate concept, abstract substance, as it arises in the determinate circumstances in which it was developed, and insofar as it represents the first clear formulation of the opposition between being and an abstract substratum thought to posit it and constitute its truth—without assuming that this recognizability entails a continuity in with later formulations of essence in terms of its meaning or function. This means to bracket off those other questions, not because I don’t think there is anything to them—I suspect that there are actually multiple relatively independent processes taking place on different time scales, but do not discount the possibility of a significant and transformative convergence of some of these processes in Archaic and Classical Greece that corresponds with the purported object of the above theories—but because I don’t think approaching such a question in such broad strokes is productive for understanding the actual historical developments under consideration. It is only by paying attention to the intricate and particular details of historical processes, and situating them within the context of the total social process that they form moments of, and of the determinate mode(s) of production on the basis of which that process takes place, that these questions can be answered without running the risk of falling into the schematic and ahistorical kind of thinking that overtook Sohn-Rethel. Unlike Sohn-Rethel, I do not think that there is a singular key to unlocking the mysteries of the social determination of abstract thought, and so, to sail through the narrow passage between the Scylla of this kind of reductionism and the Charybdis of losing oneself in the immensity of the details, broader questions must be sacrificed (at least temporarily) in order to preserve the seaworthiness of our explanatory vessel.<d-footnote>This also means bracketing for the moment the question of Greek mathematics and its relation to both earlier mathematical traditions and philosophy, although I do think there is something distinctive about greek math and it does have something to do with the same processes that led to the emergence of Greek philosophy, with which it seems to be intertwined (at least biographically in the lives of the early philosophers). In terms of changes in the form of thought, it seems to me that the most fruitful angle from which to tackle this topic would involve investigating the development of the judgment and the syllogism as conceptual-linguistic forms. I hope to build off of the present study by pursuing both of these lines of inquiry in future pieces.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="2-the-pre-history-of-the-concept-of-essence">2. The Pre-History of the Concept of Essence</h2> <h3 id="bardic-truth-and-its-mode-of-production-21">Bardic Truth and its Mode of Production (2.1)</h3> <p>As we saw above, in order to understand the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in Pre-Socratic Monism, we must situate it within the total social process that its development constituted a moment of.<d-footnote>For a more extensive discussion of what this means, see Appendix 1</d-footnote> This means looking back at its conceptual antecedents and the mode of production in which they were situated before moving on to the changes in that mode of production that conditioned the emergence of essence in the thought of the Pre-Socratics, which we will examine in section 2.2. In this section, I will content myself with a brief summary of the kind of society that existed in Greece at the earlier pole of this historical process, in order to then examine the mythico-poetic system of representation that corresponded to it. It was in this social and representational context that one of the primary determinations of essence identified by Marcuse, truth (<em>alētheia</em>), had been situated before changes in the mode of production led to its re-configuration into the form it would take in the concept of essence developed by the Pre-Socratic Monists.</p> <p>In the Homeric poems, we can see both poles of this process of development—despite the archaizing perspective of the bardic author. For now, our focus must be on the earlier pole, which was characterized by a mode of production in which commodity production and exchange were relatively marginal and slavery had not yet taken on the central place in the mode of exploitation that it would in the later period.<d-footnote>See Appendix 2, 260-266 for a more extensive discussion of the role of slavery in the two periods and a critique of Finley's conflation of them in _The World of Odysseus._</d-footnote> In the communities of this period, the class structure of society was instead centered on external appropriation of the surplus of other communities through warfare and raiding and the internal appropriation of surplus in the form of tribute on the basis of the role that warrior-aristocrats played in the necessary communal labors of religion and self-defense.<d-footnote>See Appendix 2, 253-260 for a more in depth look at the different elements of the mode of exploitation in these communities.</d-footnote> The most important point here is that within the community the mode of surplus appropriation was still, to some extent, based on the social role of the warrior aristocracy in the necessary surplus labor on which the survival of the community as a whole—and the independent production of the individual households that together constituted that community—depended. This is true not only of the martial activities that directly ensured the survival of the community, but also of the religious activities that cohered the community <em>as a community</em> and mediated the reproduction of the social relations of production through which the direct production of the means of life was carried out. In this sense, the warrior-aristocracy provided the unity of the community as such, and they did so on the basis of personal authority and a network of ritually institutionalized relationships, which guaranteed the sanctity of that authority through the supersensible power of the gods.<d-footnote>A possible explanation of why the authority that guaranteed the sanctity of the customs and rituals through which social relations were mediated took the form of supersensible or divine power is suggested by Marx in the section of the _Grundrisse_ on pre-capitalist social forms, where he says that in early communal forms of society, both the social and objective presuppositions of direct appropriation though the labor process "are not themselves the _product_ of labor, but appear as its natural or _divine_ presuppositions." Karl Marx, _Grundrisse: Foundations of the Critique of Political Economy (Rough Draft),_ trans. Martin Nicolaus (Penguin, 1993), 472. With this in mind, we can understand the need for divine authority to guarantee personal authority and the institutionalized relationships it was embedded in as a result of the fact that the social conditions of both (such as custom, kinship structures, common language etc) are _presuppositions_ that do not stem from the activity of the individuals that make up the living community themselves.</d-footnote></p> <p>The bard was another figure involved in this system of divine sanction, and it is in the religious structure of Homeric society that connects the bard and the warrior aristocrat—and in its mytho-poetic representation—that we can most clearly see the place of truth in Pre-Archaic Greek social formations, in which it had a different content and set of conceptual relations than it would come to have in PSM. The bard was seen as able to imbue action and speech with divine sanction, though of a particular type: the sanction of the Muses.<d-footnote>Marcel Detienne, _The Masters of Truth in Archaic Greece,_ trans. Janet Lloyd (Zone Books, 1999), 39--42.</d-footnote> The Muses were the divine personification of <em>mousa</em>, sung speech, which was connected with “laudatory speech”.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 40.</d-footnote> They were also portrayed as the daughters of Memory (<em>Mnēmosynē</em>) and, with their power to know “all things that were, things to come and things past,” they “claim[ed] the privilege of ‘speaking the truth.’ ”<d-footnote>Homer, _Iliad_, trans. Richmond Lattimore (University of Michigan Press, 1951), 1.70, quoted in Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 42--3; Hesiod, _Theogony_, trans. Richmond Lattimore (University of Michigan Press, 1951), 28, 32, and 38, quoted in Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 42--5.</d-footnote> Detienne argues that this sung speech allowed the bard to “enter into contact with the other world, and his memory granted him the power to ‘decipher the invisible.’ ”<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 43.</d-footnote> It is this contact with the invisible world, facilitated by divine, oracular memory, that allowed the bard, like the Muses, to speak truth, to confer divine sanction on his words of praise and blame, and the deeds they referred to, most importantly the deeds of the heroic warrior-aristocrat.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 45.</d-footnote> It is through the bard that the <em>kleos</em> (glory) of the warrior was thought to reach not just the ears of the community and future generations, but up to the heavens.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 46.</d-footnote> In this way the bard played a role in solidifying the divine sanction that ensures the social sanctity of the institutions centered around the warrior-aristocracy.</p> <p>Should we understand this social function of the bard, in which the truth of their statements was embedded, as merely an ideological support for the rule of the warrior-aristocrat? This was clearly one aspect of the bard’s function, but even it must be taken in the context of a social situation in which that rule was based on the role of the aristocrat in the necessary social labor that ensured the reproduction of the community. Furthermore, the bards themselves clearly played an independent role in that necessary labor insofar as their praise and blame, as well as the broader narrative context in which it was allocated, did not merely sanction the rule of warrior-aristocracy, but also preserved and transmitted the customs and broader cultural heritage through which social relations, both within a community and between communities in a broader network of alliance and obligation, were mediated. This is the function that secured their truth, that gave it its meaning, that vested it in them as bearers of that function, and that was expressed as an oracular connection with a divine world in which memory provides access equally to past, present, and future as elements of an atemporal ‘plane of truth.’</p> <p>At this point, it is useful to compare this mythico-religious conception of truth with the determination of truth as it would appear once it had become situated within the conceptual relations of PSM. In the latter, truth will have taken on the determination that Marcuse identifies with it of establishing a hierarchical relation between levels of reality in which one level is taken to be in some sense more “real” than another. It will also have assumed the connection to unity, universality, and abstraction that Marcuse posits as characteristic of the concept of essence. In the earlier bardic conception, despite significant continuities (which we will return to shortly) the overall determination of truth is different on both scores. On the first, while it is does appear to distinguish between two different levels of reality, and does do so to some extent—i.e. between the divine, atemporal “plane of truth” and the mortal realm—its real opposition is with oblivion (lēthē), and its function is primarily to distinguish, within the mortal realm, and through the action of divine memory, that which is to be preserved and elevated up to the undying realm of the gods from that which does not merit preservation and so will be forgotten and sink down into oblivion.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 47--52*.*</d-footnote> This is a different sorting process from the one involved in the truth of PSM, one that operates on the basis of moral categories (praiseworthiness, blameworthiness, glory, etc.) rather than the logical or metaphysical categories of the latter conception (unity, universality, abstraction). Even the “unseen world” that the truth of the bards provides access to is not seen so much as underlying the mortal world as being parallel to and in constant interaction with it.</p> <p>Still, the similarities are significant. Most importantly, bardic truth does posit a division between different planes of reality, one sensible and mortal, and the other supersensible and in some way atemporal. This atemporality has a certain ambivalence between the senses of <em>immortality</em> as that which does not die and <em>permanence</em> as that which is invariant or eternal. Both of these senses can be seen as related to the social function of the bard. The first relates to the distinctly personal and subjective aspects of this function. It is the mechanism of oral transmission and its characteristic objects (warrior-aristocrats and their words and deeds) that determine atemporality as immortality, as an elevation of particular elements of the concrete mortal world to a special status in which their temporal nature is not so much removed as infinitely extended by the memory of the bard and the act of preservation and transmission through the process of telling and retelling.<d-footnote>As a bad infinity, this process of telling and retelling cannot realize the immortality that it ascribes to its objects. Instead it must inscribe them within the perpetual ought of its own process of reproduction, the instability of which, along with its dependence on continuous reinscription within the living community, probably contributes to the porosity of the boundary between the "unseen world" and the mortal realm, although this is clearly also a product of the need to posit more active divine intervention to ensure the sanctity of ritually inscribed relations whose purely interpersonal basis would leave them relatively insecure.</d-footnote> The second sense is more properly atemporal, in that it indicates an exteriority to the flow of time, rather than merely being infinitely extended out into that flow. This is the sense that attaches to the plane of truth itself, in which past, present and future are seen as simultaneously accessible, and, in a sense, undifferentiated, or at least cut off from their temporal ordering. It is not the personal-subjective aspects of the bards function that underlie this second sense of atemporality—and so also the basic separation between the planes that lies at the heart of the determination of truth—but the social aspect, or the way in which the bard relates to the reproduction of the social totality, that does so.</p> <p>In preserving and transmitting the customs and broader cultural heritage in which the social relations of production and reproduction were embedded, the bard reproduces the necessary social <em>presuppositions</em> of the social formation. As presuppositions, these stand outside the sensuous activity of the community as conditions of communal production that are not themselves produced by the community. They thus stand outside the normal process of becoming that characterizes the everyday life of the community, and bring together past (as pre-existent), present (as conditions of the current existence of the living community) and future (as conditions of the continuing reproduction of the community) in their separation from that process. This can be seen as the foundation of the second sense of atemporality as being outside the flow of time, as well as of the basic separation between a sensuous and temporal plane of reality and a supersensuous and atemporal one on which the bardic conception of truth as a whole rests.</p> <p>Despite the otherwise general reconfiguration of the concept of truth in the time between the bardic conception and that of PSM, in which the interactive parallelism of the earlier conception became a foundational relationship based on logical-metaphysical rather than moral categories, the basic division on the basis of which the latter conception continued to be structured, between a sensible and temporal realm and a supersensible and atemporal one, can be seen to have already been present in the earlier conception. How should we explain this continuity? Given the basis of the earlier form of the division in the social function of the bard of reproducing the necessary presuppositions of the social formation as a whole, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the persistence of this division was based on the persistence of this social function and to posit that the changes in its organization have their basis in changes in the operation of that function. If we then look at the historical evidence, we do in fact find that this function both persists and undergoes significant change. As we shall see in more detail below, in the later period the impersonal institution of monetary exchange had come to replace the relational institutions of the earlier period as the primary form of social mediation on which the unity of the social formation as such was based, and so also it had itself become the primary social presupposition on which social production rested.<d-footnote>This is not to say that custom or religion stopped playing this function entirely---their continued existence attests to their continued functionality---but simply that they no longer occupied the primary position which they had in the earlier relations of production.</d-footnote> With this transformation, the bard, as a personal, subjective bearer of the function of reproducing this presupposition, was replaced by money itself as an objective bearer of that same function. Simultaneously, truth became detached from its connection to the social function of an individual with whose speech it was coextensive and began to take on the determinations of the money form, with its division between a concrete material embodiment and an abstract value underlying it, and its role as universal equivalent that provides unity to the diverse commodities related to it in terms of their value.</p> <p>As we shall see in the following sections, the emergence of essence in PSM and its relation to the money form is more complicated than this correspondence would suggest. For one, the objectification of the primary social presuppositions of the changing mode of production meant the dissolution of the direct relationship between speech and the social function of reproducing those presuppositions. It is this direct relationship that grounds the truth of bardic speech, and without it, any assertion of the continuing relevance of that social function to the determination of truth runs the risk of being reduced to mere homology. Relatedly, the correspondence on its own is unsatisfactory insofar as it does not explain why the objectification of the social preconditions of the process of production resulted in a transformation of the determination of truth rather than its abandonment as the social system in which it was embedded collapsed. In fact, there is a divergent intellectual tendency among the Greek aristocracy that did abandon the concept of truth after the collapse of the social conditions of its mytho-religious formulation—the intellectual lineage leading from Simonides of Ceos down to the sophists and beyond.<d-footnote>For the relation between Simonedes and the Sophists, see Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 107--19.</d-footnote> At the same time, the early philosophers, in whose thought the concept of essence emerged, did maintain a degree of continuity with the older conception of truth, and it was precisely on the grounds of the correspondence under discussion here that they did so. This continuity of the correspondence is indicative, and can direct us in the right direction, but it cannot be taken as an explanation on its own. The questions now are why the early philosophers maintained this continuity, and in what ways (and to what extent) were the continuities and differences in their conception of truth determined by the objectification discussed here. To answer these questions, we must turn to the historical context in which both this objectification and the emergence of the concept of essence took place.</p> <h3 id="the-crisis-of-aristocracy-22">The Crisis of Aristocracy (2.2)</h3> <p>Filling out the tapestry whose warp has been laid out above means turning to the transformations wrought by commercialization, military reform and the consolidation of a slave mode of production in the development of Greek social formations between the Early Iron Age and the Archaic Period.<d-footnote>The periodization scheme I am using here is based on the one in Alex Knodell, _Societies in Transition in Early Greece: An Archeological History_ (University of California Press, 2021), 7.</d-footnote> The reciprocal dynamic between commercialization and the changing mode of exploitation played out over a number of centuries, and culminated in 1) the crystallization of the money form out of the process of exchange and 2) consolidation of the mode of exploitation around private appropriation by a landowning aristocracy of the surplus produced by unfree labor.<d-footnote>For the concept of unfree labor in Ancient Greece, see G.E.M. De Ste. Croix, _The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World: from the Archaic Age to the Arab Conquests_ (Cornell University Press, 1981), 133--74.</d-footnote> This process of development is explored in further detail in Appendix 2. For now, suffice it to say that around the 7th century BCE, these processes had reached a critical point in which their effects, especially those of monetization, began to ripple out into society broadly and at an increasing pace, which was then further accelerated by the invention of coinage.<d-footnote>On this last point, see Richard Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy_ (Cambridge University Press, 2004).</d-footnote> It is these effects which characterize to a large extent the profound crises and transformations of the Archaic period, including the development of Pre-Socratic monism.</p> <p>Even the most noted change of this period, the development of the <em>polis</em>, can be seen to be a result of this process of commoditization and monetization. In Appendix 2, I describe how the centers of concentrated settlement that would develop into the first <em>poleis</em> were themselves nodes of long distance trade and the expanding commodity relations that accompany it, as well as the role of this commercial expansion in the centering of slavery within the primary process of production. The <em>polis</em>, as an urban area that incorporated its surrounding countryside, on which it was dependent for subsistence, was made possible by these same developments.</p> <p>That the typical <em>polis</em> was centered around its <em>agora</em>, or marketplace, is indicative, but even more decisive is the composition of the <em>poleis,</em> or more specifically, of the <em>astē.</em> Their primary residents were 1) aristocrats enabled to live away from their land holdings by the surplus labor extracted from slaves, serfs, or debt bondsman 2) craftsmen whose livelihoods were primarily dependent on selling commodities to those aristocrats in exchange for the products of that same surplus labor, and 3) the urban poor who begged or sold their labor-power to the aristocrats or to the <em>polis</em> itself for a wage.<d-footnote>See De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 114--33, 208--26, 269--78; Moses Finley, _The Ancient Economy,_ Updated Edition (University of California Press, 1999), 123--49. It is the combination of De Ste. Croix's characterization of these groups and emphasis on the importance of unfree labor in the mode of exploitation with Finley's emphasis on the consumptive nature of ancient cities and the importance of the landed aristocracy in that consumption that best allows us to see this point.</d-footnote> In a <em>polis</em> like Athens, even the funding of public institutions was derived in large part from the dedications, <em>eisphorai</em> and <em>liturgoi</em> of the aristocrats, in other words from the proceeds of selling the products of the surplus labor appropriated on their estates as commodities (and, even in the earliest cases of temple dedications, these products were exchanged for (often mass produced) objects made of metal).<d-footnote>For the _eisphorai_ and _liturgoi_, see Michael Gagarin, _Democratic Law in Classical Athens_ (University of Texas Press, 2020), Chapter 1, Kindle. For the mass production of temple dedications, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 102--9.</d-footnote> In this sense, the <em>polis</em> as a whole was a social form mediated by monetized impersonal relations. The city itself, the <em>astu</em>, which formed the center of the <em>polis</em> and gave it its unity, was determined as a site of commodity production, exchange, and consumption above all else. Its development was to a large extent a result of the increasing interdependence brought on by the increasing division of labor that arose and expanded along with the expansion of commodity production and exchange, but it was equally made possible by the changes in the mode of exploitation that accompanied this commercialization, which centered the private exploitation of unfree labor on the estates of aristocratic landowners as the primary mode of surplus appropriation on which the subsistence of the aristocracy—and the existence of the broader social formation as such—was based.</p> <p>In contrast to the personal authority that gave unity to the earlier social formations discussed above, and the institutions of personal reciprocity that mediated social relations within and between them, the monetized exchange relations that formed the primary basis of social mediation within the polis were impersonal and given objective unity by money itself as the universal embodiment of commodity-producing human labor. As the universal equivalent, money is separated off from the diverse mass of commodities as the material body in which each and all of them represent their value. It homogenizes the diverse particular forms of human activity whose products it is exchanged for. When a commodity producer exchanges their product for money, they exchange it for the embodiment of human labor in the abstract, for a commodity that has the exclusive function of representing the value of all other commodities. In this act of exchange, they posit their concrete, particular, private labor as abstract, universal, social labor. To the extent that a member of society produces commodities that they exchange for money, they posit their labor as social and qualitatively equal with all the other particular forms of labor that express their values in money. They posit their own labor as a fraction of the total social labor, but at the same time as social only insofar as it is exchanged for money, that is to say only indirectly. In this way the money form privatizes at the same time as it socializes, obscuring the social character of the productive activity of the members of society by embodying it as an external object, and one which can be possessed by an individual.</p> <p>This means that social mediation lost its interpersonal basis to the extent that it became monetized. If a man had money, he didn’t need a patronymic and lineage, nor loyalty, nor customary obligation, nor reputation, nor martial prowess to exercise social power or accumulate its trappings; he could pay for whatever product of the labor of others he wanted or needed and they wouldn’t ask who he was or why he wanted it, so long as they received money in return. To command an army no longer required one to inhabit a defined place in a hierarchy of privileges and obligations defined by honor and heredity but merely to have enough money to pay mercenaries to do your bidding, and this is how many Tyrants usurped power in the Archaic period and beyond.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 279--83*.*</d-footnote> As I noted at the end of the last section, it also meant that the formerly customary and interpersonal social presuppositions of the production and reproduction of the community became increasingly objectified in money itself, which gave unity to the now increasingly indirect and increasingly complex sociality of the different labors involved in the production and reproduction of the social formation as such.</p> <p>These developments resulted in a series of acute social crises that spread out across the Greek Mediterranean as the traditional social forms that undergirded the personal authority and class cohesion of the warrior-aristocracy were undermined. These crises began as crises of the warrior-aristocracy in the face of changing social conditions that then turned into general social crises—to a large extent as a result of the aristocratic responses to those very conditions. We already see this state of crisis expressed in the Homeric epics, both of which revolve around crises of aristocratic reciprocity and the institutions that mediated it.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 44.</d-footnote> It is these institutions themselves and the aristocratic ideals associated with them that explicitly frame the crises that animate the poems. The greed of Agamemnon and the Suitors can be seen as results of the new incentives for accumulation that accompany commercialization and that now outweighed the traditional imperatives for the leader to make a fair distribution or the guests to respect the hospitality of their host. Inversely, the refusal of Achilles to accept anything in exchange for his honor shows the unsuitability of the heroic ideal to the developing forms of social mediation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 38.</d-footnote> Finally, although there are other examples that could be given, the need for divine intervention to prevent the spiraling out of retribution and blood feud as a result of Odysseus’ decidedly heroic and honorable killing of the suitors shows the unsustainability of such forms of retribution in an increasingly (commercially) integrated society that had increasingly little place for the interpersonal violence that surrounded the warrior-aristocrat and which in many ways constituted his distinguishing feature.<d-footnote>This divine intervention is also indicative insofar as it is the gods, those supreme guarantors of aristocratic rule and superiority, who the poet ultimately relies on to resolve the seemingly insoluble contradictions arising from the system of honor and retribution in the mortal world.</d-footnote></p> <p>The Homeric response to the crisis laid out in the poems is characteristic of the overall aristocratic response to crisis in its tendency to lionize the outmoded institutions and values that previously upheld and legitimized aristocratic rule while ignoring or degrading the elements of change that undercut its viability. In a sense the aristocracy as a class acted in similar fashion to Achilles or Odysseus, obstinately trying to hold on to their honor, to the system of values and institutions in which their power and their way of life were embedded, in the face of a reality that ensured that this attempt would lead them to ruin. This impulse to double down on the traditional ideals and modes of conduct in the face of changing circumstances is part of what spelled trouble for the hereditary aristocracy in the context of a social world in which the development of commodity relations had created more integrated social formations with new incentives for accumulation of individual wealth, and possibly had also reduced the tolerance of the lower classes, especially the upper strata of these lower classes, for being treated as targets of appropriation rather than partners to an equal exchange.<d-footnote>Cf. Marx, _Capital, vol. I,_ 178*.* Aristotle also gives an example of this dynamic in the _Politics,_ when he describes the way the ruling family of the hereditary aristocracy of Mytilene, the Penthilidae, used to go around beating people over the head with clubs, until they were attacked in turn by a certain Megacles who took offense to this behavior. Aristotle, _Politics,_ in _The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation_, vol. 2, ed. Jonathan Barnes (Princeton University Press, 2014), 2082.</d-footnote></p> <p>The fuller extent of this dynamic comes into view when we look at what we know of the early laws of Athens and the circumstances that gave birth to them. The homicide law of Drako is clearly a response to the untenability of inter-elite blood feuds and the general impression we have of the seventh century BCE is that it was riven by crises arising from this kind of violent inter-elite strife within the hereditary aristocracy and between them and newer claimants to wealth and power.<d-footnote>See, e.g., Federica Carugati, "Athens Before the Crisis," in _Creating a Constitution: Law, Democracy and Growth in Ancient Athens_ (Princeton University Press, 2019), 23--4. Solon too can be seen to be concerned not so much with supporting the lower classes as with curbing those aristocratic practices which threatened the stability of the community as such, as argued by Harris in Edward M. Harris, "A Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" in _The Development of the Polis in Archaic Greece_, ed. Lynette G. Mitchell and P.J. Rhodes (Routledge, 1997), 111.</d-footnote> It is also clear from the laws of Solon and his description of the crisis that prompted his intervention that this kind of inter-elite conflict had broadened out into a general breakdown of social order in which the type of raiding we saw as a key part of the surplus appropriation of the old warrior-aristocracy became common <em>within</em> the <em>polis,</em> leading to the enslavement of citizens and accelerating the impoverishment of the small peasants and their growing indebtedness.<d-footnote>Harris, "A New Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" 106.</d-footnote> We should see this internal breakout of violent appropriation of land, people and goods as the one of the final obstinate spasms of the declining warrior-aristocracy in the face of their changing circumstances. Indeed, the Solonian legislation was the first in a series of upheavals and constitutional changes that registered and expanded the power of the <em>demos</em>, the lower classes, and laid the foundations for democracy.</p> <p>At the same time, this violent spasm was not just the death rattle of an old form of aristocracy, it was also the final labor pang in the birth of a new form. One of its most significant functions was to allow the consolidation of land in the hands of the aristocrats through direct violence, debt and the exercise of political power, thereby establishing the basis of their continuing supremacy within the emerging relations of exploitation.</p> <p>Solon’s laws also abolished the <em>hektemoroi</em>, the situation in which a portion of the population had to pay one-sixth part of their product to others. Harris argues that this did not represent the abolition of debt or the ending of a type of serfdom, as has been traditionally argued, but rather the prohibition of tribute payments like those seen in the Homeric epics, but which had become formalized into a system of fixed payments.<d-footnote>Harris, "A New Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" 103--11</d-footnote> If this is correct, then it would represent an even more explicit sweeping away of the last vestiges of the traditional mode of exploitation of the warrior-aristocracy. Whether this represents the abolition of debt, the ending of a serf-like system or the abolition of tribute payments, it—coupled with the concentration of landed property in aristocratic hands, the increased legal protections and expansion of the scope of the courts, and the ban on enslavement of Athenian citizens—would have cleared the way for the consolidation of the mode of production around the commercialized polis—where dispossessed peasants would have had to have gone and become artisans, beggars or hired laborers (outcomes encouraged by other elements of the laws attributed to Solon, such as banning the export of grain and requiring fathers to teach their sons a trade)—on the basis of the aristocratic exploitation of slave labor on large landed estates in the countryside.<d-footnote>On the other Solonian Laws, see Carugati, "Athens Before the Crisis," 24.</d-footnote></p> <p>It is also worth noting in connection with this that Solon made wealth—defined by agricultural output—the primary criteria for political participation, which likely expanded the base of that participation to certain upper-middle strata who had previously been excluded, even if the distinctions between the ‘classes’ were fairly fine and all referred to owners of substantial amounts of property, as Osborne argues.<d-footnote>Robin Osborne, _Greece in the Making: 1200--497 BC,_ 2nd ed. (Routledge, 2009), 208.</d-footnote> With these changes—already developing before the Solonian reforms and continuing to be given further definition after, but for which the Solonian crisis and its purported solution represented a decisive shift—we see how the death throes of the old warrior-aristocracy, and the aristocratic reaction against them, led to their transformation into an aristocracy defined by ownership of the primary means of production (land) and the exploitation of slave labor.</p> <p>Across the Greek Mediterranean, the primary agents in the overthrow of the old aristocratic political order were a series of figures known as tyrants (among whom some count Solon himself, although he was somewhat unusual in being appointed to resolve the civil strife in Athens rather than seizing power by force). The tyrants were not just agents but also expressions of the crisis of aristocracy—and of the class struggle that it was enmeshed with. They often rose to power using the new means made available to them by the process of commercialization and the conflict generated by the exhaustion of traditional modes of aristocratic power. They played aristocratic factions and clans off each other, took up the causes of the burgeoning middle strata of medium sized landowners and larger landowners excluded from the hereditary aristocracy’s monopoly on political power (some of whom probably derived their wealth from commercial activities before using it to buy land), played on the discontent among the lower strata of small and dispossessed peasants, hired mercenaries to back their coups, and bought off important people and segments of the population either directly or through public expenditure. Many of these means were based directly on money as a new impersonal form of social power that could be accumulated by an individual and used to purchase things (status, good will, military forces) traditionally reserved for those who had personal authority issuing from their place in a system of defined social roles and obligations. Others were based on the conditions of class struggle associated with large-scale shifts in social relations produced by both commercialization and the consolidation of a slave mode of production. It was these conditions that were decisive for the tyrants writ large and that defined their overall historical role in breaking the political control of the hereditary warrior-aristocracy and expanding the class base of political participation.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 279--83.</d-footnote></p> <p>Along with commercialization, changes in the mode of exploitation, and the class struggle that accompanied these, the final major factor that drove the crisis of aristocracy in the Archaic was a shift in the organization and conduct of warfare known as the Hoplite Revolution. Though the orthodox position that a revolution in the conduct of warfare—in which the adoption of the hoplite panoply and phalanx tactics led to the increasing importance of a middling stratum of independent farmers in the composition of Greek armies starting in the 7th century BCE, and, as a result, to the increasing political and social power of this middling stratum—remains controversial, and continues to be challenged in many of its details, Hanson persuasively argues that it holds up in its broad strokes.<d-footnote>Victor Davis Kagan, "The Hoplite Narrative," in _Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece,_ ed. Donald Kagan and Gregory F. Viggiano (Princeton University Press, 2013), 256--70.</d-footnote> This “revolution” would have displaced the traditional warrior-aristocracy from its central position in the necessary communal labor of warfare, thereby further undermining the traditional base of their position within the class structure of their social formations and so of the legitimacy of their rule. Combined with the other factors discussed above, this represented a complete break with the former social relations that had upheld the warrior-aristocracy as a class and erosion of the basis for their own self-conception. It created a crisis in which the very definition of aristocracy was called into question at the same time as the aristocrats found themselves increasingly embattled with challenges to their position from below. In a certain sense, the erosion of the religious and military basis of their previous mode of exploitation left them with little justification for their rule and position in society aside from bare exploitation itself, which would’ve provided little ideological support in the face of challenges from the tyrants and demands for increasing rights and privileges from the rising middle strata and the lower classes that often formed the broader social base of their struggles. Add to this the fact that attempts to cling to the old ways were actively creating dysfunction and only increasing the strife, and it is clear that an ideological shift needed to take place, both in terms of legitimation and practical orientation, in order for the aristocracy to re-consolidate itself and its place in the fledgling relations of production that were arising around it.</p> <p>It is in the context of this need that we should understand the development and spread of Pre-Socratic Monism and the concept of essence which emerged within it. But, before turning to PSM itself, it is useful to look at the writings of Theognis of Megara, in which we can see evidence of the shifting aristocratic response to this crisis and the changes it brought to the determination of truth even before development of PSM.</p> <h3 id="theognis-a-transitional-conception-of-truth-23">Theognis: A Transitional Conception of Truth (2.3)</h3> <p>The poems attributed to Theognis are thought to have been written sometime between 650 and 550 BCE, thus firmly within the early period of the acute crisis of aristocracy that I have been discussing, but slightly before (or contemporaneous with) the first thinkers of PSM. In them, the poet bemoans the state of affairs in his polis, where, “this city is a city still, but lo! her people are other men, who of old knew neither judgments nor laws, but wore goatskins to pieces about their sides, and had their pasture like deer without this city; and now they be good men, O son of Polypaus, and they that were high be now of low estate.”<d-footnote>Theognis, "The Elegiac Poems of Theognis," in _Elegy and Iambus,_ vol. 1, Perseus Digital Library, 53--60.</d-footnote> These new men from the countryside, who the poet feels has usurped the place of his aristocratic peers, are distinguished throughout the poems by their attaining their position as a result of wealth (<em>ploutos)</em> rather than by being of good stock. The other oppositions that structure the poems are between truth—both as honesty and reality—and deception (or falsity), and between the good and the bad. These oppositions are structured in such a way that truth is aligned with good stock (heredity) and falsity/deception with wealth, while the good and the bad stand in an ambiguous and reversible position with respect to the others as a result of the falsity and deception generated by wealth. It is anxiety over the difficulty involved in distinguishing the <em>truly</em> good, which is aligned with heredity, but under the corrupting influence of wealth requires supplemental qualities to distinguish it—qualities like intelligence/judgment (<em>gnōmē</em>), power (<em>dynamis</em>, which still has its bodily/martial strength connotations, but has taken on a sense of authority/influence that is probably more operative here<em>)</em>, and moderation or self control—from the mere appearance of goodness created by wealth.<d-footnote>Moderation or self-control are most directly expressed in terms of taking the _messēn hodon_, the middle road or being _mesos_, in the middle.</d-footnote> At the same time, despite the identification of wealth with corruption, this process of discernment is explicitly aligned with the discernment of legitimate currency from counterfeit, which is used as a model for the difference between outward appearance (<em>ideai)</em> and a true, inner content (such as a person’s mind or heart).<d-footnote>Theognis, "The Elegiac Poems of Theognis," 119--28.</d-footnote></p> <p>The first thing to note here is that unlike in the Homeric picture of the crisis that we discussed above, the commercial origins of the more acute crisis faced by Theognis can no longer be omitted or downplayed. At the same time, the effects of commercialization—represented here by wealth (the abstract expression of which is almost certainly a sign of its monetization)—can still be, and constantly are, denigrated and disavowed. This shows a certain continuity in the aristocratic response to commercialization and its effects—despite the shift in emphasis from omission and downplaying to denigration and disavowal, and despite the explicit foregrounding of (the bearers of) monetized wealth as the cause of the crisis.</p> <p>The second is that heredity has become the defining feature of aristocracy rather than honor or martial prowess, despite the supplemental quality power (authority/influence) preserving some residue of the origins of the former in the latter. On the other hand, the other two supplemental qualities represent newer values that were absent in the Homeric portrayal of the warrior-aristocrat (although we might see a precursor to the foregrounding of judgment in the craftiness of Odysseus), ones determined by the crisis and changing material basis of aristocracy itself. It is telling in this respect that one of the primary meanings of judgment within the poems seems to be the ability to correctly discern who and what is truly good in the face of the deceptive appearances generated by wealth, which is to say that judgment, as a definitional attribute of true aristocracy entails to a large extent the very ability to distinguish the aristocratic from the common. In this sense we could say that in Theognis, the aristocratic value system that upheld the legitimacy of the Homeric warrior-aristocrat has been evacuated of much of its concrete meaning and reduced to a bare status distinction the primary determination of which—heredity—is not substantial enough to clearly delineate it in the eyes of even its defenders.</p> <p>The third thing of note is that the conception of truth put forward here represents a sort of intermediate conception between the mytho-religious and philosophical conceptions discussed above in relation to bardic truth. In Theognis, truth had not yet taken on its relationship to the metaphysical categories of unity, universality, and abstraction that it would in the concept of essence. Its sorting process still operated on the basis of moral criteria (albeit new moral criteria) and took people, words, and deeds as its characteristic objects. It was concerned with separating the good (aristocratic) person—or their actions, words or intentions—from the bad, though this had already become a process that functioned on the basis of a split between hierarchically ordered levels of reality, between sensible outward appearances and an imperceptible true content seen to underlies them.<d-footnote>The modeling of this separation on the difference between either the exchange value of a commodity and its use-value, or between the material body of gold and silver and their value---which underlie the ability to counterfeit, or to find that the money you exchanged for was not actually equal to the value of the commodities exchanged for it---is already suggestive of the influence of money on this reconfiguration.</d-footnote> It also still maintained a connection between truth and the social position of its bearer, although the privileged position had shifted from that of the bard to that of the aristocrat himself. On the whole, it is a conception of truth that appears relatively confused and empty of content. The possibility of accessing the truth underlying an appearance seems uncertain, as do the criteria on which the distinction between the true and the deceptive should be based. Even the criteria that are put forward are either themselves unstable and insufficient, like heredity, or relatively empty and circular, like judgment. In this sense, Theognis’ conception of truth gives voice to a problem that it does not have the conceptual resources to address, or even formulate clearly.</p> <p>At the end of Part 1, I argued that the transition from the bardic conception of truth to that of PSM was a result of the objectification of the function of reproducing the primary social presuppositions that underlie the existence of the social formation as a whole. Theognis lived in a social formation in which this objectification was relatively incomplete and it is on that basis that we can understand the incompleteness of his conception of truth. This incomplete objectification had proceed to the point where the individual-subjective aspects of the social function of the bard had been supplanted, but the generalization of monetary mediation had not yet reached the point that it would after the introduction of coinage, and so the position of money as the primary presupposition of the social totality had not been fully solidified.<d-footnote>For a similar, though ultimately divergent, account of this objectification and the role of coinage in it using different terminology, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote></p> <p>It is also in this light that we should see the inaccessibility of truth in Theognis, as well as the relative diminishment of the importance of atemporality in his conception of it. It is because the social function of the bard had broken down and the reproduction of the social presuppositions had not yet found a stable bearer in money that the status of the truth, which had previously been grounded in that function, became uncertain<d-footnote>Clearly it is not just the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social totality that had become uncertain in this period, but the reproduction of the social totality as a whole, as evidenced by the consistent civil strife discussed above.</d-footnote>. Without such stable presuppositions, the sense of atemporality that derived from their role <em>as presuppositions</em> faded away, and although there was still a differentiation between sensible appearance and a supersensible content underlying it present, there was not a strong sense that this was accompanied by the corresponding temporal-atemporal distinction that was attached to it in both the preceding and succeeding conceptions. Even the sense that these are distinct planes of reality has now become confused; it is dirempted between the flattening entailed by it being a person’s heart or mind that serves as the object of the truth-appearance distinction and the heightening of the distinction to the point of separation implied in the anxiety over whether truth can be apprehended at all.</p> <p>Additionally, the opposition between the material body of money and its value had not been brought out into the full clarity that it would achieve after the introduction of coinage. In the distinction between legitimate and counterfeit coinage that undergirds Theognis’ conception of truth, it is the material body of money (its weight, purity, etc.) that distinguishes the true from the false, whereas, with the introduction of coinage, the heightened visibility of the difference between a coins value and the value of the metal it is coined from will reverse this relation—making it the abstract value rather than the material body of money that takes precedence—and thereby facilitate the transition to a conception of truth centered around the determinations of money as the embodiment of value, i.e. unity, universality and abstraction.</p> <p>It is the combination of both of these factors—the incomplete objectification of the primary social presuppositions and the underdevelopment of the opposition between use-value and value—that explains the peculiarities of Theognis conception of truth, especially the incompleteness and problematic character of it that led us to see it as intermediate or transitional. In the poems of Theognis a new conception of truth began to emerge from the husk of the old, just as in his social situation a new mode of production was being born from the crisis of the preceding forms. It is only with the consolidation of this new mode, whose fundamental moments were monetary mediation and the exploitation of slave labor, that the fledgling determination of truth glimpsed in his works was able to develop into the fully-fledged concept of essence that characterized the thought of the Pre-Socratic Monists.</p> <p>As we shall see in Part 3, this did not happen of its own accord—a brute movement of the economic base that resounded through the superstructure and can be interpreted on the basis of homology. It was rather a reciprocal process in which certain conceptions were taken up and developed by certain (class-determined) subjects in response to the economic and social transformations facing them and on the basis of the functionality of those conceptions for those subjects within the class struggle that situated them, and, perhaps, on an inability on the part of those subjects to recognize the true content of the value form.</p> <h2 id="3-pre-socratic-monism">3. Pre-Socratic Monism</h2> <h3 id="money--pre-socratic-monism-31">Money &amp; Pre-Socratic Monism (3.1)</h3> <p>It is now time to turn to the emergence of the concept of essence itself and begin to build an account of its socio-historical determination. In this section, I will build off of Richard Seaford’s account of the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic Monism in <em>Money and the Early Greek Mind</em> in order to establish a baseline conception of this relation. Then, in the next section, I will provide a critique of Seaford’s account, showing how it runs into many of the same pitfalls that we saw earlier in Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel. This critique will provide a basis for developing my own positive conception of this relationship and its broader socio-historical determination in the third section. There, I will argue that it is only by understanding the determination of the concept of abstract substance developed in PSM in terms of its <em>function</em> as part of an aristocratic ideological project in response to the crisis outlined above that we can explain it adequately.</p> <p>The great merit of Seaford’s analysis of the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic thought, and what sets him apart from Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel, is the attention he pays to the concrete conditions in which this relationship developed. In part, this attention to the concrete is probably a product of general intellectual orientation and training as a classicist, but it is also a result of his delimitation of his object of investigation to what he identifies as the emergence of a specifically metaphysical content in the thought of the Pre-Socratics.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175. See especially n. 2.</d-footnote> He describes this metaphysical content as “the counter-intuitive idea of a single substance underlying the plurality of things manifest to the senses,” which allows the Pre-Socratics to develop an “idea of the universe as an <em>intelligible order</em> subject to the <em>uniformity</em> of <em>impersonal</em> power,” and is distinguished as metaphysical by the “concern with reality as opposed to appearance, with what is fundamental as opposed to what is derivative, and with comprehensive as opposed to partial understanding.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 175.</d-footnote> Despite the inclusion in his description of broader cosmological considerations, concern with comprehensiveness, and the genesis of metaphysics as a discourse, all of which fall outside the scope of our own investigation (without therefore being dismissed as legitimate considerations), it is clear that the central determinations of this content are the same ones we have been describing as those of the concept of essence: unity, universality, abstraction and truth.</p> <p>The most important consequence of the concreteness enabled by this delimitation is that Seaford, unlike Marcuse or Sohn-Rethel, is able to offer an explanation of why the emergence of the concept of essence occurred at the specific time and in the specific places that it did. His answer to these questions will ultimately turn out to be incomplete, but they provide us with many of the building blocks out of which my own explanation will be built. For Seaford, the most important of these changes is the introduction of coinage, which both leads to an intensification of the pace and extent of monetization and to a development of the opposition between use-value and value inherent in money.<d-footnote>For the first, see especially, Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 126--9, 134--6, and 198--209; For the second, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 171.</d-footnote> He does a thorough job of demonstrating that these are the primary terms in which the social formations in which PSM emerged and developed can be differentiated from the others in which it did not.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175--89, 198--200, 209--10, and 244, n. 75.</d-footnote> As a result of this, we have a plausible case for identifying the rapid monetization and development of the opposition between use-value and value that followed the introduction of coinage as decisive conditions of the emergence and development of PSM, even if we can’t yet specify how this relationship was established.</p> <p>Seaford also further specifies the significance of these two factors to the development of PSM and its central concept of abstract substance in ways that align with our exposition at the end of Part 2. He argues that rapid monetization results in what he calls the “social transcendence” of “monetary value” which he aligns with the “integrative power” of money, that explains the impersonal cosmology of the Pre-Socratics.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote> Furthermore, it is the fetishism of the commodity, in which social relations become embodied in an external <em>thing</em>, a thing on which “individual autonomy and prosperity and collective cohesion and prosperity seem to depend,” that Seaford sees as the ground of the “unconscious cosmological projection” of the money form into the thought determinations of PSM (on which more below).<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote> All this points to the complete objectification of the function of reproducing the social presuppositions of the social formation as a whole that we highlighted as still missing in our analysis of the Theognis’ transitional form of truth above. It is the generalization of monetary mediation as result of the introduction of coinage that allows this objectification to be completed. Once it is, we find that truth too has achieved a stable form in the concept of abstract substance, in which the hierarchical ordering of levels of reality has become attached to the determinations of unity, universality and abstraction, which are themselves determinations of the money form and the abstract value it embodies. It has also begun to regain the sense of distinction between the planes and association of the true with atemporality that it had in bardic conception, although these would only become fully realized with the completion of the progressive abstraction of PSM in the thought of Parmenides.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 206, 211, 231, 237 and 244--6</d-footnote> This does not take us beyond the homology we have established in the preceding sections, but it does confirm it and expand our understanding of the grounds of its development in PSM.</p> <p>In a similar fashion, Seaford’s account of the development of the opposition between concrete use-value and abstract value in coinage confirms and expands our understanding of its role in the development of PSM. He argues that coinage brings out this opposition, in two ways. The first is by diminishing the importance of the material qualities of the metal (its weight, purity, etc.) in favor of abstract quantity (the determinations of unit and amount) and the second is by establishing a “systematic discrepancy between the conventional value of a coin and the concrete value of its bullion.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 171.</d-footnote> Together, these increase the visibility of the opposition between use-value and value, and in doing so bring forward the mysterious ideality of value, the way it appears to be an abstract, supersensible element of every commodity, and one that is independent of their concrete material properties and origins.<d-footnote>Cf. Marx, _Capital,_ vol. I, 163--4.</d-footnote> It is this same ideality that characterizes the abstract substance of PSM, which, like value, is conceived of as an abstract universal that unifies the diverse multiplicity of concrete sensible particulars that it is separated off from. Similarly, the progressive abstraction that Seaford emphasizes in the development of PSM from Thales to Parmenides follows the contours of the opposition between abstract value and its concrete monetary embodiment, moving from conceptions that resemble money in being themselves concrete objects separated off from all others as the universal equivalent, the object-type in which their qualitative differences are extinguished and equalized, to those that resemble value in being a pure abstraction, divested of material qualities except insofar as it is embodied in the things that represent its form of appearance.</p> <p>In addition to the introduction of coinage, Seaford’s concreteness allows him to specify a number of other important socio-historical conditions of the emergence of the concept of abstract substance, although, without an explicit concept of the mode of production, he is left to present them (for the most part) as an external aggregate of independent conditions, which prevents him from giving an adequate account of the determinate relationships between them. The most important of these are the crisis of the traditional social order centered around the warrior-aristocracy, the class struggle that accompanied the rise of the Tyrants, and the aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency.<d-footnote>It should be noted here that all three of these suggest an implicit recognition of the importance of the mode of production and its class structure for explaining the emergence and development of PSM, registering some of the effects of the transition that we described above without being able to articulate them together as moments of a totality.</d-footnote> In terms of the first two of these, aside from providing material that was used in constructing our account of the crisis described in Section 2.2 (and Appendix 2), the main thing that Seaford provides us with is confirmation that the social formations in which PSM developed were experiencing acute manifestations of that crisis.<d-footnote>Such as the fact that all of the _poleis_ in which PSM emerged and developed were either experiencing, or had recently experienced, the rule of a tyrant and/or heightened class antagonism. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 183.</d-footnote></p> <p>The third, on the other hand, introduces a new consideration, and one that will play an important part in my own conception of the social determination of PSM. Seaford introduces this ideological consideration in his discussion of Parmenides in order to explain the “problem of <em>why</em> value is abstracted from circulation.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 246.</d-footnote> He thinks that this abstraction of value from circulation lies at the basis of the differences between Parmenides’ concept of substance, which resembles monetary value in its total abstraction, and the substance concepts of his predecessors, which combine elements of both value and circulation in their relative concretion.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 246.</d-footnote> The aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency, which finds its <em>locus classicus</em> in Aristotle’s formulation that, “it is the mark of an <em>eleutheros</em> (free man, gentleman) not to live for the benefit of another,” is introduced as an external ideological factor that acts on the homologous relationship between money and the philosophical content of PSM, unconsciously motivating the separation of abstract value from concrete circulation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247; De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World_, 90, 116--7; 2014, _Rhetoric_, in _The Complete Works of Aristotle:The Revised Oxford Translation,_ ed. Jonathan Barnes, 2176 (1367a32), where the translation is "\...not to live at another's beck and call."</d-footnote> In doing so, it makes self-sufficiency, which Seaford thinks is already latent in the determination of value, into one of the central determinations that defines abstract substance.</p> <p>This ideological determination of PSM brings us closer to our own concern with its ideological character, although it doesn’t go far enough in that direction insofar as it posits the ideological as an external influence that shapes the development of the concept of abstract substance—and does so at a relatively late stage in this development. This relative externality of ideological considerations to the determination of the substance concept of PSM raises the question of what, for Seaford, differentiates the ideological character of the concept of self-sufficiency from the supposedly non-ideological character of the money-derived content of the concept of substance. Seaford does not explicitly spell this out, but it is clear from the way he discusses self-sufficiency that it must be the derivation of the former concept from the class structure of the social formations in question—and from the position of the aristocracy within that structure—that marks it as ideological.</p> <p>Following De Ste. Croix, Seaford describes the “ideology of economic self-sufficiency” as an expression of the “crucial opposition between those who by virtue of their command over the labor power of others were <em>free</em> to lead a civilized life (the ‘propertied class’) and those who had to work to maintain themselves.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247.</d-footnote> The class character of this ideology is introduced in this way only to be dropped and never mentioned again as the discussion turns back to the determination of self-sufficiency and its relation to the monetary determinations of substance.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247. It is also, as far as I can tell, the only time in which he makes explicit reference to the mode of production in _Money and the Early Greek Mind_.</d-footnote> This is what leads us to identify class origins as the distinguishing mark of ideological content for Seaford. It thereby also allows him to posit the other content of the concept of abstract substance in PSM as non-ideological insofar as it can be seen to <em>originate</em> from the determinations of the money form rather than from the class structure of the social formations in which that concept emerged and developed. This definition of ideology in terms of origins both obscures the ideological character of PSM as a whole and removes the questions of the mode of production and the reciprocal determination of its elements from consideration. As we shall see below, it is only by understanding PSM as determined from the beginning by its ideological function and class character that we can begin to offer an adequate explanation of its origins and development.</p> <h3 id="critiquing-seafords-formalism-32">Critiquing Seaford’s Formalism (3.2)</h3> <p>As I said at the beginning of the last section, Seaford’s account of the emergence and development of PSM gets us a long way towards our goal of explaining the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence. In this section, I will identify the aspects of Seaford’s analysis of the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic Monism that make it insufficient in relation to this goal. I will argue that this insufficiency is related to the formalistic framework of his project, which bears a number of similarities to the aspects of the works of Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel that I criticized at the beginning of this piece.</p> <p>The formalism of Seaford’s approach can be detected in both its aims and its method. It aims at showing that money, or monetization, is a necessary historical condition of possibility of the “genesis and form” of the “metaphysical preconceptions about the basic constituent of the world and its transformations” shared by the various pre-socratic philosophers, or, in other words, of “the counter-intuitive idea of a single substance underlying the plurality of things manifest to the senses.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greak Mind,_ 12 and 175.</d-footnote> Although this is not identical to the Kantian idealism that we saw in Sohn Rethel’s attempt to establish the necessary conditions of possibility of both “scientific cognition” and exchange itself in terms of the normative “postulates,” it still partakes of some of the same formalism, and even has something of the same form insofar as Seaford tends to frame his arguments about the monetary origin of said “preconceptions” in terms of their non-derivability from observation or deduction.<d-footnote>See, e.g. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 252.</d-footnote> The aim of this project is formalist insofar as it aims at establishing the formal grounds of the possibility of PSM, rather than explaining the <em>actuality</em> of its socio-historical determination.<d-footnote>The focus on giving a historical explanation of the seeming _apriority_ of its preconceptions adds to this formalism</d-footnote> It is the latter that is our aim here, and this involves giving an account of why, and how, the form determinations of money were taken up into thought (in a disguised form) as the content determinations of abstract substance, rather than simply establishing the necessity (or at least plausibility) of the origination of the latter in the former.</p> <p>Seaford’s argumentative method, while perhaps adequate to this aim, is constrained by the same formalism insofar as it centers around establishing that there is a (relatively complete) homology between the determinations of money and those of abstract substance, then eliminating other possible sources of the content of the latter (or assimilating them under the dominant influence of the monetary determinations on either historical or formal grounds (i.e. by showing the relative incompleteness of the homology between these and abstract substance), thereby establishing money as the source of those conceptual determinations.<d-footnote>See, e.g. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175--89, 205--9, 217--30 and 246--9. I am not primarily concerned here with the intrinsic weaknesses of this method, although I will note here that these center around the bad infinity of possible conditions and combinations of conditions that necessarily lie outside its eliminative procedure.</d-footnote> In this methodology, the aim of establishing money or monetization as a historical condition of possibility of the concept of monistic substance and the reliance on homology reciprocally determine each other. One the one had, It is only because the historical conditions of PSM are understood as conditions of possibility, and therefore formal conditions, that their “influence” on the latter is able to be analyzed primarily in terms of the formal relationship established by homology. On the other, it is only because that “influence” is understood in terms of homologous correspondence–which allows them to be understood as independent factors whose external conditioning of thought can be registered and isolated out in terms of the presence or absence of shared content–that Seaford is able to determine those historical conditions as <em>conditions of possibility</em> of the concept of abstract substance.<d-footnote>Even the dismissal of certain other conditions on the basis of historical, rather than formal, criteria would not be enough to identify monetization as the decisive condition that differentiates between the circumstances in which PSM emerged and those in which it didn't without the supplementary evidence supplied by the relatively more complete homology of the content determinations of money with those of PSM compared to those other factors.</d-footnote> This reciprocally determining formalism also explains the externality and independence of the conditions in their relationship to each other and to PSM that we noted in the last section, as well as their determination as origins or sources of the content of PSM.</p> <p>Seaford does attempt to offer an explanatory mechanism that could bridge the gap between socio-historical conditions of possibility and the actual relationship between thought and those conditions, but it is caught up in many of the same problems as his overall approach. His proposal for addressing both the why and the how of the homology between the money form and the substance concept of PSM is the “unconscious cosmological projection of abstract monetary substance.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 12.</d-footnote> He portrays this unconscious cosmological projection of money (or of its universal power and exchangeability) as a particular instance of a more general phenomenon in which cosmic order is unconsciously imagined on the basis of the dominant human social institutions in a given society.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 11 and 224--5. The inadequacy of unconscious cosmological projection as an explanation of the relationship between monetization and PSM can already be seen here in the slippage between monetary substance, which presumably refers to value as an _abstract object_ distinguishable from its _concrete monetary form of appearance_, and the universal power and exchangeability of money, which refer to _social functions_ of money arising from the concrete instantiation of value in the process and relations of exchange. Universal power in particular should not be seen as a property of money itself, but as a description of one of the social functions that it has for its possessors. This confusion about what exactly is being projected produces a certain looseness that facilitates the overall argument but simultaneously reduces its clarity and raises questions about its validity.</d-footnote> The determinate difference between PSM and other instances of this projection would then be the fact that the cosmic order takes on the abstract and impersonal determinations of money rather than, for example, the personal characteristics of the monarchical household or the redistributive form of the sacrificial feast.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 11 and 224--5.</d-footnote> In this conception, PSM, “like all representations of the cosmos…attempts to discover order and uniformity underlying apparent chaos.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote> Seaford thus suggests a transhistorical psychological mechanism that responds to a transhistorical psychological need for order and uniformity, in which objects are projected or “imagined” as a model for cosmological representation because they stand out as embodiments of order in their societies, and so can be “abstracted from the potential chaos of experience.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote></p> <p>The largest problem with this explanation is that the concept of projection itself is vague and Seaford does nothing to clarify the sense in which he is using it. As Laplanche and Pontalis had already pointed out in 1967, projection has been used in a number of different, often ill defined, senses, most of which can be reduced down to a general notion of displacement or externalization of an element (typically a psychological or neurological element).<d-footnote>Jean Laplanche and Jean-Bertrand Pontalis, _The Language of Psychoanalysis_, trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith (Routledge, 2018), 349.</d-footnote> In contrast to this is the psychoanalytic conception, in which this externalization is predicated on a rejection of or refusal to recognize the projected element (as belonging to the subject).<d-footnote>Laplanche, _Language of Psychoanalysis,_ 349.</d-footnote> Seaford gives no indication of using projection in the more specified psychoanalytic sense, despite this leaving no explanation for <em>why</em> this projection happens aside from a similarly vague (and, in my opinion, highly suspect) assertion of a transhistorical relation between cosmological representations and “attempts to discover order and uniformity underlying apparent chaos.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224. Note the similarity to Marcuse's 'quest for unity and universality.'</d-footnote> Indeed, the element supposed to be projected, “human institutions” which are the “elements of the familiar that “especially embody the order and uniformity that is abstracted from the potential chaos of experience,” is similarly indeterminate (and therefore both highly contestable and at the same time imbued with an immediate sense of plausibility).<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote> Not only that, but the unconscious nature of the proposed projection relies on a similarly underdetermined notion of the unconscious that leaves out the psychoanalytic emphasis on repression as a constitutive factor in unconscious operations, which leaves us with little idea as to what causes the unconscious repression and projection of social institutions, as opposed to a conscious transformation of the material in thought. Ultimately, the only answers Seaford provides as to why we should take unconscious cosmological projection to be the mechanism through which money determines the ideas introduced by PSM are non-answers insofar as they do little more than re-assert the existence of the formal correspondence established by his general approach—a correspondence they were meant to explain.</p> <p>Another reason for the inadequacy of Seaford’s account for our purposes is that he doesn’t give enough consideration to the <em>function</em> of PSM, or its central metaphysical concepts, within the broader social situation that they arise in, or within the determinate class relations that condition the individuals who developed it. This further consigns his explanation to its repetitive dependence on the homology between the money form and the concept of abstract substance and prevents him from escaping the charges of developing a reflection theory of socio-economic determination, despite his attempts to avoid the latter by acknowledging and integrating into his conception other sources of determination like political developments, mythological predecessors, ideological influences, and ego formation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 12 and 217--30.</d-footnote> To clarify, it is not that these factors do not play a part in the development of PSM but rather that acknowledging them without integrating them into a broader functional conception fails to recognizes the main problem with reflection theories, which lies in their formalism rather than their limited breadth, and, in doing so, reproduces that problem. It is to elaborating such a functional conception and showing how it allows us to bring together the disparate elements of our exposition up to this point that we shall turn in the next section.</p> <h3 id="the-emergence-of-essence-33">The Emergence of Essence (3.3)</h3> <p>In order to avoid the problems that we attributed above to the formalism of Seaford’s approach, we must return to the crisis of aristocracy, and the series of developing social crises it kicked off and remained entangled with, and understand PSM in terms of how it functioned as a response to those crises and their development. In particular, we should understand it as a response to acute moments of crisis by members of the aristocracy that had specific functions in relation to their class position. The acute crisis brought on by rapid monetization after the introduction of coinage would have brought into sharper focus the disjunction between the ideological and libidinal constitution of the aristocratic subject, whose lingering attachment to certain ideas, values, and forms of activity still corresponded to a significant extent to a position within older relations of production that no longer characterized the reality they found themselves in and had to navigate in order to reproduce themselves both as individuals and as a class.<d-footnote>This is especially true if we take into account Sartre's points about the importance of childhood and the class situation of the previous generations in ideological formation. See Jean-Paul Sartre, _Search for a Method_, trans. Hazel E. Barnes (Knopf, 1963), 57--65.</d-footnote></p> <p>In this light, the conceptual innovations of PSM should be seen as a part of the broader aristocratic response to the acute developments of this crisis brought on by the rapid monetization of the social formations in which they arose. In general, it functioned to refashion the ideological foundations of the rule, self-conception and general worldview of the aristocracy in response to the threats posed to them by crisis—and the role the previous aristocratic ideological forms continued to play in the development and perpetuation of said crisis. Earlier, we saw how neither the nostalgic omission characteristic of Homer’s early response to the crisis brought on by commercialization, nor the anxious denigration of Theognis’ response, was able to adequately orient them to these changing conditions. At the same time, we saw how the parallel development of commercialization and the crisis allowed this need for ideological reconfiguration to come out more clearly in the poems of Theognis—where the emptying out of the previous value system had already prompted the beginnings of a reorientation towards new ones—and how this was accompanied by a reconceptualization of truth that mirrored the (still incomplete) objectification of the social function of reproducing the presuppositions of the social formation as a whole. We should understand the development of Pre-Socratic Monism as a new stage in this development of the aristocratic response to crisis in which the rapid and pervasive monetization brought on by the introduction of coinage (along with the other features of coins mentioned above) allowed the early philosophers to develop an ideological account that was able to more adequately respond to the crises they faced.</p> <p>This functional conception aids our attempt to explain the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence in a number of ways. The first is by allowing us to develop a better account of the reasons for the isomorphism between the determinations of its concept of substance and the form-determinations of money. In order to more effectively respond to the social developments facing them, aristocrats in rapidly monetizing <em>poleis</em>, both individually and as a class, needed to develop a more adequate understanding of their societies. The crisis had created an unusual situation in which the reproduction of the exploiting class as a class required not so much a (more or less direct) reproduction of the ruling ideology, and its forms practice and “know-how”, as a <em>fundamental transformation of the ruling ideology</em> on the basis of which the exploiting class could refashion its misaligned and counter-productive forms of practice and “know-how.”<d-footnote>This conception of the ruling ideology and its relation to practice and "know-how" draws from Louis Althusser, _On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses_, trans. G.M. Goshgarian (Verso, 2014), 235--6.</d-footnote> So, when I say they needed to develop a more adequate understanding, I do not mean this simply in the sense of abstract or instrumental knowledge, but rather in the sense of a conceptual anchoring point, a reality schema, on the basis of which they could ensure the effectiveness of this reorientation.Their societies were increasingly constituted as interdependent totalities given unity by money as the singular concrete embodiment of the abstract value of commodities, for which they were universally exchangeable and in which they expressed their equivalence and interchangeability with each other. In positing the universe in a similar fashion, as an ordered impersonal totality in which multiplicity is given unity by a single universal substance, PSM provided a conceptual schema that corresponded to the new reality adequately enough to serve as a foundation for this necessary ideological realignment.<d-footnote>This does not mean that it was the only schema developed to fulfill such a function, or that it did so perfectly, although the lasting influence of its conceptual innovations attest to its success---at least among certain fractions of the aristocracy.</d-footnote> In this context, we can understand the isomorphism between its determinations and those of the money form as a consequence of the ideological demands made upon the aristocracy by the crisis.<d-footnote>It is important to note that it was not just the internal crisis of aristocracy that necessitated this ideological realignment but also the heightened conditions of class struggle and external social crisis that demanded their reconfiguration as a class.</d-footnote></p> <p>Our functional conception also allows us to return to the question we raised in Section 2.1 about the continuities between the Bardic conception of truth and the determination of truth in PSM, in which key elements of the earlier conception persisted despite the objectification of the social function of the bard, which eliminated the direct connection between speech and the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social totality—a connection on which the truth of that speech had rested. As I noted above, Theognis’ transitional conception of Truth did not just correspond to the (incomplete) objectification of the formerly subjective presuppositions, but also to the attempt to reconfigure aristocratic values and redefine aristocracy on the basis of those values, however limited that attempt may have been. This ideological project provides a functional reason for the retention of the concept of truth among both Theognis and the pre-socratics, despite the collapse of the social relationships in which the traditional conception had been embedded.<d-footnote>For the conception of a project used here, see Sartre, _Search for a Method_, 93--100; and Fredric Jameson, _Marxism and Form: Twentieth Century Dialectical Theories of Literature_ (Princeton University Press, 1974), 214--21.</d-footnote> The goal of that project was to reestablish, to the extent that they could, the position they had previously enjoyed before the crisis, and in particular before the usurpation of the tyrants, as well as the general challenging of their status from below by the broader lower classes connected to this usurpation. In response to these challenges, they looked back to the previous fount of aristocratic legitimacy and attempted to adapt it to the conditions they found themselves in.<d-footnote>This is supported by the explicit incorporation of more anachronistic mythico-religious elements connected to the traditional conception of truth in the presentation of the various pre-socratics, such as the residual mythological elements and aspects of the mystery cults that informed both the form and content of PSM, especially in the works of Heraclitus and Parmenides. See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 217--30 and 231--42; and Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 130--4.</d-footnote> The tension between this restorative tendency and the adaptive one discussed in the preceding paragraph goes a long way towards explaining the reasons why the traditional conception of truth was both partially retained and at the same time maintained its correspondence with the now objectified social presupposition of the social formation.</p> <p>There was a double reciprocality between the subjective project of the aristocratic proponents of PSM and the objective conditions in which that project was formulated. On the first level, the objective conditions determined the needs that the project constituted a response to and the class situation in which those needs and that response were situated, while the subjective project determined the specific way in which those needs would be taken up—i.e. in terms of the inherited traditions of the aristocratic subjects who formulated and developed that project and the promise of restoration that they held out. On the second level, the objective conditions also made it so that the subjective project could not be formulated along the same lines as it had been before. The objectification of the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social formation as a whole, and the need for a reality schema on which to base the project of ideological realignment, meant that the traditional concept of truth had to be reformulated, while, from the subjective side, the contours of that traditional conception seem to have determined that reformulation as a reformulation that retained its connection to the (now objective) social presuppositions.</p> <p>To fully understand this last point, we must examine the subjective reasons for retaining a conception of truth a little more closely. What was the appeal of a conception of truth for the aristocratic proponents of PSM? While we cannot say for certain, the most likely reason for this appeal, and the one that best explains the continued centrality of the social presuppositions to this conception, is that it has something to do with the <em>transcendence</em> enabled by the supersensible and atemporal aspects of truth, which was based on the <em>social</em> transcendence of the presuppositions of the social formation.<d-footnote>As we saw in Section 3.1, Seaford attributes this social transcendence to the "integrative power" of money, and the way in which it becomes a necessary form of mediation on which the individual and community both depend. This is not necessarily wrong, as both of these are aspects of its role as a presupposition of the social formation as a whole, but it does not fully grasp why that role makes it socially transcendent. As I argued in Section 2.1, it was the place of the cultural presuppositions reproduced by the bard outside of the sensuous activity of the community as conditions of communal production that were not themselves produced by the community that constituted their social transcendence. With money, the situation is similar, although it is produced by the community. The reason why it still functions as a presupposition despite being produced as a part of the communal labor is because of the way that the process of commercialization individualizes social production and posits money as the sole representative of the _sociality_ of labor. In this way, money can be seen as socially transcendent insofar as it stands outside the individual processes of production that constitute the total social labor and, though itself produced, is separated off from the rest of social production as the ground of its determination as _social_ production.</d-footnote> This transcendence allowed the aristocratic proponents of PSM to eternalize their position in the relations of exploitation, which was beneficial as a means of both legitimating the aristocracy as a whole, and of strengthening the claims of their ideological project in relation to other aristocratic ideologies that did not invoke the same transcendence (and which likely represented newer, more commercialized class fractions).<d-footnote>On this last point, see Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 107--10.</d-footnote></p> <p>We can see here how the function of legitimating the rule of the aristocracy, which, in Section 2.1, we separated out in discussing the social function of the bard in as the less important side in terms of understanding the determination of truth, actually played a role in the persistence of that determination after the concrete relations in which it was embedded dissolved, and of its connection to the social transcendence of the social presuppositions. Without the direct connection that existed between bardic speech and the reproduction of those presuppositions, it was this function of legitimation and its connection to that transcendence that maintained the overall connection between truth and the now-objectified presuppositions. At the same time both the dissolution of that direct connection and the objectification of those presuppositions meant that truth had to be configured differently to maintain its general ideological functionality.<d-footnote>For example, the truth of a statement could no longer be seen as attached to the social position of the speaker, but instead had to be understood as independent and objective, and so (in principle) universally accessible, but, at the same time, increasingly contestable and relative insofar as its independence and objectivity separated it from its connection to any specific individual.</d-footnote></p> <p>The third way in which our functional conception of PSM helps us is by allowing us to specify the relationship between the monetary content of PSM and the aristocratic ideology of self-sufficiency that we discussed in Section 3.1. This ideology of self-sufficiency, already recognizable in Homer, increasingly revealed itself to be the bedrock on which the distinction between aristocrat and non-aristocrat could be made as the monetary confusions of the crisis were worked out and weaker elements of the traditional concept of aristocracy, like heredity, fell to the wayside as the class was reconstituted along the lines set out by the transforming mode of exploitation and commercialization.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World_, 114--7; Moses Finley, _The World of Odysseus_ (New York Review Books, 2002), 68--70.</d-footnote> In this sense, it both pre-existed the developments of PSM and had a certain centrality to the ideological project of the aristocracy as a whole that exceeded the bounds of the specific project that animated PSM. So, to a certain extent, Seaford was right to pose it as external to PSM, but, by understanding it as a supplementary influence that modified and introduced extraneous content to the money-derived content of PSM, he did not understand the way in which the two were co-constitutive in the formulation of PSM and reciprocally determined one another.</p> <p>Both the reconfiguration of truth according to the determinations of the money form and the definition of aristocracy in terms of self sufficiency should be seen as part of the same project of ideological realignment that represented the subjective moment of the determination of PSM. The ideology of self-sufficiency centered around an abstract negation of dependence that allowed the aristocrat to be distinguished from both the commoner and the slave (and from women, who, even if part of an aristocratic household, were considered dependent on the male householder), and made the definition of aristocracy the same as that of freedom, which as a moral ideal provided both a justification for aristocratic rule and a normative standard on which individual conduct could be guided and evaluated, and thereby brought into line with the continuing reproduction of the mode of exploitation.<d-footnote>This alignment of aristocracy and freedom also played a significant role in bringing the conduct of the democratic _polis_ as a whole into line with the reproduction of the relations of exploitation in so far as political freedom took on the same determinations and thereby shaped the norms and expectations of inter-_polis_ relations and conduct for the citizen body in general.</d-footnote> The importance of this emphasis on self-sufficiency can be seen not just in the later developments of a figure like Parmenides, as Seaford emphasizes, but already in one of the earliest formulations of the doctrine of PSM, that of Anaximander, whose <em>apeiron</em>, aside from taking on the determinations of money (especially in its function as means of circulation), is said to have no beginning, and to surround and steer all things.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 192. Seaford does suggest the possibility of earlier influences of the ideology of self-sufficiency, but only traces it back to Xenophanes, merely raises the possibility without following through on it, and does not see how much of a constitutive role it plays in the overall substance conception of PSM. See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 212 and 248.</d-footnote> This connection of abstract substance with stasis and independence clearly has something to do with the transcendence of truth that we discussed above, but its specific form, especially the way in which the <em>apeiron</em> “steers all things” from its position of static independence, bears a significant resemblance to the ideology of self-sufficiency and the aristocratic class position on which it was based.</p> <p>If we take a closer look at that class position in relation to the monetized economy of the <em>polis</em>, and the way in which aristocratic ideology represents a one-sided abstraction that covers over the contradictions inherent in that relation, this resemblance becomes even more telling. As the primary owners of the land and slaves through which the surplus product, on which the whole monetary economy of the polis was based, was appropriated, the aristocracy did indeed have a certain foundational independence in relation to that economy. At the same time, this appearance of independence, which expressed itself in the one-sided abstraction of the ideology of self-sufficiency, was matched by a reciprocal dependence on the slaves whose surplus labor supported their consumption, on the commodified division of labor that was inseparable from said surplus appropriation, and on the goods (and services) they received in exchange for the products of the surplus labor they appropriated, without which they could not have lived as they did.<d-footnote>This one sided appearance of independence was strengthened by the fact that, as owners of agricultural land and slaves to work it, most aristocrats could hypothetically have supported themselves and their households without engaging in exchange, although probably only temporarily and, again, not in the concrete ways in which they actually lived. Furthermore, the goods that supported both the immediate consumption of the aristocracy and the exchange they engaged in had become their property neither as a result of their own labor nor through exchange, so that when they were exchanged (or consumed), they appeared to a certain extent as not just a foundation, but an unproduced foundation, separated both spatially and socially from the process of becoming that gave rise to it. From the perspective we developed above in relation to the social presuppositions of the social formation, it could be said that the ideology of self-sufficiency had its roots in aristocratic control of the other major presuppositions of the social formation, land and slaves, from which it obtained its own transcendence..</d-footnote> From the perspective of this one-sided self-sufficiency, the aristocracy could appear as a static, unproduced foundation of the social formation as a whole, one which steered the whole world of exchange-mediated activity and covered over the aristocracy’s own dependence on both that world of exchange and the slaves whose labor provided the foundation of their existence and social position. It was this one-sided abstraction of the aristocratic position in terms of independence that was transferred to the abstract substance of PSM and increasingly made self-sufficiency into one of its core determinations.</p> <p>This combination of determinations derived from the money form and the ideology of self-sufficiency (or the contradictory objective situation that it covered over) were complementary and helped to stabilize each other. The determination of truth as essence allowed the proponents of PSM to compensate for the one-sidedness of aristocratic self-sufficiency by aligning independence with true reality and consigning the side of aristocratic dependence to the inessential (and, following the absolute distinction posited by Parmenides, <em>untrue</em>) world of becoming. It also supplemented the ideological function of distinguishing between aristocrats and non-aristocrats on the basis of self-sufficiency with a positive account of their right to rule on the basis of intellectual superiority or access to truth. The determination of self sufficiency, on the other hand, allowed them to cohere and stabilize the concept of abstract substance itself in its reflection of the contradiction between the abstract value and concrete embodiment of money.<d-footnote>This is evidenced by the progressive abstraction of the substance concepts of the pre-socratics (which will be discussed more below), which was accompanied by an increasing prominence of the determination of self-sufficiency. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 244.</d-footnote> It also counteracted (to some extent) the deprivileging of truth that had resulted from the objectification of the social function of the bard by re-establishing a connection between truth and the position of the aristocrat.<d-footnote>This was also aided by the class position of the aristocracy itself, which both ensured that they were the main people who had the free time necessary for metaphysical inquiry and, by separating them from the immediate process of production, promoted their development of an abstract consciousness suited to those pursuits.</d-footnote> Together, these factors allowed the aristocratic proponents of PSM to depict themselves as the expositers of an esoteric (even if <em>in principle</em> universal) doctrine that granted access to true reality in opposition to the mere appearance of everyday life, but only for the few whose social position identified them with that truth and enabled them to reach the heights of abstract intellect needed to understand that doctrine.</p> <p>Our functional conception of PSM has already allowed us to develop a much more concrete conception of the emergence of the concept of essence in PSM, but there is one crucial question left to be answered in order to fill out this picture. This is the question of why the determinations of money took the form of cosmological or metaphysical determinations about the universe, or why they were displaced from their social context into the cosmological/metaphysical register. The first likely reason for this is that despite the innovativeness of their new conception, the early philosophers still did not produce it from thin air. The thinkers in the tradition of PSM needed to draw on the ideological resources present to them in order to refashion them, and these were largely cosmological and mytho-poetic.<d-footnote>See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 217--30.</d-footnote> As the tradition developed, we can see a progressive detachment from these origins, what some have referred to as a secularization, but never a full break.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 89--106 and 130.</d-footnote> The second reason is that despite needing to develop a conception that allowed them to orient themselves within the newly and increasingly monetized social world they lived in, explaining that world, or the mechanisms of its monetary mediation, was not the primary (implicit or explicit) aim of their accounts. These accounts responded to the conflict and confusion caused by the misalignment between aristocratic ideology and its social conditions, and its primary function should be seen in terms of refashioning that ideology rather than directly explaining those conditions. In fact, the latter aim probably wouldn’t have been a legible project given the ideological foundations that served as their starting point—although it would become one for a figure like Aristotle, but only after the ideological and philosophical changes that PSM inaugurated had developed and entrenched themselves. The third, and most significant, reason brings us back to the critique of Seaford’s unconscious cosmological projection that I made above. I mentioned there that Seaford’s use of the psychological concepts of projection and the unconscious ignored the psychoanalytic specification of these mechanisms in terms of a negative reaction to some content that is unable to be recognized. From this perspective, we can see the displacement of the determinations of money from their social context into the realm of pure thought as a response to some aspect(s) of the social content of the former that they were unable (or unwilling) to recognize, or, to put it in more Jamesonian language, we can see it as an imaginary solution to the real contradiction between money or monetization and their own class position and ideological project.<d-footnote>Jameson, _The Political Unconscious_, 79.</d-footnote></p> <p>The primary contradiction that motivated this displacement was between the equality of abstract human labor, which is posited by the money form, and the relations of exploitation that determined the class position of the aristocracy, which posited an inequality between the labor of slaves and that of free men. Marx himself notes this as an explanation for Aristotle’s inability to develop a concept of value in the first chapter of <em>Capital.</em> He says that “Aristotle himself was unable to extract this fact, that, in the form of commodity values, all labor is expressed as equal human labor and therefore as labor of equal quality, by inspection from the form of value, because Greek society was founded on the labor of slaves, hence had as its natural basis the inequality of men and of their labor-powers.”<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 151--2. Although it is clear that Aristotle was able to turn the concept of essence back on the original context from which its primary determinations originated, it is also clear that this is a secondary application of the primarily metaphysical concept, and therefore still dependent on the distancing effected by the original displacement, and also that he was still unable to directly apply it to the analysis of value or money itself, whose essence he cannot identify, leading him to declare it inessential and untrue.</d-footnote> If we take the class-situated demand for ideological realignment made by the crisis and the objectification of the social function of the bard as the positive grounds of the functionally-determined taking up of the money form by PSM, then we can take this contradiction between the equality posited by money and the inequality posited by slavery (which has its roots in the same conditions that produced the crisis and its demands) as the negative ground that determined that taking up as a displacement into the cosmological/metaphysical register. We can also see how the ideological project itself further determined the inability to take up this contradiction, which would have stood in opposition to its aim of legitimizing the position of the aristocracy in the relations of exploitation.</p> <p>There is another way in which this equality posited by the money-form may have served as a negative ground of the development of PSM. In order to posit the equality of different concrete labors, money must simultaneously posit them as homogenous fractions of the total social labor. In exchanging their products for money, the owners of those products posit the labor that went into them as as equal not to a specific other kind of labor, but rather to all other kinds of labor that have their equivalent in money, and this is what allows the value of the different products of those labors to appear “as values of quantitatively comparable magnitude.”<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 159.</d-footnote> In doing so, those owners posit their labor in relation to the sum total of the labor in their society, but in an externalized form, as a relation between objects, rather than as a relation between people.<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 164.</d-footnote> At the same time, the process of commercialization that gives rise to money increases the division of labor and in doing so it also increases the degree of interdependence between the producers, integrating previously independent branches of production, and communities, into the unified division of labor of a broader social formation.<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 471-2.</d-footnote> This means that money, along with the commercialization process that it represents the formal culmination of, makes a number of independent communities into an interdependent social totality in a new and more comprehensive way, turns the implicit and subjective unity of those communities (in which which the primary processes of production had, for the most part, been conducted on the basis of the independent household with the function of reproducing that household) into an explicit and objective one, and, at the same time, obscures the social character and interdependence of the various labor processes which it brings into relation and thereby constitutes as fractions of the total social labor, and does so exactly insofar as it enacts that objectification.<d-footnote>Contra Marx, I think that the way in which the commodity and money forms constitute labor as a fraction of a social whole should also be understood as the basis of the qualitative equality of the different labors objectified in the process of exchange. Marx's proposal, that it is their physiological equality insofar as they are expenditures of human muscles, nerves, etc. that forms the basis of their commensurability as quantities of abstract labor, relies on something external to the commodity form to explain the equalization posited by it. While this remains a possibility, it seems more likely to me that the equalization posited by the commodity form has its basis in an aspect of that form itself rather than in an external abstraction, the concrete derivation of which from the act of exchange seems unclear. Exchange itself, and especially monetary exchange, posits the different labors as social at the same time as it posits them as equal, so it seems reasonable to look for the basis of their equality in the sociality posited along with it. In fact, as we saw above, the quantitative comparability of commodities (in which their equality is expressed) is itself based on their exchangeability not with each other directly, but with the embodiment of abstract social labor. This allows us to identify the equality between the labor embodied in exchanged commodities and the quantitative determination of their value as labor _time_ as both having their origin in the way in which exchange posits the different labors as a fraction of the total social labor, with the former deriving from the socialization it effects and the latter from the externalization. It also suggests a possible basis in the commodity form itself for the persistent reappearance of assertions of the inequality of human beings under capitalism, in the form of theoretical and practical racism, despite the tendency to acknowledge the realization of formal equality on the basis of the wage relation. On this account of the origins of equalization, that persistent tendency to racialization could be understood as having its basis in the commodity form insofar as 1) the necessarily nation-state-based organization of capitalist social formations whose economic self-identity is expressed in the differential exchange rates between different national currencies keeps the world broken up into a multiplicity of separate social totalities, which provides a material basis for denying the extension of the principle of formal equality beyond the bounds of the national community (and the derivative ideological expansion of this denial to include members of the racist's nation who can be imaginatively identified as foreign), and 2) the continuing inability to recognize the social content of the commodity form due to the externalized form of social totality posited by the commodity, and the fetishism resulting from it, also undermines the recognition of equality by obscuring its origins and contributing to its ideological slipperiness insofar as it provides a basis for its continuing determination as abstract, merely formal equality. On the national organization of capitalist social formations and the exchange rates between national currencies, see John Milios and Dimitris P. Sotiropoulos, _Rethinking Imperialism: A Study of Capitalist Rule_ (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), 105--8 and 154--9.</d-footnote> As we saw above, the ideology of self-sufficiency was based in the one-sided abstraction away from the interdependent side of this contradiction, and so recognizing this sociality would have further prevented PSM from fulfilling its function insofar as it undermined the functionality of that ideology.</p> <p>This explanation of the displacement also allows us to understand the process of progressive abstraction that we discussed above, in which the attempt to identify the nature of the underlying substance moved from candidates that resembled the concrete use-value of money to candidates that resembled its abstract value.<d-footnote>See Section 3.1.</d-footnote> Now, we can see how the contours of that development, as well as the confusion that prompted it, were results of this negative ground of the displacement of the money form. It was the way in which this displacement and its grounds (along with the inherent fetishism of the money form) obscured the <em>actual substance</em> of value—abstract labor—that determined the form of PSM as a identificatory search and determined the poles within which the development took place. It was because this actual substance was inaccessible that the concept of substance arose in the form of a question as to the identity of that substance, and that the contours of the development took place between the contradictory poles of that substance’s form of appearance, the relation between which cannot be reconciled without a notion of that substance itself.</p> <p>This absence created an instability in the conceptual content of the early formulations of PSM in which it oscillated between the poles of the contradiction, and it was the determination of self sufficiency that helped stabilize this oscillation by driving the process of progressive abstraction noted by Seaford. As PSM developed, there was a simultaneous increase in the prominence of self sufficiency in the substance concepts of its proponents and in the abstraction of that concept as it moved from a greater resemblance to concrete money toward one to abstract value, until, with Parmenides concept of abstract Being, the determinations of truth became completely identified with determinations of self-subsistent abstract value.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 244.</d-footnote> This is not necessarily to say that Parmenides’ conception more adequately reflects the substance of value, which, though abstract, is the result of a process of mediation that it cannot be separated from (which probably makes it more akin to Heraclitus’ conception and its “reversible exchange”), but rather that in it the one-sided abstraction of value and the one-sided abstraction of self-sufficiency developed into a relatively stable form in which each covered over the defects of the other—thus bringing to a close the first first phase of the development of the concept of essence in Ancient Greece in which the question of substance, of identifying the <em>arche</em>, was primary.<d-footnote>For a discussion of "reversible exchange" in Heraclitus, see Chris Kassam, "Heraclitus, Seaford and Reversible Exchange," _The Journal of Speculative Philosophy_ 31, no. 4 (2017): 609--33, &lt;https://doi.org/10.5325/jspecphil.31.4.0609&gt;. I think that Kassam overemphasizes the extent to which the reversibility of exchange in Heraclitus negates the increased level of abstraction that Seaford identifies there. It seems clear to me that Heraclitus posits substance as the inseparable unity of both the abstract self-subsistence of the one and the concrete becoming of the many, while at the same time privileging the one as the underlying moment and ground of the truth of the movement. My favorite example of this is D50 (B54), which Laks and Most translate as "Invisible fitting-together (_harmoniê_), stronger than a visible one." Besides already asserting the precedence of invisible harmony, and so the abstract moment, in terms of its content, this fragment also enacts it formally. The greek text is structured as two pairs of oppositions, an inner opposition between _aphanēs_ (invisible) and _phanerēs_ (visible), which itself has a visible harmony in terms of its morphology, and an outer opposition between _harmoniê_ (fitting-together/harmony) and _kreíttōn_ (stronger), the latter of which originally meant superiority granted to the warrior-aristocrat by the gods and was connected to the idea of domination and came to have a distinct physical/martial sense compared to the other comparative forms that were used to mean 'better.' This seems to be an unreconciled contradiction both visibly and in terms of meaning, but, in the context of the sentence, there is an invisible harmony insofar as the outer terms both determine the relationship between the terms of the inner opposition, with the first providing a substrate of sorts for the meaning of visible and invisible (as both referring to harmonies) and the second providing the structure of their relation. Thus, the outer terms not only create an invisible harmony between the inner terms but also reconcile their own opposition through that act of providing invisible harmony to the inner opposition. It is this invisible harmony that establishes the harmony of the fragment as a whole, that reconciles the opposition between form and content and into which it had divided itself.

This crisis, and the misalignment it caused between the ideological constitution of the aristocracy and objective conditions they found themselves in, created a demand for fundamental ideological realignment that the Pre-Socratic Monists attempted to meet. To do so, they took up and adapted the traditional conception of truth as a means of both reasserting the legitimacy which it had conferred upon their predecessors and providing a reality schema on the basis of which the required reorientation could be grounded. This meant reconfiguring that conception on the basis of the determinations of money, which had taken the place of the customary and cultural traditions reproduced by the bard as the social presupposition of the social totality. At the same time, the contradiction between the substance of value and the position of the aristocracy required the determinations of money to be taken up in a disguised form in order to retain their functional value, displacing them into the cosmological/metaphysical register. But, this reconfiguration of truth on the basis of the displaced form determinations of money could not fulfill the ideological function demanded of it by the crisis on its own. It both required supplementation from, and helped cover over the one-sidedness of, the pre-existing and developing aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency, which provided a basic definition of the aristocrat on the basis of their place in the relations of exploitation, helped stabilize the conceptual confusion caused by the displacement of money, and determined the development of the concept of substance towards increasing abstraction and correspondence with abstract value rather than its concrete embodiment in money.</p> <h2 id="4-conclusion">4. Conclusion</h2> <h3 id="methodological-conclusions-41">Methodological Conclusions (4.1)</h3> <p>At the beginning of this piece, I said that in it I would focus on laying the groundwork for a larger project with two aims: providing a historical materialist account of the origins and development of the concept of essence and developing a Marxist theory of essence that facilitates the project of revolutionary praxis in the present. It is now time to evaluate our progress on these fronts, although, due to the preliminary nature of our investigation, what we will be able to say about the latter will necessarily be more abstract and provisional than what we can say about the former.</p> <p>The contribution made by this piece with respect to the first aim can be broken up into two categories. The first is the confirmation and development of certain theoretical and methodological principles and the second is the provision of a baseline understanding of the emergence of the concept of essence itself in the Greek context. In terms of methodology, the main principles whose fruitfulness I believe has been shown in the course of our investigation, and which I would like to highlight here are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Any explanation of the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence must be grounded in a reconstruction of the concrete historical material corresponding to particular social formations rather than transhistorical determinations or teleological schemas that determine that material retrospectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Such a reconstruction must itself have its basis in the mode of production and its transformations considered as a total social process in which relatively independent spheres and elements reciprocally condition one another in an asymmetrical fashion that gives priority to the broadly economic base.<d-footnote>See Appendix 1 for a more in depth examination of this principle.</d-footnote></p> </li> <li> <p>Attention must be paid to uneven character of such a process, and especially to the lag between the ideological and subjective elements and the economic base, such as we saw in the case of the misalignment between the ideological constitution of the aristocratic subject and the demands imposed upon them by their changing position in the class structure of their social formations.</p> </li> <li> <p>The identification of a homology between conceptual or ideological elements and economic or more broadly social ones can serve as a starting point for investigation and indicator of a connection between those elements and their conditions of possibility, but this identification must be surpassed to offer a proper explanation.</p> </li> <li> <p>A key element of any such explanation is a functional account of the taking up of certain of the objective contents of such a homology into thought.</p> </li> <li> <p>Such a functional account should involve the two moments of class-situated <em>response</em> to the objective situation and subjective project oriented towards intervening in class struggle–and so acting on the objective conditions that solicited the response.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Principles 4–6 in particular represent the methodological <em>results</em> of the investigation undertaken here, and though they remain open to revision or qualification on the basis of further study, I believe that they provide a strong foundation upon which to conduct such study. One way of viewing such a contribution is as an extension of the Hegelian determination of the concept as purposive activity that takes up and transforms its external conditions, and its Marxist reformulation in terms of labor, to the question of the socio-historical determination of philosophy.<d-footnote>For the Hegelian conception of the concept, see Karen Ng, "From Actuality to the Concept in Hegel's Logic" in _The Oxford Handbook of Hegel_, ed. Dean Moyar (Oxford University Press, 2017). For the Marxist conception, see Marx, _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1884_, 75. See also Appendix 1.</d-footnote> From this perspective, we could generalize them into the principle that <em>the determination of thought by its objective conditions always involves activity on the part of individuals according to their subjective purposes in relation to those conditions.</em></p> <h3 id="historical-conclusions-42">Historical Conclusions (4.2)</h3> <p>On the side of the historical content of the emergence and development of the concept of essence, the conclusions outlined at the end of Section 3.3 provide us with a starting point for constructing a broader narrative of that development up to the present. At the same time, we cannot assume a continuity in either the content or function of the concept of essence after this first phase, and so that construction would require a renewed effort of historical reconstruction of the development of both the concept itself and the conditions in which it developed. It is very possible that its persistence and development, if these can be established, resulted from its taking on different functions for different individuals and class fractions in different periods and circumstances. There is also a need for examining other regions like India and China in which a concept of essence seemed to emerge independently around the same time and incorporating those developments into our overall narrative.<d-footnote>Seaford's _The Origins of Philosophy in Ancient Greece and Ancient China_ could provide a good starting point for this work.</d-footnote> Additionally, it seems likely that in attempting to track the further development of the concept of essence after its emergence, further attention would need to be paid to the relative autonomy of philosophical development as it matures and becomes institutionalized. Still, the above account of the relationship between money and the concept of essence suggests a few candidates for explaining the apparent persistence of that concept under different modes of production and concrete circumstances that seem like fruitful areas for further investigation.</p> <p>The first is the connection between the reconfiguration of truth and the emergence of essence. Since it was the monetized objectification of the social presuppositions that determined the contours of the reconfiguration of truth at the heart of the emergence of the concept of essence, this also seems like a good place to look in terms of generating research questions on the basis of which to investigate the persistence of that concept. Is there a persistent connection between the determinations of essence and the role of money as a preposition of social production? Or between essence (or truth) and the general presuppositions regardless of whether or not these are monetary? Or, is this just a condition of their emergence that ceases to play a role in their persistence as time goes on? What happens when capital takes up both the monetary and non-monetary presuppositions into its own process of realization? Similarly, it seems like the negative conditioning of that emergence due to the inability to recognize the substance of value raises a similar set of questions. In particular, the question of whether the persistence of the displacement at the core of the emergence of the concept of essence has its basis in a continuing inability to recognize the equality and interdependence of human labor seems fruitful, and I have already given some provisional indications of how this continuity might manifest itself under capitalist relations of production in note 126. These are just two possible avenues of inquiry suggested by the project undertaken above, but I think they already provide a more promising basis for developing a concrete account of the history of the concept of essence than those currently available.</p> <h3 id="practical-conclusions-43">Practical Conclusions (4.3)</h3> <p>There is a significant historical distance between the object of my investigation here and revolutionary practice in the present day that makes it harder to evaluate its practical significance, so all of the following will have an even more provisional and suggestive character than even the historical conclusions discussed above. Still, I think elements of the research conducted here can help direct our attention in some pertinent directions in terms of developing a marxist concept of essence adequate to the task of facilitating contemporary revolutionary praxis. Before getting into this, I think it is important to point out that my research has led me to rethink Marcuse’s assumption that truth is a subordinate determination of the concept of essence, and to recognize that it was rather essence that appeared to be a form of the concept of truth, a reconfiguration of it on the basis of changing material conditions and ideological imperatives. It will take further research to determine how this relationship continued to be reconfigured over time, so, for now I will speak of the concept of essence with the understanding that it may in fact be the concept of truth in general that I’m attempting to refer to.</p> <p>The first practical consideration I want to discuss has to do with the points made in section 3.3 about the function of essence as both a reality schema used to ground practic-ideological reorientation and as a means of legitimation of the place of the ruling class in the mode of exploitation. On the one hand, I think that the connection between essence and legitimation calls into question its usefulness for a revolutionary project, in which case it might only be the critique of the concept of essence that is useful to us—insofar as it provides us with a means of dispelling the connection between reality indexing and legitimation propagated by that concept. On the other hand, any revolutionary project itself needs a means of effecting practico-ideological reorientation on the basis of current realities, and this might be one of the ways in which a Marxist concept of essence would be valuable, although it would require disentangling these two functions in such a way that its reality schema could be based not on the reproduction of the current relations of production but instead on their overthrow. How to do this, and whether we need to, remain open questions, but I think the research undertaken here has provided a useful basis for beginning to think these questions through.</p> <p>The second practical consideration relates to the negative grounds discussed near the end of section 3.3 and to Marcuse’s assertion of a relation between essence and freedom. I hope that my overall argument has served to dispel the notion that the concept of essence has any positive connection to any substantive idea of freedom that is not premised on exploitation. At the same time, I do think that the role of the negative grounds of an inability to recognize the equality and interdependence posited by the money form could indicate a negative and indirect relationship between the concept of essence and freedom, although this would require more historical work to verify. If the inability to recognize this content and/or opposition to the implications of its realization continued to provide a foundation for the maintenance of the projected determinations of money as metaphysical determinations in the concept of essence, then we should see this content as the continually returning repressed content that haunts thought throughout the history of philosophy, and the concept of essence as preserving the possibility of the realization of equality and interdependence in a negative manner, as that which cannot be realized in order for it to continue to function conceptually. We could also see this as part of the reason why the concept of essence is able to function as a reality schema for monetized social totality, which itself relies on the non-realization of substantive equality and direct interdependence in order to continue to exist as self-externalized social totality. Ultimately, freedom, in its adequate form as collective self-determination, is derivative of these latter determinations insofar as it is premised on the absence of exploitation and the directly collective self-determination of social production and reproduction, without which the possibility of purposive control of the production apparatus and the free mediation of the relationship between human beings and nature according to consciously determined purposes are impossible. Whether we determine that it is solely the critique of the concept of essence or also its reformulation that facilitates revolutionary practice today, we should take this primacy of equality and interdependence into account and orient ourselves more towards them than towards the freedom that would follow from them, or, in other words, we should orient ourselves towards freedom only insofar as it is seen as a product of the instantiation of substantive equality and collective mediation of our interdependent social production.</p> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Althusser, Louis. <em>On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses</em>.
