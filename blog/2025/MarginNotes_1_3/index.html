The result of this flood is that the term now usually connotes a mere pejorative rather than anything of substance. Anyone who wishes to avoid submersion must seek higher ground. Yet academia has shown itself to be a lowland compared to those who have merged theoretical insight with practical activity. It is little wonder, then, that the most coherent conceptions of ideology come from those who stand in large part outside the academy. For this reason, any investigation into ideology must start with the insight of the Young Marx, who noted that philosophy had contended itself with criticizing thought in its abstract form. This was a half-complete task; it did not criticize the real conditions which give rise to illusory abstractions.<d-footnote>See Karl Marx, "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's *Philosophy of Right*: Introduction" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1978), 53-65.</d-footnote> If the Young Prussian was correct that on the other side of the antinomy stood the proletariat, ready to pick up theory as a weapon of its own emancipation, then it should be unsurprising that the most thorough critics of ideology stand on its side.</p> <p>The ambiguous relationship of the Frankfurt School to academia provided fertile ground for a critical theory of ideology. This ambiguity was not of the members’ volition. Misfortunes asserted themselves upon the group but also allowed for reason to work its cunning. The concept of ideology played a central role in the Frankfurt School from the time of Horkheimer’s ascent as director of the <em>Institut für Sozialforschung</em> (IfS). Of course, the Frankfurt School was not the first to investigate the concept. Indeed, one of the first treatments of the concept in the Frankfurt School corpus criticizes extant theories of ideology. However, by dint of their influence and voluminous output, the Frankfurt School’s conception of ideology is a watershed moment in the development of the concept. At its head during these halcyon years was Max Horkheimer, who somewhat facetiously accepted previous director Carl Grünberg’s description of the IfS as a “dictatorship of the director.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "The Present Situation of Social Philosophy" from *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, trans. G. Frederick Hunter, Matthew S. Kramer, and John Torpey (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1993), 11.</d-footnote> His productive flurry during his stint as the head of the IfS deserves special consideration for both its historical breadth and theoretical acumen. It is for this reason that the essay will focus predominantly on Horkheimer, though it will at times refer to other members of the IfS as needed.</p> <p>Horkheimer’s 1930 critique of Karl Mannheim’s <em>Ideology and Utopia</em> is a fruitful starting point for an explanation of the critical theory of ideology. Mannheim’s theory not only has historical importance but is also a useful case study in how abstract and value-free theories of ideology content themselves with retreating to abstraction rather than explaining how ideology functions in the social reproduction of concrete life. By contrast, the theory of ideology that the <em>Institut für Sozialforschung</em> develops is an antidote to these common maladies. Hence, this essay first describes Horkheimer’s criticism of Mannheim in section 2 before laying out the concept of ideology that Horkheimer developed during the 30s. Those unfamiliar with Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge should consult Appendix 3 to orient themselves before continuing.</p> <p>After laying out Horkheimer’s critique of Mannheim, the essay then turns to Horkheimer proper. This section, section 3, forms the bulk of the essay (for obvious reasons), and is for that reason divided into subsections. Subsection 3.1 mainly summarizes the main problems with the sociology of knowledge and lists the pitfalls that a critical theory of ideology should avoid. Next, subsection 3.2 distinguishes between <em>Ideologietheorie</em> and <em>Ideologiekritik</em>, and I argue that these two moments of a critical theory of ideology are both present in Horkheimer’s early work. As one of the primary pitfalls of the sociology of knowledge is its methodology, subsection 3.3 covers methodological matters, arguing that the proper means to analyze ideology in capitalist social relations requires the adoption of a dialectical method. After the methodological background, subsection 3.4 deals with ideology <em>theory</em>, arguing that Horkheimer’s conception of ideology views it as playing a specific <em>functional</em> role in class relations. Subsection 3.5 deals with the other half of the formula: the <em>critical</em> moment of the critical theory of ideology. Throughout this analysis, one sees the contraposition of ideology as falsehood to the concept of <em>totality</em>. Consequently, subsection 3.6 provides some further contextualization of totality as a concept. As the reader may wish for a concrete example of the critical theory of ideology, I end section 3 by recapitulating Horkheimer’s analysis of the bourgeois revolutionary and applying it to Tommaso Campanella. The essay then concludes by flagging some further areas for research.</p> <h2 id="horkheimers-critique-of-mannheim">Horkheimer’s Critique of Mannheim</h2> <p>Horkheimer begins his critique of Mannheim with a methodological point. Mannheim treats Marxist thought as part of his “sociology of knowledge” which explains a social totality. Yet the <em>true</em> purpose of Marxist thought is to change the world, not to explain it.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "A New Concept of Ideology"? from *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, trans. G. Frederick Hunter, Matthew S. Kramer, and John Torpey (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1993), 129.</d-footnote> While Horkheimer sees some value in Mannheim’s work, he does not think it beyond reproach. Mannheim sees the purpose of the sociology of knowledge as not a partisan tool but as a “sociological history of thought.” This intellectual field seems impossible to water, as even the sociologist’s worldview is situationally determined. Hence, the prospect of impartiality in the sociology of knowledge is grim. The sociology of knowledge aims to provide us a way out of the academic crisis of the era, in which “faith in the unconditional validity of the various world views [sic] has been fundamentally shaken.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 130.</d-footnote></p> <p>Mannheim distinguishes between <em>particular</em> and <em>total</em> ideologies. The former consists in ascribing the origin of a <em>specific</em> belief to bias or interest. By contrast, the latter casts doubt on an entire opposing <em>Weltanschauung</em>. Much like Kant’s claim that the judgments of experience are the result of our application of the categories, Mannheim argues that our worldviews are the result of categories that are the result of our given situational determination. We thus do not think universally; our social group conditions our thought. Thus, not only <em>what</em> we know is subject to situational determination, but <em>how</em> we think. Hence, the charge of false consciousness has become universalized. Though he invokes false consciousness, Mannheim wants a generalized version of ideology that is not restricted to Marxism.<d-footnote>Ibid., 131.</d-footnote> While Mannheim claims that the total conception of ideology has its <em>origins</em> in Marxist thought, accusations of total ideology are somewhat novel.<d-footnote>Ibid., 130.</d-footnote> To prevent lapsing into philosophical relativism, Mannheim distinguishes between his thesis of situational determination and relativism. The former merely entails that all thought is ultimately rooted in “a definite social situation.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This <em>sociological</em> claim does not require the sociologist of knowledge to take sides and give a moral <em>evaluation</em> of an ideological dispute. The sociologist of knowledge is not an ethicist. They do not judge the moral soundness of a worldview, but only describe it. In effect, Mannheim’s system is the <em>inverse</em> of the meta-ethical expressivism that would become popular a few years later in the Anglosphere.<d-footnote>See A.J. Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic* (London, Penguin Books: 1971).</d-footnote> For both the expressivist and the sociologist of knowledge, there is a strict fact-value distinction. Hence, there is also a strict separation between the act of describing a claim and judging its moral status.<d-footnote>Though perhaps in different ways, since the expressivism in vogue at the time held fast to a positivism wherein every truth was either analytic a priori or a posteriori, empirical, and contingent. Hence Mannheim's Kantian leanings might rub at odds with the Anglophone dismissal of the synthetic a priori.</d-footnote> For the expressivist, moral claims do not <em>describe</em> any mind-independent facts about ethics. Moral language only expresses the speaker’s approval or disapproval of the act in question, or aims to arouse similar sentiments in others.<d-footnote>Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic*, 110-1.</d-footnote> The sociologist of knowledge <em>describes</em> the sociological fact that people’s ideas spring forth from their situational determination without commending or condemning. Just as the expressivist is not in the business of describing the world, the sociologist of knowledge is not in the business of judging it.</p> <p>Despite this point of agreement with expressivists, Mannheim is no positivist. His approach diverges from positivism due to his insistence on the <em>historical</em> element of truth. While positivism held fast to the adage that “facts are stubborn things,” Mannheim insisted that there was no ahistorical unified truth that could survive unblemished. Rather, the validity of a system of thought depends on its historical moment.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 132.</d-footnote> Ideologies have a temporal validity. What was once a valid system of thought may lose its validity. By contrast, some ideologies are <em>utopian</em> because their appearance is too hasty. Utopian ideologies are invalid <em>now</em> but gain validity <em>later</em>.<d-footnote>The obvious example here (though Horkheimer does not give it explicitly) is the utopian socialism of Thomas Müntzer, the Conspiracy of Equals, Fourier, Saint-Simon, and Robert Owen, all of whom saw the utopian element of socialism but whose appearance *pre festum* meant that the categories of thought had were ill-suited to a historical situation with insufficiently developed productive forces.</d-footnote> Thus, the sociologist of knowledge determines the truth or falsity of an ideology in relation to a definite historical period. Hence, false consciousness is theoretically and normatively antiquated consciousness. It is a consciousness whose retrograde elements <em>obscure</em> rather than <em>clarify</em>. The historical moment is the yardstick by which one measures the truth of an ideology. Thus, contra the logical empiricists, truths are not independent, ahistorical entities, but <em>dynamic</em>.</p> <p>To return to 1930, Mannheim diagnoses methodological pluralism as the cause of the crisis in thought.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 133.</d-footnote> Each thought system can grasp bits of the truth and reconcile it to its methodological best practices. But differences in individual social standpoints entail that there is a seeming lack of organic unity in the present. At present, there are several ideologies that are at least in part irreconcilable. These stem from different ways of looking at the world that are situationally determined. The sociology of knowledge seeks to overcome intellectual fragmentation by attempting to stand outside ideologies. In so doing, it aims to show ideologies to be the result of definite historical processes, with the aim of freeing people from their historical determinations.<d-footnote>Ibid., 134.</d-footnote></p> <p>The trouble is that Mannheim misuses Marx. Marx “wanted to transform philosophy into positive science and praxis.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim eschews this task and returns to metaphysics. Mannheim wants to use the sociology of knowledge to reach a higher truth that stands outside the constraints of ideology. Yet he also claims that the truth we reach is not “valid for all times and for all human beings.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim is far from the only person whose denial of a generally valid philosophical system leads to problems.<d-footnote>Per Horkheimer, this is also a problem for Dilthey, who thought we could understand human nature in retrospect. Dilthey's appeal to some Ur-principles makes sense given the rest of his philosophical commitments, but this is not a route available to Mannheim.</d-footnote> Still, his conflation of the development of humanity inside ideologies and historical progress outside the realm of ideology renders ideological entities metaphysically strange.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept,", 135.</d-footnote> Mannheim’s theory cannot appeal to an atemporal human essence given his commitment to the claim that our beliefs are situationally determined. Despite this, he still appeals to an abstract, atemporal human essence. Mannheim wants to <em>both</em> have the plurality of ideologies point to a situational determination of total ideologies which cast doubt on a unifying human essence, and at the same time appeal to some transhistorical humanity, “the essence of which all existing persons carry within themselves.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim makes the same mistake that classical idealist philosophy made. That is, he posits humanity as a metaphysical entity that is unlike any other and does not correspond to the lives of flesh and blood people. But the argument for giving human essence a prime position in the theory is weak. Abstract humanity is an entity which stands outside the behaviors and motivations of sensuous human activity. It thus cannot explain real human behavior and thought. In effect, Horkheimer shows that Mannheim’s appeal to human essence falls prey to a Mackie-esque Argument from Queerness.<d-footnote>See J. L. Mackie, *Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong* (Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1977), 38-42.</d-footnote> If there <em>were</em> a human essence, it would be an entity “of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in”<d-footnote>Ibid., 38.</d-footnote> Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge. The concept of a general total conception of ideology militates <em>against</em> some transhistorical essence which escapes situational determination. Thus, the entire edifice of Mannheim’s theory rests on a foundational essence which the theory states cannot exist.</p> <p>A similar problem befalls Mannheim’s conception of history. This theory does not point to determinate historical entities but appeals to a “realm beyond history.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 137.</d-footnote> Once again, Mannheim confuses the concept of humanity as such for flesh and blood people. The <em>real</em> struggles which claim the lives of millions in their conflagrations "are not the ‘real’ things toward which our investigations are directed."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Rather, what counts is the conceptual apparatus which changes according to one’s situational determination. Reality <em>as such</em> holds no importance beyond the conceptual apparatus through which one views it. But does this not <em>also</em> apply to the concept of a transhistorical human essence? Once one forgoes the appeal to transcendent humanity, then one is only left with the claim that standpoints are an important part of an overall historical process. Manheim even imbues this belief with a mystical flair which gains a secularized coat of paint via an appeal to historical processes. Again, Horkheimer criticizes Mannheim for his inconsistency. The latter eschews the idea of an eternally valid viewpoint, but qualifies this by claiming that “the ontological decisions according to which we experience and analyze facts increasingly reveals an overarching meaning.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 137-8.</d-footnote> But his appeals to humanity are themselves ideological at base. Mannheim’s appeals to “essence” and “humanity” depend on a conceptual apparatus that his sociological framework casts doubt upon. Even if there <em>were</em> such abstracta, Mannheim’s system gives us a reason to believe that we would be categorically unable to know them. Much like Mackie’s critique of ethics, <em>if</em> some transcendent meaning of history existed, our knowledge of it could only occur through “some special faculty of […] perception or intuition, utterly different from our ordinary ways of knowing everything else.”<d-footnote>Mackie, *Ethics*, 38.</d-footnote> Appealing to metaphysical systems which posit such entities as a given is not a solution. These systems are ones which Mannheim’s system gives us reason to doubt.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 138.</d-footnote></p> <p>Despite his Kantian pretensions, Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge requires dogmatism to buttress it. This is not a problem for the revolutionary critique of ideology, as it tries to do away with metaphysical superstitions. By contrast, Mannheim seeks to ossify them. Marx was correct to cast doubt on abstract humanity as a substitute for flesh and blood men. Hence, Mannheim views the human essence as the subject of history, but for Marx it is the concrete human being “in a definite historical moment.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 139.</d-footnote> To insist on the former is to think ideologically and dismiss “the real sufferings of economically underprivileged classes.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> History, then, “cannot possibly be the expression of some meaningful whole,”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> but is the result of contradictions between men. Materialism has no predefined schema; it cannot stipulate some <em>telos</em> of history. To do so would let it lapse back into the very vagaries it attempts to avoid. Mannheim appeals to abstract entities like a human essence to avoid the charge of relativism. Yet the charge of relativism itself is based on a static ontology which is suspect.<d-footnote>Ibid., 140.</d-footnote> There is no transcendent principle of truth to which to appeal. Hence, Mannheim’s own relativization of all conceptions is itself relative. Horkheimer notes that since “all our ideas […] depend upon conditions that may change, […] the notion of an eternal truth which outlives all perceiving subjects is untenable.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This does not entail scientific skepticism. While the content of the claims that science makes (e.g., about nature) extend beyond the lifetime of humanity, the claims themselves “express something about the relationship of humanity and nature […] but nothing about the relation of truth and being in general.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim, by contrast, judges the charge of relativism by the yardstick of eternal truth. Despite this, his system casts doubt on eternal truth <em>tout court</em>.</p> <p>For Mannheim, particular ideology is particular because the conditional nature of the determining social situation bars the bearer of any particular ideology from making claims to absolute truth. But the claim of situational determination is incoherent, since it presumes that it itself is not situationally determined; it thereby treats standpoints under the aspect of eternity.<d-footnote>Ibid., 141.</d-footnote> Similarly, Mannheim intended situational determination to avoid the charge of relativism by focusing on the pragmatic upshot of beliefs. But this confuses the true and false with genuine and spurious. Mannheim treats the concept of ideology as one which has intensified and radicalized over time. It blossoms from a particular ideology to a total conception of ideology. From there, the specialized total conception of ideology allows for a general total conception of ideology. This general total conception of ideology creates the possibility of a sociology of knowledge. This sketch includes the claim that ideology has become so totalized that one may treat it with systematic rigor. Yet Horkheimer claims that this unrelenting focus on the general does not do justice to the particular.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> To trace the implications of ideology, as Mannheim does, does not necessarily make it a good theoretical tool. Many scientific theories have failed to prove useful after deep inquiry. There is no guarantee that Mannheim’s theory of ideology would prove different.</p> <p>Moreover, Mannheim depoliticized ideology, especially in the move between particular and total conceptions of ideology. In so doing, he worsens the analysis by failing to account for the link between the political and economic distribution of power and the social concepts in play.<d-footnote>Ibid., 142.</d-footnote> When moving to the total conception of ideology, one must now subject an entire <em>Weltanschauung</em> to ideological critique. In so doing, Mannheim stresses the need to treat nearly everything as ideological. This universalization transforms the concept from a definite accusation to dogmatic metaphysics. This itself is a manifestation of false consciousness. It replaces interests or empirical facts with a vulgar reflection theory as the explanans. Mannheim must also reject modern psychology, which explains the development of men’s ideas in terms of their external needs. For Mannheim, the development of ideas does not depend on real people’s lives, but from their social strata.<d-footnote>Ibid., 143.</d-footnote> This “correspondence of form”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> occurs not only at the level of economic class (as is the case in Vulgar Marxism), but also implies a distinct set of aesthetic, metaphysical, and moral categories in the members of the stratum. Mannheim’s theory relies on ideal types of people, to whom correspond beliefs and worldviews. In doing so, one can afterward “reconstruct” the social situation in which the ideology emerges. This reconstruction should avoid value judgments. This process prevents one from viewing the social situation as a totality, as it reduces it to a mere amalgamation of different viewpoints. Moreover, such a total conception of ideology proves to be as much of an “idealistic overextension”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> as the concept of a human essence. The total concept of ideology depends on the notion of a totality of consciousness, a totality “in the sense of a superficial concept of the whole.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> While such a totality has merit in biology and psychology, it cannot be the case in ideology. This is because people’s consciousness is bound up with the social and environmental surroundings. That is, it is intertwined with definite material social relations.<d-footnote>Ibid., 144.</d-footnote> This does not entail a strict mind-to-world parallelism. The development of a person does not always mirror the development of their society. <em>Weltanschauungen</em> do not develop apart from the socioeconomic conditions in which they appear. To pretend that they are freestanding intellectual constructs is idealist nonsense. Mannheim eschews the non-autonomy of thought from material conditions in favor of a psychological framework which emerges in a sociohistorical reality. In so doing, he merely reinvents the Hegelian <em>Volksgeist</em> with different verbiage. By ignoring the role of power and struggle, Mannheim treats the relationship between an individual and his ideology as if it were deterministic rather than as the result of everyday struggle.<d-footnote>Ibid., 145.</d-footnote> Thus, for Mannheim, the struggle between ideologies stands apart and above the struggle between definite individuals. At one plane of struggle is the struggle of determinate individuals, on another is a struggle between ideologies. The relationship between these two planes is unclear at best.</p> <p>By a <em>general</em> total concept of ideology, Mannheim means that intellectuals understand that situational determination limits <em>every</em> ideology, including one’s own. As such, no ideology can reach eternally valid truth. This renders every pattern of thought ideological. Since Mannheim strips ideology of its accusatory nature, he renders it meaningless. Now, the term merely signifies that a claim lacks access to a mind-independent truth. All ideologies are born in the original sin of situational determination. To be consistent, one must give an account of the categories that one is using, including what “being” and <em>Weltanschauungen</em> are. In contrast to the general total concept of ideology is the <em>special</em> conception of the total concept of ideology. In the special conception, one merely puts into question <em>competing</em> ideologies. The special conception shows promise in giving an account of the relevant categories.<d-footnote>Ibid., 146.</d-footnote> This is most prominent with Mannheim’s ambiguous relationship to Marxism. When talking about the special conception, Mannheim uses Marxism as the ideology with which to criticize all others. On the other hand, Mannheim treats Marxism as one ideology among many which is subject to the critiques of the general conception of total ideology. Thus, Mannheim critiques Marxism but appeals to certain categories of class society uncritically. But without <em>some</em> categories of thought, situational determination loses its meaning, as there are no sociological structures which determine individuals’ ideological beliefs. Without an account of society, Mannheim’s account of situational determination falls apart because it is underdefined. Thus, each ideology may use its own categories when defining situational determination. Marxists can interpret it along lines of social classes and relations of production while idealists may interpret it according to <em>Volksgeister</em>, and so on. Mannheim’s invocation of a social situation is too vague. Horkheimer approvingly cites Troeltsch, who claims that “society” is an ambiguous term and overly abstract unless anchored in economic relations. As it stands, though, the sociology of knowledge lacks the categories which can carve society into the ideal types to which ideologies are situationally determined. This renders it meaningless.</p> <p>A similar problem applies to Mannheim’s notion of ideological appropriateness. Mannheim also must resort to a spiritual examination of the criteria of ideological appropriateness. He grounds the appropriateness of an ideology to its “correctness” to its time (i.e., not obsolete or utopian). But this correctness is itself not based on “an explicit, scientific theory of society.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Thus, correctness becomes arbitrary, epoch-based, and circular. Consider Mannheim’s example of an obsolete ideology: that of a landed proprietor who still views his <em>de facto</em> capitalist estate through the lens of feudal social relations. If viewing the estate in this way is obsolete, it is so thanks to some <em>non-ideological</em> metric. Basing “one’s commitment to this theory on the grounds of its appropriateness to the epoch, which is precisely the basis upon which the theory is to be judged, would be circular.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 148.</d-footnote> Mannheim restricts the analysis of ideology to the cognitive realm. This makes the landowner’s failure a mere epistemic matter. In doing so, he ignores the <em>social</em> function of ideology: i.e., how ideology shapes reality. As a result, Mannheim’s analysis of ideology is one-sided and overly abstract. It analyzes social life as it stands but otherwise leaves social life unexamined. Even when analyzing a specific <em>Weltanschauung</em>, Mannheim does not connect the ideology to its social effects or the relations that bearers of that thought have to the world around them.<d-footnote>Ibid., 149</d-footnote> Despite its sociological façade, Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge contents itself with reintroducing a pseudo-Hegelian philosophy of <em>Geist</em> that Marx superseded. Hence, Horkheimer concludes that “Mannheim distinguishes himself from those irresponsible philosophers whose blindness he claims is caused by their persistence in a "higher realm" (104) only in that he returns there himself with a few weapons from the arsenal of Marxism.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="a-critical-theory-of-ideology">A Critical Theory of Ideology</h2> <h3 id="a-negative-example">A Negative Example</h3> <p>At first glance, Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge provides us with an excellent <em>negative</em> example: that is, an example which shows us what to <em>avoid</em>. There are 3 interrelated problems with the model that one would be wise to avoid. First, Mannheim’s model posits strange metaphysical entities which should not exist by the model’s own suppositions. These entities include the appeal to a transcendental, ahistorical humanity. The theory of situational determination cannot explain the existence of such entities. The ideal type which corresponds to an ideology is another example. It putatively stands in for groups of flesh and blood people. Yet this entity stands over and above the conceptual schema that said flesh and blood people use in everyday life.</p> <p>This is due to a second pitfall with the model, Mannheim’s attempt to give a value-free analysis of ideology <em>causes</em> him to rely on such metaphysical entities. The net result of this is that, despite its scientific pretensions, the sociology of knowledge <em>loses</em> explanatory power when compared to a less metaphysically cumbersome theory. This is most notable with the pseudo-normative concept of utopia. A utopian ideology is a state of mind which “is incongruous with the state of reality within which it occurs.”<d-footnote>Karl Mannheim, *Ideology and Utopia: An Introduction to the Sociology of Knowledge* (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979), 173. Annoyingly, despite Louis Wirth being involved in both this translation and the translation used in the Horkheimer translation, the pagination is different.</d-footnote> Describing an ideology as utopian runs into one of two problems. Either it is circular, as appropriateness to the era is the “basis upon which the theory [of utopia] is to be judged,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 148.</d-footnote> or it posits a temporal appropriateness as some entity which stands <em>outside</em> situational determination. If the latter is the case, then the theory of utopia must rely on a concept of ‘ ”nonideological” correctness:’<d-footnote>Ibid., 147.</d-footnote> an entity which the theory says cannot exist, as such an entity would have to stand <em>outside</em> situational determination.</p> <p>The concept of utopianism falls prey to a third problem with the theory. That the quasi-normative description of utopianism does not solve the previous problem because Mannheim adds the normative concepts <em>post hoc</em>. Hence, the concept has no grounding in the theory itself. The extent to which utopianism <em>is</em> a normative concept is unclear. By reducing ideology to a cognitive framework, Mannheim reduces utopianism to a mere epistemic fault.</p> <p>What would a critical theory of ideology that avoids these pitfalls look like? Remarkably like that of the early Frankfurt School. Thus, what follows is a sketch of the critical theory of ideology as present in the <em>Institut für Sozialforschung</em> during its heyday in the 1930s, a sketch which avoids the pitfalls of the sociology of knowledge.</p> <h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3> <p>At this juncture, one must distinguish between two interwoven but nonetheless distinguishable tasks that any critical theory of ideology must provide. On the one hand, it must provide an <em>Ideologietheorie</em>: a theory of how ideologies function and the role they play in larger social structures. On the other hand, it must provide an <em>Ideologiekritik</em>: it must show that the ideologies in question obscure or render unintelligible some facts of social life. The received wisdom regarding the Frankfurt School is that it had the latter but lacked the former. This received wisdom is false, as it ignores the way in which both concepts are intertwined for the first generation of Critical Theorists. In what follows, I show that the Frankfurt School’s development of an <em>Ideologietheorie</em> is rather quite prominent, so long as one knows where to look. In particular, the Frankfurt School’s functionalism places ideology within the context of capitalist social relations. Afterward, I show that the Frankfurt School’s <em>adjectival</em> conception of ideology provides the critical half of the equation, giving ideology an <em>obfuscatory</em> role regarding immanent contradictions in social relations.</p> <p>A few words on what constitutes a critical theory of ideology are in order. The <em>critical</em> element is not vacuously filled by any subjection of assumptions to scrutiny. Indeed, this element is ostensibly part of the most vulgar bourgeois critiques of ideology that emerged during the early modern period, i.e., the ascendent era of capitalism in Europe. However, the articulation of ideology critique in capitalist society both then and now is class-based, as Horkheimer notes that “the criticism of the system [of relations that reproduce capitalist social life] is to be the prerogative of those who have an interest in it.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Concerning Resentment" from *Dawn &amp; Decline* (New York: The Seabury Press, 1978), 31.</d-footnote> Criticism in the bourgeois sense is counterposed to <em>resentment</em>, which is reserved to those “who have the opportunity to know [capitalism’s] underside.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Bourgeois thought in its skeptical form is welcoming toward criticism, so long as “critical tendencies [are] voiced only toward fantasies—so-called ideologies—and not at all toward things as they are.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Montaigne and the Function of Skepticism" from *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 296.</d-footnote> This renders criticism impotent as it considers theory as “relative and separate from praxis.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This impotence stems from a misconception about the relationship between ideology and materialism: “the foundation of authoritarian domination lies not in the delusions with which it rationalizes itself, but in the social structure of production that rules the age and shapes of the character of human beings according to their place within it.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Hence, for the Frankfurt School, <em>Ideologiekritik</em>, and by extension the critical theory of ideology, is not a mere intellectual exercise, but a task that exposes the immanent contradictions of bourgeois thought for its supersession.</p> <p>But in raising this point about the nature of criticism, I have inevitably stumbled across the question of <em>methodology</em>. After all, if the mere academic exercise of exposing illusions does not suffice for a critical theory of ideology, what other steps are necessary? As we have seen, Mannheim’s conception of social determination is too abstract and imprecise to function as a starting point. To that end, the following section explains the methodological principles which the Frankfurt School uses in its quest.</p> <h3 id="non-autonomy-of-thought-from-activity">Non-Autonomy of Thought from Activity</h3> <p>Recall that one problem with Mannheim’s conception of ideology is that it is too vague and therefore allows the reader to insert their preferred theory of ideology into the account. To avoid this pitfall, one must use a different method than Mannheim’s, lest it fall prey to the very same indeterminate metaphysical entities one should do away with. Hence, as a matter of method, one must stress the <em>non-autonomy of thought</em> from activity. The oft-quoted Marxist claim that “legal relations as well as the forms of state [...] have their roots in the material conditions of life”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, "Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1978), 4.</d-footnote> extends to the origin of ideology as well. This does not imply that such material relations are <em>a priori</em> concrete and immediately accessible to the investigator. Such material conditions are only uncovered <em>after</em> engaging in dialectical investigation. To fail to conduct such an investigation leaves the putative material relations overly abstract and insufficiently determinate. Marx’s methodological criticism of the classical political economy is relevant:</p> <blockquote> <p>“It seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete, with the real precondition, thus to begin, in economics, with e.g. the population, which is the foundation and the subject of the entire social act of production. However, on closer examination this proves false. The population is an abstraction if I leave out, for example, the classes of which it is composed. These classes in turn are an empty phrase if I am not familiar with the elements on which they rest. E.g. wage labour, capital, etc. These latter in turn presuppose exchange, division of labour, prices, etc. For example, capital is nothing without wage labour, without value, money, price etc. Thus, if I were to begin with the population, this would be a chaotic conception [<em>Vorstellung</em>] of the whole, and I would then, by means of further determination, move analytically towards ever more simple concepts [<em>Begriff</em>], from the imagined concrete towards ever thinner abstractions until I had arrived at the simplest determinations. From there the journey would have to be retraced until I had finally arrived at the population again, but this time not as the chaotic conception of a whole, but as a rich totality of many determinations and relations.”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Grundrisse* (London: Penguin Classics, 1993), 100.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Moving from the concrete to the abstract uncovers the abstract relations which govern the (previously empty, formalistic) concreta, but these abstract relations in turn can only attain validity <em>on the basis of an investigation of definite material social relations</em>. Consequently:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence unity of the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking, therefore, as a process of concentration, as a result, not as a point of departure, even though it is the point of departure in reality and hence also the point of departure for observation <em>Anschauung</em> and conception.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 101.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Within the abstracta that one uncovers via this process is the seed of the social relations which give it its validity. For instance, “the simplest economic category, say e.g. exchange value, presupposes population, moreover a population producing in specific relations; as well as a certain kind of family, or commune, or state, etc. It can never exist other than as an abstract, one-sided relation within an already given, concrete, living whole.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>One therefore returns to the concrete, but this time as a set of concrete relations which are the <em>result</em> of dialectical investigation and not dogmatically assumed. These concrete facts are <em>social</em> in nature, as the asocial conception of a human essence is one which treats sensuous activity as if it were mere contemplation.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: Norton &amp; Co., Inc., 1978), 145, §VI.</d-footnote></p> <p>Another advantage of Marx’s dialectical method is that it not only avoids the problems of the overly abstract and indeterminate methodology of Mannheim, but also the overly specific and asocial methodology which ostensibly lies in contraposition to it. Bukharin notes that nearly every economic figure associated with the Marginal Revolution argues for the subjective theory of value using examples of isolated atomic individuals and then presuming that such examples scale up to a social level.<d-footnote>Nikolai Bukharin, *Economic Theory of the Leisure Class* (New York: International Publisher, 1927), 42.</d-footnote> This Hobbesian model, on which the functioning of the whole is wholly reducible to the functioning of the constituent parts is unjustified because man is a <em>zoon politikon</em> and not Robinson Crusoe, and consequently a society is more than a mere aggregation of Robinson Crusoes. The economic effects of the inherent sociality of humanity are that the picture of society that positivists like the Marginal Economists depict is not only incorrect, but <em>precisely</em> <em>backward</em>, as Bukharin argues:</p> <blockquote> <p>Society (as is consciously or unconsciously assumed) is not an arithmetical aggregate of isolated individuals; on the contrary, <em>the economic activity of each specific individual pre-supposes a definite social environment in which the social relation of the individual economies finds its expression</em> [emphasis mine]. The motives of the individual living in isolation are entirely different from those of the “social animal” (<em>zoon politikon</em>). The former lives in an environment consisting of nature, of things in their pristine simplicity; the latter is surrounded not only by “matter” but also by a peculiar social milieu. The transition from the isolated human to society is possible only by way of the social milieu. And indeed, if we were dealing only with an aggregate of individual economies, without any points of contact between them, […] there would be no society. Of course, it is theoretically quite possible to embrace a number of isolated and remote economies in a single conception, to force them into a “totality” as it were. <em>But this totality or aggregate would not be a society</em> [emphasis mine], a system of economies closely connected with each other with constant interaction between them. While the former aggregate would be one we had artificially constructed, the second is one that is truly present. Therefore the individual economic subject may be regarded only as a member of a social economic system, not as an isolated atom.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Individualistic models of social science à la Hobbes and Böhm-Bawerk therefore create a false totality that does injustice to <em>both</em> the particular <em>and</em> the general. But the excursus on the Marginal Revolution shows us a second problem with extant attempts to unite social sciences under the banner of philosophy: namely, that different social sciences embrace mutually exclusive philosophical assumptions and methodologies.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 8.</d-footnote> That the assumptions and methodologies are useful within a specific field does not take away from the fact that these assumptions seem impossible to reconcile into a totality. For example, while mainstream economics embraces an individualistic methodology that privileges the particular individual over social processes as a whole, the opposite problem occurs in some branches of sociology which rely on ideal types of groups of individuals that do not cleanly correspond to flesh and blood individuals.<d-footnote>Recall that this is one problem with Mannheim's sociology of knowledge.</d-footnote> For instance, one finds in Émile Durkheim’s seminal work on suicide a methodology that proceeds <em>from</em> the general <em>to</em> the particular: a methodology totally repugnant to the individualistic methodology of economics. Differences in the types of suicides are fleshed out in terms of their causes, i.e., the “social conditions responsible for them.”<d-footnote>Émile Durkheim, *Suicide*, trans. John A. Spaulding and George Simpson (London: Routledge Classics, 2002), 99.</d-footnote> Specific instances of suicide correspond with more or less fidelity <em>to</em> the ideal types, since the object of analysis is the “<em>social</em> suicide-rate [emphasis mine].”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Thus, contra the method of economics<d-footnote>As well as the tendency toward isolated thought experiments in analytic philosophy, though such a method only blossomed well after the period of time under consideration in this essay.</d-footnote> “[t]he social rate must be taken directly as the object of analysis; progress must be from the whole to the parts.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 100.</d-footnote></p> <p>A methodology like that of Marx, one which searches for the material social relations which lie immanent in the abstracta of a given ideology, is necessary for a critical theory of ideology. By investigating the dialectic between ideology and material relations, we also solve the problem of the disconnect between ideology as such and its bearers in Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge, that is, a gap between “the mundane struggles of everyday historical life, and <em>next to them also</em> the conflicts of the ‘systems of <em>Weltanschauungen</em>.’ ”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept of Ideology?," 145.</d-footnote> Without the dialectical critique of ideology in material social relations, the whole concept of situational determination becomes metaphysically strange and lacking in any explanatory power.</p> <p>Moreover, while Mannheim’s attempt to give a value-free conception of ideology has a scientific veneer, his eschewing of the normative side of ideology requires a strict fact/value distinction which itself is unscientific. This division is a common problem to scientific inquiry of the time, especially of positivism. As Horkheimer notes in “Notes on Science and the Crisis,” scientific inquiry does not stand outside the “dynamisms of history,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis," in Critical Theory: Selected Essays, trans. Matthew J. O'Connell and others (New York: Continuum Publishing Co., 2002), 3.</d-footnote> and thus the cleavage between “theory and action is itself a historical process.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 4.</d-footnote> Scientific inquiry, including the Mannheimian sociology of knowledge, is in the grasp of two contradictions:</p> <blockquote> <p>“First, science accepts as a principle that its every step has a critical basis, yet […] the setting of tasks, lacks a theoretical grounding and seems to be taken arbitrarily. Second, science has to do with a knowledge of comprehensive relationships; yet, it has no realistic grasp of that comprehensive relationship upon which its own existence and the direction of its work depend, namely, society.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 7.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Underlying both these problems is the need for science to be directed by “the necessities of social life,”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> viz., the necessities of <em>capitalist</em> social life, which takes as a presupposition the division of labor. Returning to Mannheim, we see that the insistence that the sociology of knowledge stands <em>above</em> specific total conceptions of ideology imbues it with a false totality insofar as it does not ground the predominance of these ideologies in social relations. On this point, it is unsurprising that there is a degree of affinity between Mannheim and the Neo-Kantians of the Marburg School, both of whom insist that “everything about the object is reduced to conceptual determinations, [and hence] the end-result of such theoretical work is that nothing is to be regarded as material and stable.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Traditional and Critical Theory" from *Critical Theory: Selected Essays,* trans. Matthew J. O'Connell and others (New York: Continuum Publishing Co., 2002), 198.</d-footnote> We have, then, a totality, but a false and empty one.</p> <p>One material relation that undergirds this intellectual fragmentation is the division of labor in capitalist societies. Here, Lukacs’ work on reified consciousness presaged later critiques of scientific inquiry by the Frankfurt School. The mere fact that there are psychological implications of commodity fetishism is obvious. After all, it involves misperceiving the social relations of labor as “an objective character stamped upon the product of that labor”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Capital* (Hertfordshire: Wordsworth Editions Limited, 2013), 47.</d-footnote> while the objects <em>themselves</em> appear in the social relations of the value-form. The results of such a process is that objectivity and subjectivity get inverted; the world of commodities, as Lukacs notes, “confront [man] as invisible forces that generate their own power”<d-footnote>Georg Lukacs, *History and Class Consciousness*, trans. Rodney Livingstone (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1971), 87.</d-footnote> while <em>subjectively</em> “a man’s activity becomes estranged from himself, it turns into a commodity which […] must go its own way independently of man just like any consumer article.”<d-footnote>Ibid. Also note that *HCC* was published *before* the publication of the 1844 Manuscripts!</d-footnote> <em>Pace</em> concerns about conflating the Taylorist and Fordist mode of capitalist production of the early 20^th^ century with contemporary, putatively “post-Fordist” production, one may still identify the throughline of rationalization and specialization: viz., the breaking down of the productive process “into abstract, rational, [specialized] operations so that the worker loses contact with the finished product and his work is reduced to the mechanical repetition of a [specialized] set of actions.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 88.</d-footnote> This implies a second process: that of converting labor time “from a merely empirical average figure to an objectively calculable work-stint that confronts the worker as a fixed and established reality.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> The psychological consequence of this process is that even the worker’s “psychological attributes are separated from his total personality and placed in opposition to it so as to facilitate their integration into specialised [sic] rational systems and their reduction to statistically viable concepts.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>Why assume intellectual labor is any different? The mere fact that there <em>is</em> an intellectual division of labor is mundane, but leads to profound consequences. The intellectual division of labor leads to an isolation of specialized fields from one another, which in turn limit their utility and scholarly output. Buck-passing on matters of fact leads some disciplines (especially in the social sciences) to uncritically accept the object of their investigation, weakening the overall scientific value of the endeavor. But this uncritical acceptance <em>also</em> distorts the goals of scientific inquiry. For Horkheimer,</p> <blockquote> <p>“A conception [of theory] is needed which overcomes the one-sidedness that necessarily arises when limited intellectual processes are detached from their matrix in the total activity of society. In the idea of theory which the scholar inevitably reaches when working purely within his own discipline, the relation between fact and conceptual ordering of fact offers a point of departure for such a corrective conception. The prevailing theory of knowledge has, of course, recognized the problem which this relation raises. The point is constantly stressed that identical objects provide for one discipline problems to be resolved only in some distant future, while in another discipline they are accepted as simple facts.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Traditional and Critical Theory," 199.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Hence, what makes something ideological is not <em>just</em> a question of the researcher uncritically accepting the object of analysis (thought that is <em>part</em> of the formulation). Rather, ideology <em>also</em> required that the aims of investigation also determined by entities other than the researchers themselves. The researcher is not a Kantian agent who can set their own hypothetical ends, but rather a part of a capitalist process who must subordinate these ends. This subordination may be <em>immediate</em>, in the case where one subordinates the ends of research to one’s boss or research and development board, or <em>mediately</em> via attempts to reify one’s consciousness (as occurs when one chases academic trends rather than pursue one’s self-selected goals).Both the input <em>and</em> the output of intellectual research are determined in scientific inquiry. Social totality determines <em>both</em> the object of analysis and the researcher as subject, both of which determine the aims. Social totality <em>needs</em> to be taken into account. I shall henceforth refer to the two ways in which social totality determines intellectual activity (that is, it both determines the object of analysis, which the researcher must uncritically accept, and the <em>telos</em> toward which the activity aims) as <em>double determination</em>.</p> <p>One of two consequences follow from this intellectual division of labor. Either scholars must content themselves with the role that the division of labor provides for them, in which case many questions worth investigating are left unanswered,<d-footnote>See, *inter alia*, Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc., 2014), 6.53, p. 107-8.</d-footnote> or one must engage in blind speculation beyond the limits of one’s discipline. Consequently, we see in both “Traditional and Critical Theory” as well as “Notes on Science and the Crisis” that the intellectual division of labor is the ultimately determining grounds for limitations in thought. To return to Mannheim, then, we see another error in the sociology of knowledge: viz., that it proceeds <em>from</em> the particular <em>to</em> the total conception of ideology. While, for Mannheim, the total conception of ideology flows <em>from</em> the development of the particular concept of ideology, Lukacs shows us that the individual <em>psychological</em> characteristics which constitute a particular conception of ideology are the <em>result</em> of, in the final analysis, the capitalist division of labor, while Horkheimer shows that this analysis <em>also</em> applies to reified academic pursuits. This leads, in turn, for social scientists to fall prey to double determination, and requires the imposition of strange metaphysical entities to do the explanatory work. We now have a basic methodological schematic for investigating ideology. What remains is to uncover <em>how</em> things are determined via ideology.</p> <h3 id="functionalism">Functionalism</h3> <p>The <em>Ideologietheorie</em> of the Frankfurt School finds its most fleshed out form when investigating the self-conception of the so-called “early modern” thinkers who represented the nascent bourgeoisie contra decadent feudalism. This is because thinkers like Machiavelli and Hobbes were the first to broach the subject of ideology, that is, the question of “how the social situation relates to the prevailing ideas that come to be recognized as false.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History" in *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 361.</d-footnote> Yet the approach that especially the latter undertook rendered such an investigation fruitless for two reasons, per Horkheimer. First, for liberal theorists, the term “ideology” merely refers to the inverse of Reason.<d-footnote>Ibid., 361.</d-footnote> This juxtaposition is itself historical, as “the material and intellectual development of the preceding periods as a necessary prerequisite for the Enlightenment.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Were Enlightenment able to self-reflect on its own temporal ascendence, the rigidity of the distinction would vanish. This is a point that even the mature Horkheimer and Adorno stress in <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>; viz., that despite Enlightenment’s pretense of liberating humanity from the “self-incurred immaturity”<d-footnote>Immanuel Kant, \"An Answer to the Question: What Is Enlightenment?\" in *Toward a Perpetual Peace and Other Writings on Politics, Peace, and History*, (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2006), 17, 8:35.</d-footnote> of myth, it was incapable of grasping that Enlightenment “entangles itself […] in mythology.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, *Dialectic of Enlightenment,* trans. Edmund Jephcott (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2002), 8.</d-footnote> Second, the methodological individualism of thinkers like Hobbes, who conceive of the state as explicable “in terms of the properties of its smallest constitutive parts, namely human beings,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History," 339.</d-footnote> prevent the theory from having any explanatory power in the realm of social science. Here, Mannheim’s situational determination <em>at least</em> has the advantage of having the <em>pretense</em> of sociality built into the model.</p> <p>For Horkheimer, ideology is not merely an individual falsehood, but has a “specific function in social struggle.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 314.</d-footnote> It is therefore a <em>functionalist</em> concept rather than a mere metaphysical entity or moral-political judgment about the pathological nature of action or thought. While emphasizing the primacy of the social may lead to worries about how such social entities are grounded, unlike Mannheim, Horkheimer recognizes that the social nature of ideology is explicable in terms of the sensuous material activity that societies engage in:</p> <blockquote> <p>The predominant ideas of an epoch have roots that go deeper than the ill intentions of certain individuals. Such ideas are endemic to a given social structure, whose outlines are given by the way in which individuals sustain themselves at the time. The basic process whereby primitive hunters or fishermen secure their existence dictates not only their material mode of life, but in a certain sense their intellectual horizon as well. Similarly, the form of life based upon this primitive level of development not only conditions the actual life of the individuals, but also has a significant influence on their knowledge of the external world, as well as on the content and structure of their general understanding of life. The same point applies to more differentiated forms of society: <em>the intellectual life of individuals is bound up with the life process of the social body of which they are a part and which determines their activity</em> [emphasis mine].<d-footnote>Ibid., 360.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Ideology, then, is <em>not</em> a precondition for agency or group formation, but rather the <em>result of a material social process</em>. However, it is a result which subsequently serves as a presupposition of the social process in a dialectical manner. To conflate ideology, i.e., a <em>result</em> of the process of social activity, with the activity itself, is to make a category error. There is a whiff of more traditional Marxism in this account:</p> <blockquote> <p>it is impossible to understand the content or nature of peoples intellectual makeup without knowledge of the epoch in which they live, or indeed (leaving the primitive peoples aside) without knowing the specific position they occupy in the social production process. The vital functions necessary to sustain and further human existence have not been combined within every single individual since the time of the primitive hunters and fisherman; rather, such functions are distributed amongst the various groups within society. But this also entails the differentiation of the whole of thought [<em>geistige Leben</em>], which develops internal contradictions.<d-footnote>Ibid., 361.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>More orthodox strands of Marxism would mostly concur that one cannot understand one’s intellectual makeup without understanding their position in class relations. However, this is a <em>weaker</em> claim than the Vulgar Marxist conception of <em>strict</em> reflection theory. This weakening of the Vulgar Marxist view allows Horkheimer’s view to escape historical relativism, as “[t]he relativity of a proposition and ideology are two rather different sorts of things. The limits to what may be [sic] rightly be called ideology are constantly set by our current state of knowledge.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 362.</d-footnote> Ideological falsehood is not falsehood simpliciter, but a specific type of falsehood defined on the basis of function.</p> <p>Given that the Frankfurt School thinks that ideology is the result of a social process, one might rightly ask <em>what</em> function gives rise to ideology. Here, the notion of ideology as <em>false</em> and <em>obfuscatory</em> comes to the fore. In “Notes on Science and the Crisis,” Horkheimer sketches out the way in which earnest attempts to ascertain the truth may still count as ideological insofar as they obfuscate the true nature of society:</p> <blockquote> <p>Not only metaphysics but the science it criticizes is ideological, in so far as the latter retains a form which hinders it in discovering the real causes of the crisis. To say it is ideological is not to say that its practitioners are not concerned with pure truth. Every human way of acting which hides the true nature of society, built as it is on contrarieties, is ideological, and the claim that philosophical, moral, and religious acts of faith, scientific theories, legal maxims, and cultural institutions have this function is not an attack on the character of those who originate them but only states the objective role such realities play in society. Views valid in themselves and theoretical and aesthetic works of undeniably high quality can in certain circumstances operate ideologically, while many illusions, on the contrary, are not a form of ideology. The occurrence of ideology in the members of a society necessarily depends on their place in economic life; only when relationships have so far developed and conflicts of interest have reached such an intensity that even the average eye can penetrate beyond appearances to what is really going on, does a conscious ideological apparatus in the full sense usually make its appearance. As an existing society is increasingly endangered by its internal tensions, the energies spent in maintaining an ideology grow greater and finally the weapons are readied for supporting it with violence.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis" from *Critical Theory*, 7-8.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>That ideology obfuscates the immanent contradictions in society does not entail that one may simply dispel ideological illusions via shining a light upon it. Contra later Critical Theorists who insist on ideal discursive conditions, ideology is not <em>merely</em> illusion, and hence no number of exhortations to the truth can suffice to remove it.<d-footnote>I'm thinking predominantly of Habermas here. For an evisceration of Habermas' theory of communicative action, see Raymond Geuss, "A Republic of Discussion: Habermas at ninety," *The Point*, 18 June 2019, &lt;https://thepointmag.com/politics/a-republic-of-discussion-habermas-at-ninety/&gt;</d-footnote></p> <p>Ideologies may function well in their role, but like other machines, can break down and cease to function. When ideologies break down, not all its adherents jump ship. Rather, when the ideological superstructure and its requisite institutions falter or no longer can no longer play their role in the reproduction of society, those who benefit from the prevailing social order remove the mask of liberal humanitarian reasoning to reveal the hideously fiendish face of brutality beneath it. Or, as Horkheimer notes in <em>Dawn and Decline</em>, “[t]he less stable necessary ideologies are, the more cruel the methods by which they are protected.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Dawn" from *Dawn &amp; Decline*, 17.</d-footnote> The rise of fascism in the 30s, and the ever-growing threat of an eerily similar authoritarian capitalism today, show that the Enlightenment flickers as it falls prey to its own mythos, leaving behind only ash and soot, a testament to its spent potential. The revelation that the myth of Enlightenment was not an eternally valid truth, but a construction which displaced earlier myths, causes monopoly capital to put less weight on it and more weight on repression, just as someone who injures their right leg places more weight on their left.<d-footnote>Such a distinction presages Althusser's distinction between the Repressive State Apparatus and Ideological State Apparatuses by over a generation. See Louis Althusser, *On Ideology* (London: Verso Books, 2020), 15-22.</d-footnote></p> <p>If ideology is functional, <em>where</em> is this functionalism? The answer is that it lies in human action and thought. To that end, the following section lays out the <em>obfuscatory</em> function that ideology plays in hiding the immanent contradictions of bourgeois society.</p> <h3 id="an-adjectival-not-a-nominal-account-of-ideology">An Adjectival, Not a Nominal Account of Ideology</h3> <p>As we have seen, the concept of ideology is <em>not</em> an abstract metaphysical entity like a <em>Weltanschauung</em>, but a <em>functionalist process</em>. Rather than stipulate ideology as abstracta à la Mannheim, the Frankfurt School treats ideology as <em>adjectival</em>. That is, to paraphrase Herr Morain, for the Frankfurt School, ideology is false consciousness, with an emphasis on <em>false</em> and not on <em>consciousness</em>. That ideology is conceived of as falsehood is not unique to the Frankfurt School, obviously, but what separates the IfS is its recognition that there is a moment of truth in ideology and in all thought. This subsection traces the causal chain that gives rise to ideological distortions, starting from its most abstract components toward a more determinate answer based in the capitalist mode of production itself.</p> <p>The aforementioned paragraph from “Notes on Science and the Crisis” shows that ideology is not bullshit in Harry Frankfurt’s sense: that is, speech which is unconcerned with the truth whatsoever.<d-footnote>See Harry G. Frankfurt, *On Bullshit* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005), 47-62.</d-footnote> This is a point at which Horkheimer and Mannheim are in agreement. Both think that ideology is neither actively deceitful nor unconcerned with the truth. This point is worth mentioning since careless theories of ideology often reduce the concept to either bullshit or deception. Rather, for Horkheimer, many well-intentioned intellectual programs become ideological because they unintentionally obscure the immanent contradictions within society. Intellectual programs of this type abound, many of which fall prey to double determination. Indeed, this is a recurrent problem with positivism of all stripes.</p> <p>But why does science in the capitalist epoch tend toward ideological obfuscation? If ideology is neither bullshit nor malicious falsehood, then one may rule out the Vulgar allegedly-Marxist theory that it is merely a matter of bourgeois self-interest to deceive the masses. Theories that rely on conspiratorial deception are themselves non-Marxist, as they attribute agency to the putative Great Men of History instead of the masses engaged in antagonistic economic social relations. Rather, focusing on why this paragraph on ideology appears in “Notes on Science and the Crisis” is elucidatory. The rest of the essay contains a theme that returns in the opening chapter of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>: the instrumentalization of reason. Speaking of scientific inquiry before 1914, Horkheimer notes that the Enlightenment program of bourgeois criticism against Scholasticism had fulfilled its task by the mid-19^th^ century.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis," 5.</d-footnote> The resultant endeavor was thus the description and classification of phenomena that did not concern itself with distinguishing the relevant from trivial. After overcoming Scholasticism, Enlightenment scientific inquiry ceased criticism, and therefore dogmatically assumed that its premises were eternal and unchanging. It thus went from being a liberating force to a conservative one, which maintains extant social relations. Consequently, the mechanistic view of science that predominated was more attuned to maintaining society as it was rather than advancing it. This led scientific inquiry to eschew questions about social progress, which in turn forced it to rely on “a set of unexplicated, rigid, and fetishistic concepts”<d-footnote>Ibid., 6.</d-footnote> rather than attending to the real “need […] to throw light on them by relating them to the dynamic movement of events.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>The root of this failure is not science itself but the social conditions which relegate it to a bureaucratic role in the day-to-day management of capital instead of rational inquiry. Scientific inquiry is in the grasp of two contradictions, as Horkheimer explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>First, science accepts as a principle that its every step has a critical basis, yet the most important step of all, the setting of tasks, lacks a theoretical grounding and seems to be taken arbitrarily. Second, science has to do with a knowledge of comprehensive relationships; yet, it has no realistic grasp of that comprehensive relationship upon which its own existence and the direction of its work depend, namely, society.<d-footnote>Ibid., 8.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>These two contradictions are related, since both stem from a lack of investigating society. More critically, these contradictions arise <em>because</em> the economic order on which scientific inquiry depends is itself enmeshed in immanent contradictions. The reification of human activity encompasses not only the factory floor, but also the ivory tower. The division of intellectual labor has incentivized the renunciation of totality. Moreover, the <em>aims</em> of science are not its own, as science “is determined in the scope and direction of its work not by its own tendencies alone but […] by the necessities of social life as well.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> That is, capital conducts science as part of its process, and the rise of what Adorno and Horkheimer call the “administered world” shows that monopoly capital’s intimate relationship with the state plays an important role. Since the state and capital play a predominant role in the scientific crisis, “that crisis is inseparable from the general crisis.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 9.</d-footnote> Scientific inquiry that is subject to the double determination is, by that fact, ideological. But this division of academic labor is one that must be imposed upon the scientist. The forces that impose limitations on scientific inquiry have their root not in the realm of thought but in capitalist social relations. Hence, to uncover the false element in ideology we must abandon the idyllic pretensions of intellectual clarity and descend into “the hidden abode of production.”<d-footnote>Marx, *Capital*, 119.</d-footnote></p> <p>The growth of this thought is ideological insofar as it papers over the immanent contradictions within economic activity and the legal form. Yet this is not a function of malevolent actors suppressing the truth, but rather the result of Enlightenment’s ambiguous relationship with capital. The Enlightenment’s aim of liberating humanity from its superstitions may have extirpated existing myths, but in so doing it marshaled up myths of its own: those of rationalization, formalization, and regulation.<d-footnote>Horkheimer and Adorno, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, 3.</d-footnote> All that reason cannot subjugate underfoot must be committed to the flames; it is for this reason that “Enlightenment is totalitarian.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 4.</d-footnote> Alongside this standardization comes the principle of <em>equivalence</em>: bourgeois society “makes dissimilar things comparable by reducing them to abstract quantities.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> But the very moment of rationality’s domination over nature is empty. Rather than standing alongside it, man is subjected to the very Enlightenment myths which he conjured up. The unified schematic of earlier philosophical epochs proves less useful to capital than its fragmentation into sundry specialized sciences, all of which avoid the critical steps of justifying their tasks or relating them to an overall whole. In short, since the real subsumption of labor to capital is the true cause of the false and obscuring elements of ideology, one at last finds that one’s thought is not autonomous.</p> <p>If ideology is fundamentally false, then what is conversely true? Here, the concept of <em>totality</em> as the opposite of ideology is important to stress.</p> <h3 id="ideology-and-totality">Ideology and Totality</h3> <p>The concept of ideology must be counterposed to that of totality. Since ideology both obfuscates immanent contradictions in a social totality and plays a role in class struggle, totality must strip away the illusory element of ideology. But how might one go about doing this? Here, two facets of the Frankfurt School tradition provide us with the tools to overcome the overgrowth of ideology that papers over the real foundation of capitalist social relations: that of <em>interdisciplinarity</em> in the critical theory of ideology and doing <em>justice to the particular</em>. Immediately upon his ascension to the directorship of the IfS, Horkheimer stressed the need for interdisciplinary investigation to address the crisis of scientific knowledge. In his inaugural address in this capacity, Horkheimer attempted to lay out the lacunae in extant attempts at uniting disparate phenomena under the label of totality.</p> <p>Social philosophy, the discipline with which Horkheimer identified himself, requires viewing people not as autonomous, atomic individual subjects (as bourgeois philosophy since at least the time of Hobbes has done), but rather as “members of a community”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," in *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 1.</d-footnote> and consequently attempts to understand “phenomena that can only be understood in the context of human social life: […] with the entire material and intellectual culture of humanity.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Even though the withering of German Idealism spelled the dissolution of classical social philosophy, one must still look to Hegel to see how the cunning of spirit makes particular ends universal.<d-footnote>Ibid. Though of course, Hegel's argument in the *Lectures on the Philosophy of History* is bourgeois in the sense that it relies on the Smithian division of labor as a universal constant rather than a development of the capitalist mode of production.</d-footnote> While the empirical researcher must delve into the slaughter-bench of history, Hegel thought philosophy raises us to the standpoint of the owl of Minerva, providing consolation and reconciling injustices with the development of reason. The transfiguration of reality which occurs in this practice also reconciles the particular to the universal, so that one cannot fully actualize oneself in the context of a state, though the state exists as an end in itself.<d-footnote>Ibid., 5.</d-footnote> As the prestige of German Idealism decayed during the latter half of the 19th century, the metaphysics of objective spirit was replaced with a naive optimism in the pre-established harmony of individual interests and a Whig history. But this worldview proved empty, and individuals increasingly viewed the world as a medley of arbitrariness. The claim that individuals partake in the organic unity of the State, which, <em>qua</em> ethical community, is itself a part of the dialectic of history. When it went by the wayside, people saw brute facts as naked, requiring a theory to use. Even the neo-Kantians got in on the action in the late 19^th^ to early 20^th^ centuries via their attempt to show that there existed some higher realm outside the scope of positivism.<d-footnote>Ibid., 6. One may cite Hermann Cohen in the sphere of philosophy, Hans Kelsen in the legal sphere, and Mannheim in the sociological field as exemplars of this neo-Kantian approach.</d-footnote></p> <p>These social philosophies are right to articulate a supra-individual sphere, but also have shortcomings: they are still too positivistic and individualistic.<d-footnote>Ibid., 7.</d-footnote> Their insistence on this methodology forces them to rely on metaphysical abstracta (e.g., the Hegelian <em>Volksgeist</em> or the various false assumptions that economists have always made) that render the theory unable to explain distinctively <em>social</em> phenomena. One further complication is that there are often mutually exclusive methodologies <em>within a given scientific domain</em>. As Marx notes, what separates classical political economy from its Physiocratic predecessors is in part a methodological difference: while the Physiocrats focused on a concrete example of labor (viz., agricultural labor), Smith’s advance consists in throwing out “every limiting specification of wealth-creating activity”<d-footnote>Marx, *Grundrisse*, 104.</d-footnote> to the abstract universality of labor as such. To repeat a theme from Section 3.3, <em>only</em> a dialectical approach of the kind that Marx outlines in the <em>Grundrisse</em> can overcome the antinomy between the overly reductive individualistic approach of early bourgeois philosophy and the overly abstract and indeterminate approach of Mannheim and Durkheim.</p> <p>The crisis of the social sciences has its origin in the division of labor that makes the social sciences possible in the first place. In particular, the strict bifurcation of empirical social research and social philosophy renders both worse off than uniting the two via a dialectical continuum. The heart of this dialectical relation is one of interdisciplinarity: “the task is to […] pursue […] larger philosophical questions on the basis of the most precise scientific methods, to revise and refine their questions in the course of their substantive work, and to develop new methods without losing sight of the larger context.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 9-10.</d-footnote> Philosophy must give empirical work its animating impulses but also must be left open to be changed by its results. Thus, there is a need to gather disparate fields together in collaboration to pursue the questions in this dialectical fashion. Philosophical questions get integrated into scientific study; the results of such studies advance philosophical knowledge. Hence, this is a social process: a fitting one, given the social nature of the object of analysis.</p> <p>There is one remaining problem. Recall that Mannheim’s account of ideology is lacking because it is so broad that it does not do justice to the particular, as it involves placing competing worldviews in a titanic struggle over and above the political struggles that flesh and blood people undertake. Despite our best efforts, one may worry that the comprehensive critical theory of ideology sketched out here is still inadequate in this respect. The idea of totality is counterposed to ideology: totality is truth and ideology is false. Hence, we need some concept of totality to explain <em>why</em> ideology is false consciousness. This task has become more pressing given the increasing broadsides against the concept of totality in the decades since the decline of the original generation of the Frankfurt School.<d-footnote>See, e.g., Jean-François Lyotard, *The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge*, trans. Geoff Bennington and Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984).</d-footnote> Though the influence of postmodernism on the academy has waned, the initial suspicion of a unity which crushes underfoot the possibility of the creation of new game rules remains.</p> <p>Of course, critiques of totality are not new. These criticisms have been, historically, the domain of the Right and levied against <em>liberal</em> insistence on the sovereignty of reason.<d-footnote>See, *inter alia*, Joseph de Maistre, "On Divine Influence in Political Constitutions" from *Considerations on France*, ed. Richard A. Lebrun (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2006), 49-53.</d-footnote> But if we allow ourselves to dispense of the concept of totality, the critical theory of ideology becomes pallid and intellectually barren, as there is no universal metric by which one may measure the content of ideologies, as the world becomes a “medley of arbitrariness.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 3.</d-footnote> If this is the case, then there is no reason to prefer a critical theory of ideology over a Mannheimian sociology of knowledge, as both will be founded upon unstable metaphysical foundations. Without the ability to unify social scientific inquiry under one banner, we risk falling prey to those objections which state that there is simply too much knowledge for any intellectual enterprise to account for.<d-footnote>See, e.g., F. A. Hayek, "The Use of Knowledge in Society," *The American Economic Review* 35, no. 4 (Sep. 1945): 519-530.</d-footnote> On the other hand, to dogmatically assume the objective possibility of totality is to commit a grave philosophical sin, as it presumes the very conclusion it aims to establish.<d-footnote>Indeed, this is why introductions in philosophy are unphilosophical, as philosophy should progressively unfold the immanent intellectual content that lies latent inside the object of inquiry. Georg Wilhelm Fredrich Hegel, *The Phenomenology of Spirit*, ed. Terry Pinkard and Michael Baur (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 3.</d-footnote> One must subject one’s own intellectual tools to criticism before using them.</p> <p>The solution to this problem first appears in the Young Marx’s writings, which stress that criticism which contented itself with criticism of ideas was insufficient as it did not apply this analysis to concreta. This does not imply that we know material relations <em>a priori</em>, as Marx’s hitherto mentioned analysis of the method of political economy shows. To give putatively concrete entities more determinate content requires us to put concreta in the context of <em>social</em> relations, thereby giving material conditions a totality. It is for <em>this</em> reason that Marx considered all previous versions of materialism deficient; by foregoing the social and practical elements of material relations, one treats materialism as a mere object of contemplation.<d-footnote>See Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, 143.</d-footnote></p> <p>It is for this reason that the IfS’ insistence on both a theoretical and empirical element to their research as well as a collaborative work ethic allowed it to prosper, if only for a moment. The image of the bourgeois intellectual, isolated and productive, is one which is ill-suited to the task of remedying the faults with scholarly inquiry today. Its reified nature suits those with niche interests, but the academy’s self-perception as an outdated relic has some merit today. The ceaseless exhortation for academics to justify themselves belies an insecurity that they can no longer serve either capital or knowledge. In attempting to serve both masters, the modern academy has served neither.</p> <p>By contrast, Horkheimer saw fit to stress that totality is the way <em>out</em> of the intellectual crisis of our age. The crisis <em>arose</em> in the first place because disparate fields assume contradictory but useful assumptions which seem impossible to reconcile into a totality.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 7.</d-footnote> But not every grouping of intellectuals is up to the task. Indeed, the common criticism that the IfS set too lofty a goal for any group of intellectuals to accomplish would be a valid criticism if the aim of the group were merely to interpret the world. While this may make good material for academic self-aggrandizement, it is no way to change the world. The Institute failed not because its goal was unrealistic but precisely because the institute did not embrace its interdisciplinary and partisan nature <em>enough</em>. Interdisciplinarity can only grasp the totality once it entails not only a shared research program between intellectuals of different stripes, but <em>also</em> a shared commitment to some form of praxis. Contra later generations of critical theorists, critical theory must not be an exercise in retreating into abstraction to satiate Rawlsian hunger, as it then becomes meaningless abstracta. Rather it must be a theoretical tool which can be placed in the only group which can overcome the total reification of all life both inside and outside the academy: the international proletariat.</p> <p>At this point, the reader may wish for a concrete example of what a critical theory of ideology <em>looks</em> like, and how it is connected to the concept of totality. Luckily, Horkheimer provides us with one when analyzing the bourgeois revolutionary in his sprawling essay “Egoism and Freedom Movements.”</p> <h3 id="theory-and-critique-of-the-bourgeois-revolutionary">Theory and Critique of the Bourgeois Revolutionary</h3> <p>To fully appreciate the interwoven nature of the Frankfurtian <em>Ideologiekritik</em> and <em>Ideologietheorie</em> we must recognize that the predominant object of analysis that Horkheimer examined during the 1930s was bourgeois philosophy. Being a good historical materialist, he traces its development during the ascent of the Third Estate from the 16^th^ to 18^th^ centuries in “Egoism and Freedom Movements.” In said essay, Horkheimer’s <em>theory</em> that philosophy in the Early Modern period responds to and develops out of the rising power of the (as of yet still subordinated) bourgeoisie is intertwined with a <em>critique</em> of said philosophy as obfuscatory. This obfuscation arises not due to malevolence, but is an inversion of the <em>real</em> premises on which capitalism operates.</p> <p>At first glance, one may think that the substantive disagreements between thinkers in this period prevents a systematic analysis of philosophical thought therein. Every student of political philosophy knows that writers never tire of contrasting Hobbes the pessimist with Rousseau the optimist, of those whose view of human nature as selfish and reprobate drives them to conservatism with those whose view of human nature as virtuous and uncorrupted drives them to liberalism or anarchism.<d-footnote>See, e.g., the final chapter of Carl Schmitt, *Political Theology* (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2005). While Schmitt's contrast is with counterrevolutionary thinkers like de Maistre and anarchists like Bakunin, and not with liberal thinkers like Hobbes and Rousseau, it is a useful read insofar as it plays on the same distinction.</d-footnote> Even before Hobbes’ time, Horkheimer sees Machiavelli and More as <em>dramatis personae</em> with the roles of realist and pedagogical optimist respectively.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements: On the Anthropology of the Bourgeois Era" from *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 49.</d-footnote> Both camps have their respective thinkers. Even Machiavelli finds a rival in his native Italy with Tommaso Campanella’s <em>Civitas Solis</em>, which emphasizes the capacity for a utopian society where reason reigns and discards all envy, property, and cause for discord.<d-footnote>Tommaso Campanella, *La città del sole* (Milano: Adelphi eBooks, 2023). &lt;https://archive.org/details/lacittadelsole0117camp&gt;</d-footnote></p> <p>Yet despite this apparent antinomy, there are points of unification between the two camps. The first is a rejection of the Aristotelian conception of value that governed previous forms of political thought in the West in favor of a view of human nature that appealed to “historical, political, and psychological analysis.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 50.</d-footnote> In so doing, both camps attempt to maintain a pretense of neutrality: a pretense that does not bear much fruit. As a type of science, political theory in this period needed an object of analysis: in this instance the isolated individual. This “unquestioned individualistic principle that regulated the relationships of owners to one another, [and] also […] the mental and instinctive barriers caused by the combination of this principle with the […] increasing differentiation of social classes”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> rendered theory in this period uncritical and dogmatic. By reducing political questions to mere questions of how Robinson Crusoes would interact, political philosophy of this type becomes ideological insofar as it papered over the differences internal to social life by reducing members of the society to interchangeable abstracta. While a Mannheimian ascription of ideal types to the two camps seems promising, one of the key differences between the Machiavellians and Moreans is one of power: those who emphasize “the aggressive […] drives of human beings indicated an interest in oppression, whereas the emphasis placed on educability […] was an expression of emancipatory tendencies.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 51.</d-footnote></p> <p>One further commonality between the camps is the condemnation of egoism and pleasure. Examples of this abound: from not only Machiavelli’s repeated insistence that a corrupt city can only stay free with great difficulty,<d-footnote>Niccolò Machiavelli, *Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio* (Milano: BUR Rizzoli, 2018), I.XVII-I.XVIII, p. 108-111.</d-footnote> but also Luther’s insistence that man’s free will can lead him away from God,<d-footnote>See Martin Luther, *Bondage of the Will*, trans. Henry Cole (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House Company, 1976), 122-7.</d-footnote> the Calvinist doctrine of total depravity, to the laws of Campanella’s City of the Sun, which treat women’s makeup and heels as capital offenses.<d-footnote>Campanella, *La città del sole*, 32. «Però è pena della vita imbellettarsi la faccia, o portar pianelle, o vesti con le code per coprir i piedi di legno; ma non averiano commodità manco di far questo, perché chi ci li daria?»</d-footnote> This distrust of egoistic behavior continues up through the victory of the Third Estate; Robespierre contrasts personal egoism to egoism which melds personal regard for love of the nation.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 53-4.</d-footnote> This undergirds his personal disgust toward corruption, which reaches its extreme during the trial of Danton.</p> <p>Yet at the same time as this development of bourgeois morality, bourgeois political economy also develops. The pre-capitalist prohibition on usury<d-footnote>St. Thomas Aquinas, "Question 78. Usury" from *Summa Theologiae*, vol. 38 (Westminster: Blackfriars, 1975), 233-254.</d-footnote> collapses from Calvin’s criticism,<d-footnote>I do not wish to overstate this point. Despite a *de jure* prohibition on usury, money lending did occur in Catholicism (e.g., the Church borrowing from the Fuggers). Additionally, Calvin is not as laissez-faire about money lending as is commonly assumed: he merely wishes to allow for money lending in *some* cases. This view is therefore less radical as it may seem, especially given the historical context. See David H. Eaton, "The Economists of the Reformation: An Overview of Reformation Teaching Concerning Work, Wealth, and Interest," *Sage Open* 3, no. 3 (July 1, 2013): &lt;https://doi.org/10.1177/2158244013494864&gt;.</d-footnote> and the rise of merchant capital gave the urban bourgeoisie an economic and political power that it had not yet seen. At first glance, it seems strange that a moral aversion to egoism develops at the same time as a general slackening of economic regulations that bound the bourgeoisie. After all, the economic aims of the individual members of the bourgeoisie are selfish at heart. What Horkheimer saw, however, is that it is <em>precisely</em> the rise of capitalism that gave rise to this ethical doctrine. The unleashing of capitalistic economic relations required restraints to keep it from running amok: this was a point that most of its advocates ceded.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 54.</d-footnote> While purely juridical and traditional restraints may have sufficed in the odd exception (e.g., Horkheimer cites 19^th^ century Britain, and perhaps one may add the U.S. of the same period), in most instances the state was necessary to guide capital. But morality qua social force (one should keep in mind that “ethics” and “morality” ultimately stem etymologically from words meaning “custom”) also helped restrain the beast. Hence, Horkheimer is correct to note that “the moralistic view of man contains a rational principle, albeit in mystified, idealistic form.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> If, as Marx and Engels note, “[t]he religious world is but the reflex of the real world,”<d-footnote>Marx, *Capital*, 53.</d-footnote> then one must add that it does not always mirror the real world, but in this instance inverts its form of appearance. The role of anti-egoistic morality in capitalist society, then, is <em>both</em> one side of an antinomy immanent to the social totality, <em>and</em> a belief system which obfuscates the <em>real</em> terms on which social reproduction occurs.</p> <p>That such a doctrine became popular as the bourgeoisie gained its footing <em>expresses</em> bourgeois social power; were there no ascendent capitalist relations, there would be no need to hammer home the critique of egoism ad nauseam. The proof of this is the inconsistency with which the espousers of this moral schema apply it to different social groups. While many of these moralists inveigh against luxury, many are reluctant to fully trust the poor. This is most prominent with Luther, whose thunderous polemic against the Peasants’ Revolt reaches almost comical proportions.<d-footnote>Martin Luther, "Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants" from *Luther's Works*, vol. 46, 55 vols. (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1967), 45-57.</d-footnote> Even Robespierre, radical though he was, is far from cordial toward the Énragés.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 103.</d-footnote> Moreover, this distrust expresses itself as a tolerance for egotistical striving for power–in <em>some</em> social classes. Luther’s supplication of the nobility, Machiavelli’s appraisal of Cesare Borgia, and the Jeffersonian aggrandizement of the yeoman farmer all share the willingness to overlook “the striving of the mighty for power, prosperity within sight of misery, [and] the maintenance of anachronistic and unjust forms of society.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 55</d-footnote></p> <p>This antinomy between the economic demand for competition, and therefore self-interest, on one hand, and the moral demand to eschew self-interested behavior has psychological effects on the bourgeois subject. The moral demand requires that one forgo lower pleasures for the sake of higher ones, and one is supposed to take pleasure in putatively uniquely <em>human</em> virtues.<d-footnote>Ibid., 57.</d-footnote> This requires that one also make peace with the world as it is: “[n]othing makes a person more suspect than the lack of an inner harmony with life as it happens to be.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 58.</d-footnote> All that is seen as frivolous is degraded as bestial. At the same time, the very frugality which this morality promotes is used as a means toward capital accumulation. This antinomy only becomes more outwardly expressed as capital claws its way to a position of economic dominance. For instance, Adam Smith’s valorization of thrift as the route to primitive accumulation attempts to merge the ethical and economic drives.<d-footnote>Adam Smith, *An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*, (Petersfield: Harriman House, 2007), 214-6.</d-footnote> Yet despite all the thrift and ambition of the poor man’s son, he finds in his old age that all his wealth was mere vanity.<d-footnote>Adam Smith,T*he Theory of Moral Sentiments*, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 211-2.</d-footnote></p> <p>This brief overview of the schematic of bourgeois revolutionary thought shows that Horkheimer’s account of ideology is at once both a detailed theory (which places thought in the context of the social conditions which give rise to it) <em>and</em> a <em>critique</em> of ideology (insofar as the moral system is obfuscating an immanent contradiction in bourgeois society).</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <h3 id="loose-threads-and-further-avenues-for-research">Loose Threads and Further Avenues for Research</h3> <p>There are a few loose threads that provide opportunities for further research beyond the scope of this essay. One may object that in the course of the investigation into ideology, I have remained too abstract insofar as I insufficiently investigated the material basis on which the ideological superstructure arises. In plain terms, one may argue that the critical theory of ideology is a project which aims at describing and unmasking the elements of the superstructure, but is insufficiently attentive to the matters of the economic base. One avenue for further research, then, is the application of the Frankfurt School’s critical theory of ideology to the economic relations that form the real basis of society.</p> <p>Of course, when talking about the real foundations of society, one must give a good account of how the real foundation of economic relations gives rise to the superstructure. One would find oneself in good company if one were to look to legal relations as a sort of bridge between the two, insofar as legal relations not only specify the conditions under which economic relations may be carried out, but also tie these relations to other spheres of life. Here, one should note that already by the time that Horkheimer ascended to his position as head of the IfS, Marxists of various backgrounds had criticized positivism for its uncritical approach to science. Evgeny Pashukanis rightly noted that legal positivism commits this sin when treating the legal form and its corresponding categories as eternal, unchanging essences instead of ideological categories that spring forth from the development of capitalism.<d-footnote>Evgeni B. Pashukanis, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism* (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2003), 73-85.</d-footnote> The legal form requires definite antinomies (e.g., the competing interests of different claimants) to function, as were there a unity of purpose among differing elements of a group, there would be no recourse to legal arbitration. Law, Pashukanis notes, mirrors the development of generalized commodity exchange, insofar as both are expedients “resorted to by isolated social elements in their intercourse with one another.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 134.</d-footnote> While Pashukanis is not optimistic about the ability to do away with this expedient entirely at present, the extent to which arbitration is resolved via the judiciary is historically contingent; previous modes of production relied more heavily on other means of social regulation (e.g., religious doctrine, ad hoc vigilantism). Further investigation into the legal form and its mediating role between base and superstructure, however, is a task for another day. The IfS were not primarily a group of attorneys, and hence a detailed analysis of how the legal form itself functions on ideological presuppositions (e.g., the antagonistic model of trial) is beyond the scope of the project.</p> <p>A good Marxist would rightly note that not just the legal form, but also the political economy on which it is based, has an ideological character thanks to its inability to criticize the premises which serve as foundational in its science. The net result is that said sciences lapse back into dogmatism and paper over the real fissures within bourgeois society with a false unity. Classical political economy, with its Smithian insistence in a transhistorical “certain propensity in human nature […] to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another”<d-footnote>Smith, *The Wealth of Nations*, 9</d-footnote> leads its adherents down a primrose path to an explanatory dead end when accounting for the origins of capitalism. The Smithian explanation of the origins of capital accumulation are quite individualistic.<d-footnote>Though not *entirely* individualistic, as Smith notes that landlords, for instance, have structural incentives to not engage in capitalistic economic relations.</d-footnote> For Smith, capital accumulates gradually in those who are frugal, while it fails to accumulate in spendthrifts.<d-footnote>Ibid., 216.</d-footnote> Even the poor worker may, if frugal enough, eventually may “maintain a menial servant”<d-footnote>Ibid., 214.</d-footnote> [though who would the frugal menial servant employ?] or he may waste it on vice. Even the putative extravagance of the rich man is explained as extravagance in maintaining his opulent servants<d-footnote>Ibid., 216.</d-footnote> [but would a truly frugal man not cut costs by doing their work himself?] rather than prodigality on behalf of the rich man. In so doing it reduces differences between rich and poor nations to a matter of a difference in <em>Volksgeister</em> and differences between classes as a predominantly <em>temperamental</em> difference rather than a difference in the means by which one labors. Of course, this is inverted: temperaments are not the cause of class differences, class differences incentivize differences in temperaments.</p> <p>Of course, any economist who would sully himself by deigning to read this essay (and therefore reading outside his own hallowed field) would rightly protest that Smith is outdated and that not all economics uses abductive reasoning of this type. Indeed, given the more quantitative nature of economics today and the indebtedness the field owes to the Marginal Revolution, Smith’s work is not even the same <em>type</em> of academic endeavor as that of the modern economists. Fair enough. But this does not mean that economists escape the problem of double determination. The model of <em>homo economicus</em> as a rational, self-interested agent underlies most microeconomic theories, but is itself an assumed fiction of dubious validity. Already by the turn of the 20^th^ century, bourgeois economists had criticized the view. Thorstein Veblen’s famous dismissal of the (now heterodox) Austrian School points out that not only is the view of human nature used oversimplified, but so removed from common sense views of human agency as to be useless:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains, who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact. He has neither antecedent nor consequent. He is an isolated, definitive human datum, in stable equilibrium except for the buffets of the impinging forces that displace him in one direction or another. Self-poised in elemental space, he spins symmetrically about his own spiritual axis until the parallelogram of forces bears down upon him, where upon he follows the line of the resultant. When the force of the impact is spent, he comes to rest, a self-contained globule of desire as before. Spiritually, the hedonistic man is not a prime mover. He is not the seat of a process of living, except in the sense that he is subject to a series of permutations enforced upon him by circumstances external and alien to him.”<d-footnote>Thorstein Veblen, "Why Is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science?" *The Quarterly Journal of Economics* 12, no. 4 (1898): 373-97, 389-90. https://doi.org/10.2307/1882952.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Stylistic prose aside, Veblen’s essay is instructive as it is an example of how economic models lose their explanatory power when one dares criticize its undergirding assumptions. Not only the concept of <em>homo economicus</em> but the desire-satisfaction or hedonistic theories of the good that much of microeconomics assumes is philosophically suspect. The former falls prey to an obvious Euthyphro problem while the latter fell out of favor after criticism from Robert Nozick,<d-footnote>Robert Nozick, *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (New York, Basic Books, 1974), 43-5.</d-footnote> hardly a bastion of the left!</p> <p>Despite its dubious philosophical origins, economic concepts reign supreme in areas even beyond its intended use. The rise of Law and Economics as an academic field stands out as one such area thanks to its increasingly predominant role in legal reasoning over the past several decades. The work of Richard Posner often involves porting over economic concepts to the law, and in so doing, porting over the uncritical abstractions of the field into real social relations. While a substantive critique of modern economic thought would be a fruitful endeavor, one should keep in mind that the neoclassical turn occurred decades after the collapse of the IfS, and hence a dialectical criticism of the movement is beyond the scope of the paper.</p> <h3 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks</h3> <p>I conclude by remarking on the theoretical virtues of the Frankfurtian account of ideology. Too often in contemporary theories of ideology, one sees that the author has forsaken a definite methodology, instead treating the concepts <em>ad hoc</em>. This consequently weakens the <em>Ideologietheorie</em> as the theory has no determining grounds on which it can stand. Of course, this in turn prevents the <em>critical</em> aspect of ideology critique from reaching its full force, as there is no method by which one can adjudicate the falsity of the object of investigation.</p> <p>On these matters, the Frankfurt School’s conception of ideology stands as a shining beacon which rises above the detritus of the tomes published after it. The IfS’ insistence on not accepting the given without subjecting it to critique, on the inability of bourgeois thought to adequately self-criticize, and by reiterating time and again that “it is not enough merely to correlate [...] ideas with some social group [...] [w]e must penetrate deeper and develop them out of the decisive historical process from which the social groups themselves are to be explained,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Social Function of Philosophy" from *Critical Theory*, 263.</d-footnote> the Frankfurt School stands head and shoulders above the unsystematic buffoons who came after them.</p> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Althusser, Louis. <em>On Ideology</em>.
