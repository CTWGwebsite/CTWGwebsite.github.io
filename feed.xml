This piece is about the limits of that theory and their implications for contemporary critical theory.<d-footnote>For an excellent survey of many of the compelling aspects of racket theory, see the other pieces in this dossier.</d-footnote> These limits have to do with Adorno and Horkheimer’s reliance on what John Milios and Dmitri Sotiropoulos describe as “a ‘microeconomic’ approach according to which the characteristics of the ‘dominant form’ of enterprise (individual capital) shape the whole capitalist system (the social capital), determining its patterns of evolutionary change.”<d-footnote>Milios and Sotiropoulos, *Rethinking Imperialism: A Study of Capitalist Rule* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), 116.</d-footnote><br/> Milios and Sotiropoulos trace this approach back to Rudolph Hilferding’s <em>Finance Capital</em> and contrast it with Marx’s “macroeconomic” approach in the third volume of <em>Capital</em>, which centers on the concept of social capital<em>.</em><d-footnote>Ibid</d-footnote> Although I find the overall argument of their study on imperialism lacking (in ways that can’t be gone into right now because of space), I still find this critique of the “microeconomic” approach to be extremely valuable, if only as a negative methodological principle that warns us against some of the pitfalls that ensnared a number of otherwise insightful Marxist thinkers, including Adorno and Horkheimer.<d-footnote>A few examples include Lenin (at times), Kautsky, Bukharin, and the Monopoly Capital school, especially Baran &amp; Sweezy, but, as Harvey points out, it remains an aporia in Braverman as well; David Harvey, *The Limits to Capital*, new and fully updated edition (Verso, 2006), 142 n.2.</d-footnote></p> <p>Let us begin by looking at a paradigmatic example of the “microeconomic” approach from Adorno’s “Reflections on Class Theory” before turning to Milios and Sotiropoulos’ reconstruction of Marx’s arguments in volume III of <em>Capital</em> and examining their implications. In section V of that essay, Adorno elaborates what would become the economic core of racket theory for the first generation of Frankfurt School critical theorists:<d-footnote>See J.E. Morain’s piece in this dossier, where he describes it as the second essential thesis of the racket theory problematic. </d-footnote></p> <blockquote> <p>In the market economy the untrue aspect of the concept of class was latent: in monopoly capitalism it has become as visible as its truth – the survival of classes – has become invisible. Competition and its struggles have led to the disappearance of much of the unity of the class,which previously held the competitors together in the form of the rules of the game and of common interests. It is so easy for the bourgeoisie to deny its own class character to the<br/> proletariat because in fact its organization has cast off the consensual form of like interests that had constituted it as a class in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has replaced this with the direct economic and political command of the large capitalists that used the same threat of the police against both their own supporters and the workers. This imposes on both sections of the population the same function and the same need, and it is this that makes it almost impossible for the workers to see that class relations are at work.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942) in *Can One Live After Auschwitz? A Philosophical Reader*, ed. Rolf Tiedemann (Stanford University Press, 2003)</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>This passage shows a number of characteristic features of the “microeconomic” approach critiqued by Milios and Sotiropoulos including:</p> <ol> <li>The temporal and conceptual division between “the market economy” and “monopoly capitalism,” which hinges on changes in the dominant form of enterprise to characterize the poles of its opposition.</li> <li>The claim that the competition of the market economy period has led to the disappearance of the previous unity of the bourgeois class, which took the form of rules of the game and common interests, and its implicit suggestion that there has been a fundamental change in the structural determinations or “laws” of the capitalist mode of production as a result of the above changes.</li> <li>The claim that this previous form of unity has been replaced by “the direct economic and political command of the large capitalists,” which further suggests that this postulated change involves the displacement of competition from the central role it had in Marx’s account as the primary form of appearance through which those structural determinations manifest themselves.</li> </ol> <p>These are the very features of a “micro-economic” approach that Milios and Sotiropoulos set out to discredit in Chapter 6 of their book <em>Rethinking Imperialism</em> by reconstructing the relevant arguments from volume III of <em>Capital</em>.<d-footnote>See Milios &amp; Sotiropoulos, *Rethinking Imperialism*, 115-120.</d-footnote> The most important point from that chapter is the recovery of Marx’s concept of social capital and its relation to competition. The authors show how, for Marx, it is competition that constitutes the various individual capitals existing within a social formation as parts of the total social capital through the formation of an average rate of profit. This is how the capitalist class is united as a class and how the unique structural determinations or “inner laws” that define the capitalist mode of production are made manifest. Therefore, the displacement of competition from its central position in regulating economic life would mean the elimination of the mechanism through which those determinations are realized, and so of the determinations as a whole, rather than just their transformation. It would mean an end to the capitalist mode of production as such, and thus also to the usefulness of Marx’s analysis of it.<d-footnote>Another way to think about this in terms of Adorno’s claim about the replacement of the former “rules of the game” by “direct economic and political command,” which would mean an end to the indirect forms of domination that distinguish capitalism from previous modes of production and discipline capitalists into acting as bearers of the capital relation.</d-footnote></p> <p>What does all this mean for racket theory? On the one hand, it seems clear to me that many of the phenomena Adorno and Horkheimer are trying to explain in terms of the rise of monopolies and the supposed elimination of competition that accompanies it—the increasing preponderance of relations of direct coercion reminiscent of pre-capitalist social relations, the decline of bourgeois individuality and the subjective autonomy that characterized it, the increasing integration of organized labor, and the working class more broadly, into the hierarchical organization of capitalist social forms—are real changes that require explanation. It also seems clear that key elements of their explanation—the changing character of the dominant form of capitalist enterprise, changes in the way competition is organized that entail, at the very least, a relative diminution of its prominence in a number of areas—also track real changes in the configuration of capitalist social relations during the 20th century. On the other hand, the intervention of Milios and Sotiropoulos leads me to conclude that those explanatory elements are themselves phenomena to be explained, and that this explanation must begin from the other direction, from the concept of social capital and its relation to the constitution of an average rate of profit out of intra and inter-sectoral competition (nationally and globally). I think many of the explanations offered by Adorno and Horkheimer will still be valuable to us as we move down from this level of abstraction, but they will also need to be reevaluated and reconfigured in the process.</p> <p>This means not only working out the intermediate mediations between the abstract level of social capital brought into focus by Milios and Sotiropoulos and the more concrete levels worked out by Adorno and Horkheimer, but also clarifying some of the questions left open by the austerity of the formers’ abstraction—questions surrounding the dialectical interplay between the competition (or relative lack thereof) at work in the formation of a sectoral average rate of profit and the competition involved in the formation of an inter-sectoral average rate of profit, how these play out differentially on the national and the world markets, and how they relate to the play of tendency and counter-tendency surrounding the organic composition of capital and the “circumstances which, independently of the proportional division of surplus value into capital and revenue, determine the extent of accumulation.”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Capital: A Critique of Political Economy*, vol. I, trans. Ben Fowkes (Penguin Classics, 1990), 747-761.</d-footnote> I could even see the development of a renewed monopoly capital framework as the outcome of this work, but one which is at once more structural and more dialectical, centered on the <em>tendency</em> towards the elimination of competition at a sectoral level and the way in which this very tendency gives birth to new and renewed competition in other areas, before itself succumbing to the forces of intra-sectoral competition in the sector(s) of its origin and shifting locations (but not losing its overall force as a tendency), although this remains only a possibility until the necessary work is done.<d-footnote>David Harvey’s analysis in *The Limits to Capital*, in particular in Chapter 5, “The Changing Organization of Capitalist Production,” where he develops a concept of an "equilibrium between the tendencies toward centralization and decentralization” may be useful in this regard, although his neglect of the concept of social capital and consequent underdevelopment of the role that the dialectical interaction of intra- and inter-sectoral competition play in the phenomena he analyzes would need to be corrected; Harvey, *The Limits to Capital*, 137-155.</d-footnote> We must return to Marx—to all three volumes of <em>Capital</em>—with these questions in mind, and at the same time we must turn to the working out of these dynamics at the level of class struggle in concrete contemporary social formations, a turn which remains a perpetual promissory note in the analysis of Milios and Sotiropoulos.<d-footnote>Alongside the problems mentioned here, Milios and Sotiropoulos’ analysis also runs into a number of other problems surrounding their methodological nationalism that are too complicated to get into here. I plan on addressing them in a follow-up piece dedicated specifically to that task.</d-footnote></p>]]></content><author><name>Mac Parker</name></author><category term="Racketology"/><category term="report"/><category term="write-up"/><category term="study"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Putting the Racket-concept to the Test]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Class and Rackets, Part II - Domination</title><link href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_part2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Class and Rackets, Part II - Domination"/><published>2025-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_part2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_part2/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post23-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post23-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post23-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post23.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="class-and-rackets-domination">Class and Rackets: Domination</h2> <p>In a short note, Horkheimer writes that “the basic form of domination is the racket.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist” in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 287.</d-footnote> During the early 20th century, the terms “racket” and “racketeering” were primarily associated with Chicago criminal gangs that arose during the early 20th century as a reaction to poverty amongst recent immigrants from Europe and the prohibition of alcohol. These gangs primarily consisted of a network of variegated criminals organized in a strict, paramilitary hierarchy.<d-footnote>James Schmidt, “‘Racket,’ ‘Monopoly,’ and the Dialectic of Enlightenment,” *Persistent Enlightenment*, January 2016; Andrew W. Cohen, “The Racketeer’s Progress: Commerce, Crime, and the Law in Chicaǵo, 1900-1940,” Journal of Urban History 29, no. 5 (July 2003): 575–96; Edward Granter, “Strictly Business: Critical Theory and the Society of Rackets,” Competition &amp; Change 21, no. 2 (April 2017): 94–113; Robert M. Lombardo, Organized Crime in Chicago: Beyond the Mafia, (University of Illinois Press, 2012), 149–167.</d-footnote> Through the efforts of anti-union propagandists, these terms came to be associated with (radical) union officials during the New Deal era, an attempt to hinder the extra-legal, “criminal” activities undertaken by unions for collective action.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> In this context, Kirchheimer points out that lawyers used to frame “racket” as the “monopolistic practices […] carried through by physical force” for “singling out particularly objectionable methods serves as a convenient tool for bringing the guilty to account and depriving them of the sympathies of the community at large”<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 159.</d-footnote> against who are deemed miscreants or criminals. In a critical re-appropriation of the term, Horkheimer generalizes the concept of the racket to encompass most groups with vested interests in the social reproduction of monopoly capitalism insofar as they directly or indirectly rely on personal domination and violence to sustain themselves. The <em>civilized</em> ruling class is revealed to have always consisted of various rackets, hidden in plain sight through its control over production and disciplinary mechanisms, unlike the racket of the criminal that represented “more irrational, more primitive racket relative to the state-protected class monopoly.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Theorie des Verbrechers” [1939-1942] in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 270</d-footnote> Hence, Kirchheimer points out that</p> <blockquote> <p>if there is a difference in methods as between”haves” and “have-nots,” firstcomers and latecomers, “decent citizens” and “racketeers,” there is no difference in their aims which are essentially the same: establishment of domination over a segment of the process of production or distribution.<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 130.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In a letter to Franz Neumann, Horkheimer posits that (unlike the civilized rackets) the petty criminal skips over the “stage of production and seeks to appropriate to himself as much of the circulating surplus value as possible,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Theorie des Verbrechers” [1939-1942] in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 269</d-footnote> the criminal is an affront to the false universality of capitalist society who doesn’t keep up appearances, hence questions the very essence of capitalism. The criminal is disciplined through punishment to internalize the norms of society as more subtle institutions of socialization failed to do its job.<d-footnote>Michel Foucault argues a similar point in *Discipline and Punish*. The early critical theorists recognize the non-identity between the goals of these institutions and the embodied individual that cannot be fully socialized as an object. There is room for mediated agency in their conception.</d-footnote> In stark resemblance to Pashukanis’ argument regarding the legal form, Horkheimer observes that legal domination acquires its own logic immanent to capitalist social relations; unlike primitive sanctions or feudal punishment, the criminal as ordained by the legal form “is the exponent of a conflict necessarily inherent in society itself.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Theorie des Verbrechers” [1939-1942] in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 266</d-footnote> Criminal law shields the ruling rackets from the excesses that are generated by capitalist society, as those who cannot adapt to existing conditions lash out against those who benefit the most. The existing conditions that crush and exclude those who fail to keep up with its demands is rationalized in society by the “halo of necessity.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and The Family,” 93.</d-footnote> Poverty and crime are hypostatized as a natural part of any society, and the idea that ‘some people will always be poor or bad’ is instilled to <em>civilized</em> citizens through the universalization of the legal form and its constitutive ideological apparatuses. The legal institution becomes a tool of the ruling rackets in monopoly society to exert violence on the individuals and expand its horizons; the ruling class as rackets “make use of their productive apparatus as robbers make use of their guns.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> <p>With monopoly capitalism, the combination of the rise of the relative surplus population with furthering integration of the circuits of capital into social life led to the development of “antagonisms within the ranks of the oppressed masses themselves.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Rather than forming a class united by shared oppression/exploitation, the workers and the excluded are incentivized to form antagonistic groups within themselves (as rackets) as a response to the monopolistic organization of society—hierarchically organized and self-interested groups attempt to gain as much of the available social surplus through direct domination and violence directed towards other groups, regardless of their social position. The intra-class conflict of rackets within the ruling class is universalized under the antagonistic conditions of integration and exclusion, the employed section of the workers (in the global north) and their hierarchical trade unions, for Adorno (and Horkheimer), “became monopolies” that “terrorized outsiders” to secure their relative position.<d-footnote>Adorno, *“*Reflections on Class Theory,” 100.</d-footnote> The labour aristocracy is reframed as racket.<d-footnote>In letters to Horkheimer, Franz Neumann and Herbert Marcuse pushed back against the argument that the working class has fully adapted to the monopolistic structures of society. Neumann in particular responds that only labour leaders (as managers) have been integrated into racket logic. For Horkheimer, however, the working class constitutes a conscious class rather than a racket only when it shares collective agency. (See Neumann’s letter to Horkheimer in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 17, 482-483.) In one draft of the “Sociology of Class Relations”, Horkheimer incorporates the criticism by adding the paragraph but ultimately removes it — “There are some decisive differences between Labor and capitalistic monopolies(…)The term Labor, however, comprises both the leaders who appropriate the profits and the members who create them. The same process which, both in reality and ideology, has made Labor an economic subject, has transformed the laborer, who was already the object of the entrepreneur, into the object of his organization as well(…) While the masses think of themselves as the creators of their own destiny, the leaders use them as a commodity. The fact that Labor is a monopoly does not mean that its members, labor aristocracy excepted, are monopolists.” (Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”)</d-footnote> The revolutionary working class struggle is replaced by hierarchical labour organizations that trade labour as a “merchandise, manipulate it, advertise it, and try to fix its price as high as possible.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> With hindsight, we can observe that even these labour organizations in the global north have been largely disintegrated with the total expansion of market rationality throughout the world. Rackets appear not as part of the integration of working class organizations as it did during the 40s but as the result of exclusion and pauperization that accompanies capitalist integration. The anti-Democratic reactionary movements appearing the across the world such as MAGA, and the militant Hindu religious movements in India are accompanied by the rise of surplus populations being appropriated by the ruling rackets, the “criminal” that previously aroused the spirits of ruling classes by attempting to mimic their actions is a tool to be instrumentally used and subsequently discarded.<d-footnote>In a letter to Horkheimer, Marcuse explicitly writes about the “harmony of interests between the union bureaucracy and the large monopolistic companies” and the “in some striking cases, the collaborationist attitude of the workers seems to be even stronger than that of the unions.” During the 1930’s lead to the “the famous Jack and Heintz factory in Cleveland (good article on it in the New Republic of Oct. 25), which is praised (also by the Communist Party) as paragon of the true relationships between workers. It is perhaps the most outstanding example of voluntary coordination of labor, and it shows how smoothly fascism can progress in a democratic environment.” (See Marcuse’s letter to Horkheimer in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 17, 476-477.)</d-footnote> Kirchheimer writes</p> <blockquote> <p>Racket connotes a society in which individuals have lost the belief that compensation for their individual efforts will result from the mere functioning of impersonal market agencies. But it keeps in equal distance from, and does not incorporate, the idea of a society wherein the antagonism between men and inanimate elements of production has been dissolved in the image of a free association for the common use of productive forces. It is the experience of an associational practice which implies that neither the individual’s choice of an association nor the aims that the latter pursues are the result of conscious acts belonging to the realm of human freedom.<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 161.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Society tends towards the formation of competing “pressure” groups as rackets that does not hesitate to use any means necessary to carve out a space for its own reproduction through the acquisition of the circulating surplus value as an adaptation to the conditions of monopolization. The intensification of the impersonal forms of control characteristic of capitalist society through the market and the legal form in-turn intensifies the forms of personal domination that highlighted pre-capitalist social organizations, traditional forms of domination such as caste are explicitly mobilized as rackets to navigate class society. Horkheimer claims the primary function of groups is to protect itself from outside aggression, and stabilize its own social position in society. Hence groups themselves maintain the conditions of social reproduction “in which they have favored standing; they uphold and violently ward off changes that could endanger their monopoly. They are rackets.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist” in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 288</d-footnote> Durkheim’s false distinction between organic and mechanical solidarity collapses in-itself through racket logic, the division of labour organized through vast interconnected networks throughout society is maintained through personal relationships of domination in-and-between groups. What was purportedly in conflict with the forces of capitalism according to liberals was absorbed by capitalism for its continual expansion. As Horkheimer writes</p> <blockquote> <p>“Today the expression of human needs is distorted no longer by the dubious economic indicators of the market, but by their conscious molding in a giant system of socio-psychological surgery. The misery of unsuccessful competitors and of backward groups can no longer be ascribed to anonymous processes which permitted a distinction between them as economic subjects and as human beings. The downfall of vanquished opponents, competitors as well as whole social strata, minorities and nations, is decided upon by the elites.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>The elite theory of Vilfredo Pareto is reframed as racket formation particular to specific social conditions rather than the transhistorical determination of power relations as such. For the early critical theorists, elite sociology partially describes the social dynamics within modern society but fails to understand its causes, which leads to its reactionary conclusions.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, *Introduction to Sociology*, ed. Christoph Gödde, tr. Edmund Jephcott (Stanford University Press), 13–14.</d-footnote> The partial description of elites circulating at the top throughout history as democracies are eventually reduced to oligarchies are rather the descriptions of rackets competing amongst themselves for resources while imposing strict control over their subjects. Unlike Pareto’s transhistorical formulation of the relations of power, the concept of the racket leaves the possibility of a truly free and democratic society open through the dissolution of rackets through the formation of a political class.</p> <p>As James Schmidt points out, the language of rackets and monopoly were tactically removed from manuscripts that were eventually published as the <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> to escape censorship by American authorities. They resorted to an esoteric mode of communication to develop an immanent critique of enlightenment rationality as it arises with the development of capitalism, it is particularly illuminating to understand the concepts introduced in the <em>Dialectic</em> to understand the functioning of class domination, misogyny and racism in monopoly society.<d-footnote>Schmidt, “‘Racket,’ ‘Monopoly,’ and the Dialectic of Enlightenment,” and Eva-Maria Ziege, “The Irrationality of the Rational : The Frankfurt School and Its Theory of Society in the 1940s,” in *Antisemitism and the Constitution of Sociology* (University of Nebraska Press, 2014), 274–96.)</d-footnote> Their primary thesis that enlightenment and myth are deeply interrelated with enlightenment rationality (with the transition to capitalism) leading to a blind domination over nature, alongside the explicit integration of tradition with capitalism.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Fascism was the result of identification with the blind forces of the economic apparatus.</p> <p>Adorno and Horkheimer understand the return of mimesis in modernity as an adaptive response to the conditions of total integration of Capitalism with the domination of nature and eventually humanity.<d-footnote>Theodor W Adorno and Max Horkheimer, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, 2016, 148.</d-footnote> The impersonal forces of capitalism i.e. the dominance of the market and the formal equality of the legal form, which leads to identification with the inert functioning of the world with itself. For Freud, the death drive is the attempt to conquer (qua mastery over) death through a constant repetition of the actions that brings the individuals close to an inorganic state, a drive to kill a part of oneself and identify with the external functioning world to conquer death itself.<d-footnote>Sigmund Freud, *Beyond the Pleasure Principle: Group Psychology and Other Works ; (1920-1922)*, 38–55.</d-footnote> Like the death drive, mimicry in capitalism is an irrational repetition to control the irrationality of existing reality, hence</p> <blockquote> <p>“By echoing, repeating, imitating the surroundings, by adapting himself to all the powerful groups to which he belongs, by transforming himself from a human being into a member of specific organized bodies, by reducing his potentialities to readiness and ability to conform to, and gain influence in, such bodies, he can finally manage to survive. It is survival by practicing the oldest biological means of survival: mimicry. Modern culture is a resurrection of oppressed mimetic practices.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Apropos mimesis, Rackets are “pragmatic totalities,” hierarchical organizations that are pragmatically oriented towards the existing world that hypostatizes the existing conditions of social reproduction. Pragmatism, both in its commonsensical and philosophical sense “corresponds to limitless trust in the existing world” <d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, ed., “On the Problem of Truth,” in *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, 192.</d-footnote> Elderly advice and the realism of international politics amounts to the same things—anything that challenges the current state of affairs is deemed as a childish tantrum that fails to understand reality. For Horkheimer, the masses understand their own economic situation but that (immediately) does not translate into revolutionary class consciousness but is sublimated into the blind acceptance of existing reality as pragmatic/realist decision making. The philosophy of pragmatism of William James and John Dewey as its primary representatives limits the conception to truth to corroboration of ideas with use, it ends with reifying concepts for their usefulness as posited by the existing state of affairs.<d-footnote>Ibid, 195.</d-footnote> The convergence of philosophical thinking and the rationality of groups as pragmatic totalities is a mimetic response to the impersonal forces of the market. For Adorno, this limitless trust qua pragmatism leads to the flattening of everything to easily identifiable and measurable categories, all art (qua commodities) starts to resemble each other. Genuine differences are eliminated through the dream of eventually joining the ruling rackets.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory”, 96. Similarly Horkheimer write about this in the context of Caste Society: “The terrible differentiation in ways of work and life, which enables the Indian life-process to succeed, was rendered intelligible by the idea of the transmigration of souls, according to which birth into an upper or lower caste is the consequence of actions in an earlier life. The lowest classes find in this idea a special reason for not wanting any change in the system. In so far as a Pariah can say that he is faithful to the prescriptions for his caste, he hopes that in his next birth he will rise into the Brahman caste and enjoy its privileges.” (Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 63)</d-footnote> Adorno writes,</p> <blockquote> <p>“the prisoners of the system, strive to bring about this leveling by imitating their stunted rulers in the hope of receiving a pittance in their old age, if only they can prove themselves worthy. The belief that they might be able to form an organized class and conduct a class war crumbles in the minds of the dispossessed along with liberal illusions.”<d-footnote>Adorno, *“*Reflections on Class Theory”, 96.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Unlike the pragmatists, the objective of materialism (according to the early critical theorists) was to demonstrate that corroboration between ideas and reality qua the notion of use is itself a “historical occurrence” that arises in definite social relations. To demystify the concepts of realism that are taken as granted.</p> <p>For instance, the so-called “natural” facts of human society such as a family are reframed as a hierarchical racket with the figure of the father at the top. The family that serves to socialize children into existing conditions through discipline and punishment, the child integrates herself the conditions of domination within the family unit through a memetic response, “submission to the categorical imperative of duty has been from the beginning a conscious goal of the bourgeois family.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family”, 99.</d-footnote> The family qua racket is cemented as the primary conservative force in society that compels a sense of economic and social responsibility for the wife and children dependent on the husband’s reliance on a wage. Rebellion against the family and the patriarchal system is conceptualized as abandonment/disloyalty to one’s own group, domination is sublimated into the very consciousness of a person.<d-footnote>Ibid, 120,</d-footnote> Similarly, official legal titles are certifications that signify belonging to a racket through the state apropos the legal form. Individuals are <em>integrated</em> into the system through the process of certification, “legal and illegal titles […] are distinguished by the fact that the world has an all-embracing organization; none should escape its protection; if proscribed by its agencies, one is forsaken.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist” in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 289.</d-footnote></p> <p>In the outline for a planned book on rackets, Horkheimer writes, “The fact that history is a history of class struggles means that history is a history of rackets fighting among themselves and against the rest of society.”<d-footnote>Typescript “Notizen zum Programm des Buches, 3.8.1942,” Max Horkheimer Nachlass XI.10.1 https://arcinsys.hessen.de/arcinsys/detailAction.action?detailid=v3007298. Adorno similarly writes, “In the image of the latest economic phase, history is the history of monopolies. In the image of the manifest act of usurpation that is practiced nowadays by the leaders of capital and labor acting in consort, it is the history of gang wars and rackets.” Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 100.</d-footnote> The concept of racket applied in history reveals the logic of domination immanent in class society that shackles the individual within groups, that in times of crisis results in a rapid unleashing of irrational destruction and violence. Under the limits imposed by class society, individuals are forced to integrate themselves into groups that will rule over groups below them—The oppressed become the oppressors of “those further down” the hierarchy.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Liberalism based on the idea of social contract between individuals in the <em>state of nature</em>, that will render individuals free from domination failed to fulfill its promise. Traditional forms of domination and rule that were understood as <em>inadequate</em> to liberalism was instead integrated into the economic apparatus, “by abolishing the classes in this way, class rule comes into its own.”<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 100.</d-footnote> For the IfS, only through the establishment of a rationally organized society that with the association of free individuals<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Traditional and Critical Theory” in *Critical theory*, 218.</d-footnote> by a conscious working class struggle will lead to the unfolding of genuine democracy and freedom.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In a letter to Horkheimer, Kirchheimer states that as ideology of existing conditions has deeply steeped into consciousness—it has been accompanied by a distrust of theory, rise in conspiratorial thinking, and explicitly anti-scientific sentiment. Ideology has “withdrawn from psychology into the anthropological fundament,”<d-footnote>See Neumann’s letter to Horkheimer in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 17, 482-483.</d-footnote> which calls for a “materialist anthropology” to understand and supplant existing conditions.</p> <p>The IfS had been writing during monopoly capitalism with authoritarian state presence throughout society apropos cold war liberalism, fascism and state socialism. Which starkly resembles neo-liberalism apropos the identity between unfettered market forces and state of today. Sociology of the racket provides us the framework to better understand the mutually interlocking relationship between reactionary organizations, class structure of a society with expansion of the informal economy and the democratic backsliding seen throughout the contemporary world—for instance the relationship between the state, big business, and militant Hindutva groups in India could be understood as composed of mutually interlocking rackets arising with large scale monopolization and decreasing economic stability. It provides a valuable research program to investigate our contemporary world.</p> <p>Horkheimer writes about how initiation rituals of tribes could be understood as integration into rackets, the ritual signifying the socialization of an individual into group norms against the world.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The sociology of the racket also shows the possibility of genuine freedom and democracy that can imagine a racket-free society made up of freely associating producers. The utopian potential of a liberated society, even at the darkest of time, even with total integration of everyone into an irrational society, the future remains open with possibilities through the very conditions of existing society. As Adorno writes,</p> <blockquote> <p>In reified human beings reification finds its outer limits. They catch up with the technical forces of production in which the relations of production lie hidden: in this way these relations lose the shock of their alien nature because the alienation is so complete. But they may soon also lose their power. Only when the victims completely assume the features of the ruling civilization will they be capable of wresting them from the dominant power. The only remaining differentiating factor is reduced to naked usurpation. Only in its blind anonymity could the economy appear as fate: its spell is broken by the horror of the seeing dictatorship. The mimicking of the classless society by class society has been so successful that, while the oppressed have all been co-opted, the futility of all oppression becomes manifest. The ancient myth proves to be quite feeble in its new omnipotence. Even if the dynamic at work was always the same, its end today is not the end.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 110.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Racket society produces its own antinomy with the formation of anti-racket political and artistic units with “with [their points] directed upwards”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist.”</d-footnote> that aim to abolish racket society through the formation of a political class of the exploited and subordinated.</p>]]></content><author><name>Re Tejus</name></author><category term="Racketology"/><category term="report"/><category term="write-up"/><category term="study"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part 2 on the Frankfurt School's racket concept]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introducing Racket Theory</title><link href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing Racket Theory"/><published>2025-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/cain5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/cain5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/cain5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/cain5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br/></p> <p>The texts collected here belong to the materials on ‘racket theory’ composed by members of the Institute for Social Research between 1941 and 1944.

We have found it helpful to divide our subsequent analysis of the racket theory project into three major sections, which are not exclusive in terms of content. Our narrative starts with the earliest use of the term in Max Horkheimer’s essay “The End of Reason” (1942). After this, we turn to analyzing the stream of texts which were explicitly composed for or about publication(s), mostly written between spring 1942 and fall 1943. Then we treat the topic of reflexivity and the specific character of the racket theory project that flows from its particular form of reflexivity. Finally, we briefly discuss some particularities of the core racket theory texts before concluding. Translations from additional German sources are our own.</p> <h2 id="the-beginnings-of-racket-theorie">The Beginnings of ‘Racket Theorie’</h2> <p>In the development of early Critical Theory as a whole, racket theory is in many respects the successor to the Institute’s 1930s socio-psychological studies on the role of ‘authority,’ defined as the psychological internalization of class domination,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in modern society, which culminated in the 1936 publication of <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em>. The remaining members of the Institute—specifically Horkheimer, Adorno, Löwenthal, and Paul Massing—would return to the more general problematic of ‘authority’ and ‘authoritarianism’ in the late 1940s with the <em>Studies in Prejudice</em> series that Horkheimer edited with Samuel Flowerman for the American Jewish Committee, and especially in <em>The Authoritarian Personality</em> (1950), where Adorno would build off of the same Frommian concept of the authoritarian character structure that grounded the 1936 <em>Studien</em>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p> <p>Horkheimer’s essays “The Jews and Europe” (1939) and “Authoritarian State” (1940) were also important precursors to the racket theory project. These two essays touch on many themes that would reappear a few years later in the racket theory corpus: fundamental commonalities between fascism and liberal capitalism, the decline of law and return of direct domination, the worthlessness of reformism, etc. The essential difference between these essays and the racket theory corpus is the absence of any unifying concept in the former. From 1942, the concept of the racket would quickly come to fill this role in both their short- and long-form reflections on economics and politics. It would serve as the term mediating between their presentation of the constant of impersonal domination in capitalist society as a totality and the variable forms of more personal or direct domination through which the former increasingly found expression in the everyday lives of the subjects of late capitalism.</p> <p>The story of the racket concept in particular begins with the final issue of the Institute for Social Research’s official journal, <em>Studies in Philosophy and Social Science</em>—the short-lived (1939-1942) English-language successor to their <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> (1932-1939)—in Summer 1941, which has retrospectively become known as the “State Capitalism” issue (Nos. 2 and 3 of Vol. IX), named after the central idea of Friedrich Pollock’s two controversial contributions: “State Capitalism: Its Possibilities and Limitations” and “Is National Socialism a New Order?” Though Horkheimer and Adorno’s work from this period has traditionally been interpreted as an extension of Pollock’s state capitalism thesis, such readings almost entirely ignore the substantial critiques both Horkheimer and Adorno level against Pollock’s theory—largely in agreement with the better-known critiques of Neumann and Kirchheimer—in the ensuing debate over whether the Institute should publish the text at all.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> This confrontation with Pollock’s theory was a crucial ingredient in the development of the racket theory project.</p> <p>The final issue of <em>Studies</em> opens with Horkheimer’s essay “The End of Reason,” which was written in close collaboration with Adorno. In the Horkheimer Archive, amidst the drafts for “End of Reason,” there are a number of excerpts, with unique handwritten corrections and notes for revision, from one section of the essay in particular under the title “Racket Theorie.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> This passage seems to have acquired a newfound, retrospective significance for Horkheimer and Adorno as they worked on the earliest drafts of the <em>Fragmente</em> in Spring and Summer 1942. The excerpt provides a provisional definition of the racket as a form of social domination—“[p]rotection is the archetype of domination”—after its violent historical reappearance in the transition from the “interlude” free market liberalism to monopoly capitalism: “Monopolism has […] led social domination back to its true nature which had continued to operate only where the humane form of domination had left some loopholes to inhumanity.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> The passage concludes with the earliest formulation of a research program devoted to the racket itself: “A study of such border phenomena as racketeering may offer useful parallels for understanding certain developmental tendencies in modern society.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> The apparent marginality of racketeering relative to the monopolistic planning of states is exactly what made the racket so promising as a model for the explanation of monopoly.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p> <h2 id="thwarted-plans-for-publication">Thwarted Plans for Publication</h2> <p>Prompted by internal debates opened during the composition and publication of the “State Capitalism” issue, Horkheimer prepared a memo (the “LA Memo”) in April 1942 about the ‘non-philosophical’ problems—many of them related to so-called state capitalism—that would have to be tackled in his planned book on dialectics, which would eventually become <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>. The word ‘racket’ only appears once in memo, indicating that it was not yet the focal concept for the planned work. A slightly earlier letter to Felix Weil from March of ‘42 related Horkheimer’s desire to recruit Weil as well as Friedrich Pollock (and perhaps Henryk Grossmann and Arkady Gurland) to assist with writing the sociological-economic part of the dialectics book.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p> <p>By the Summer of ‘42, Horkheimer and Adorno had begun work on what would become <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, and they were increasingly aware that an extended treatment of their new thinking about class, authority, and the economy would not fit in the ‘dialectics book.’ This was largely due to the fact that the theory of the racket was conceived from the beginning as a multidisciplinary project, something Horkheimer and Adorno could not accomplish without collaborators in political science, law, and economics. In August of ‘42, they—probably Adorno working on the basis of prior discussions with Horkheimer—produced another memo (“Notes for the Programme of the Book”) outlining their plans for an independent book on what they were now calling “racket theory”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> or “sociology of rackets.”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Inspired by this second memo, Adorno quickly drafted the essay “Reflections on Class Theory,” a text which he told Horkheimer could be “readily broken up and transferred to different places in the end product [i.e. the planned book] as needed.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p> <p>The rudimentary plan of these memos gestated into more concrete plans for a 1943 yearbook—presumably a continuation of or successor to <em>Studies in Philosophy and Social Science</em>—that would include contributions from the likes of Arkady Gurland, Herbert Marcuse, Franz Neumann, and Otto Kirchheimer. Kirchheimer’s contribution would be about “rackets in the labor movement” and “analyze the differences between industrial monopolies and the trade unions,” while Neumann would write “a study on the possibilities of political forms which do not have the character of rackets” and Gurland’s essay would deal with “certain statistical data with regard to the changes in the working classes.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Marcuse’s contribution was presumably to be the essay he was working on at the time, a study of “how new forms of control, manipulation, and behavior express themselves in the language of this age” entitled “Operational Thinking and Social Domination.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Horkheimer confided in Marcuse that he “[had] the feeling that the realization of this plan would be the first step toward giving [sic] a piece of Critical Theory which would not be purely philosophical.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>There were, however, some significant problems with this plan. As Thomas Wheatland has shown in <em>The</em> <em>Frankfurt School In Exile</em>, the Institute for Social Research’s affiliation with Columbia University, which facilitated the former’s emigration to the United States in 1934, was contingent on both the Institute’s financial autonomy and the continuation of their pre-existing social research using quantitative and empirical methods.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> With the Horkheimer circle’s bitter break with Erich Fromm, the leading empirical social researcher of the group, in 1939 and the Institute’s rapidly worsening financial situation, they had become incapable of fulfilling either of Columbia’s desiderata by the outbreak of WWII.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> In addition to recurrent suspicions towards the Institute core’s Marxist, or even communist, sympathies<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and an undisclosed quota system that limited the number of Jewish faculty members,<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> a more permanent affiliation between the Institute and Columbia’s sociology department was endangered by the latter’s internal disputes over its own direction and leadership between 1939 and 1942. After the Institute failed to secure a source of external funding for any of the ambitious group research projects it proposed in this period, Horkheimer, who had since moved to Los Angeles in Spring 1941, finally responded to Columbia’s reluctance to support the Institute beyond offering a teaching appointment to Franz Neumann in 1942 by making the decision to radically downsize the Institute in late 1942.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> The lack of any institutional affiliation meant that funding for the yearbook would be hard to come by.</p> <p>At the same time, several of the contributing authors—Marcuse, Neumann, and Kirchheimer—had recently obtained gainful employment at the Research &amp; Analysis branch of the United States Office of Strategic Services and would have little time to complete their projected contributions.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> On top of these two problems, one of the major planned contributors, Henryk Grossmann, found himself increasingly at odds with the inner circle of the Institute both theoretically and interpersonally.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Plans were quickly scaled back from a full-fledged yearbook to a smaller mimeographed edition,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> but even this apparently proved unfeasible. Otto Kirchheimer actually completed his essay and wound up getting “In Quest of Sovereignty” published in <em>The Journal of Politics</em> in May 1944 after it became clear that the Institute’s publication plans had come to naught. Marcuse would eventually repurpose some of his work from “Operational Thinking…” for <em>One Dimensional Man</em>.</p> <p>That’s as far as plans for publication in book form got, but Horkheimer also produced a series of fragments related to the racket idea and a substantial essay on the topic. While we know that Horkheimer started work on his fragments in 1942, the exact date is not entirely clear. The most likely possibility is that at least some of them were started in Spring or Summer 1942 and thus provided a rough conceptual basis for the subsequent racket theory texts. It is also unclear what exactly Horkheimer planned to do with these fragments: whether they were intended for publication or merely a means for internal theoretical edification or etc.</p> <p>In early 1943, Horkheimer began writing a more cohesive essay on racket theory, hoping against hope that he still might be able to produce the planned yearbook or at least find some outlet for the racket idea. The text received the deceptively unimaginative title “On the Sociology of Class Relations” and would only be published in full posthumously. Horkheimer sent out copies of an early draft to various Institute associates—Marcuse, Kirchheimer, and Neumann—for feedback in September 1943 and produced a finished draft on the basis of their feedback shortly afterwards. “Sociology of Class Relations” stands out as the most integrated and wide-ranging text in the entire racket theory corpus.</p> <p>Horkheimer continued to periodically revise the fragments with input from Adorno until Spring 1944, when they were all, with the sole exception of “On the Ideology of Politics Today,” compiled together in a staple-bound typed booklet (complete with a table of contents, pagination, and a prefatory note) under the title “Concepts as a Supplement to the Festschrift for Friedrich Pollock.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> As that title suggests, this compilation was a companion volume to the original <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em> version of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, which Horkheimer and Adorno had dedicated to their friend and collaborator Pollock on the occasion of his 50th birthday. The preface to the <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em> would also be the first and last time that “On the Sociology of Class Relations” was mentioned in print. Adorno and Horkheimer explained that the essay was excluded along with “all English works produced in the same period, regardless of their connection to the fragments,” but nevertheless belonged to the “whole work” which they “[hoped] to complete… in the not too distant future.”<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p> <p>After the limited ‘publication’ (so to speak) of the “Concepts” and the <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em>, Horkheimer and Adorno shelved the racket theory texts for a few years. They eventually returned to them in 1946-1947 while preparing the new edition of what was now titled <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> for publisher Querido and, slightly later, Horkheimer’s book <em>Eclipse of Reason</em>. Among the extensive changes they made to the text of <em>Dialectic</em> for the Querido edition, the fragment “Strafgefangene” (or “Prisoners”) from the “Concepts” was incorporated into the fragment “From ‘A Theory of the Criminal,’” itself a lengthy excerpt from the full “Theory of the Criminal” of the “Concepts.” Beyond this, none of the older, unpublished work was included.</p> <p>“On the Sociology of Class Relations” fared slightly better. In 1946, substantial sections of it were revised and repurposed for Chapter IV of Horkheimer’s <em>Eclipse of Reason</em>, “Rise and Decline of the Individual.”<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> Among the most radical of these revisions was the elimination of the concept of the “racket” from the text entirely.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> The publication of <em>Eclipse</em> marked the end of the Horkheimer and Adorno’s attempts to publish their writings on the racket from the early 1940s,<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> though not the end of their preoccupation with the problem of the disappearance of socialist internationalism with the ‘racketization’ of the labor movement.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p> <h2 id="the-reflexivity-of-racket-theory">The Reflexivity of Racket Theory</h2> <p>Much of the authoritative secondary literature on racket theory to date has approached these early sketches searching for some basic incoherence that is meant to explain why the project would ultimately remain unfinished.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> However, the points of incoherence often imputed to racket theory under the assumption of its necessary failure prove to be the same problems the critical theorists consciously adopted as their point of departure for the reflexive contextualization and construction of racket theory from the beginning.</p> <p>From its inception in “The End of Reason,” the concept of the racket has a paradoxical historical status: in the transition of modern capitalist society from “liberalism” to “monopolism,” the ‘archetype’ and ‘true nature’ of social domination that remains the condition of class society, i.e., ‘prehistory’ as a whole, is revealed.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> In each of their subsequent contributions to racket theory, Horkheimer and Adorno will contextualize their theoretical efforts both within the process of ‘racketization’ society undergoes in the transition from ‘liberal’ to ‘monopoly’ capitalism and in the ‘negative invariance’<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> of human prehistory as a whole. Closing his first thesis of his essay devoted to rackets, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942), Adorno formulates the historical discovery of prehistory in the language of the <em>Manifesto</em>: “All history is the history of class struggles because it was always the same thing, namely, prehistory.”<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> The last line of Horkheimer’s “On the Sociology of Class Relations” (1943) is a direct interpolation from Marx’s remarks on the method of political economy from the ‘Introduction’ to the <em>Grundrisse</em>: “the anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the ape.”<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> In a letter to Felix Weil from January 1943, Horkheimer explains: “The meaning of that truth is that once we know man, we can discover his beginnings in earlier forms of life. Once Fascism had developed in European society, we now are able to find its hallmarks in earlier stages of human history, but it would be an error to say that, because of those traces, the development was a necessary one.”<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> Throughout the fragments, the racket will appear under the dual aspect of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic,’ historical variable and prehistorical constant, according to this parallax. This accounts for the centrality of the problem of law in the sketches on racket theory, and more specifically on what Evgeny Pashukanis called “indissoluble internal connection between the categories of the economy based on the commodity and on money, and the legal form itself.”<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> For the subject of modern social domination is in the end neither the state as collective capitalist nor the conspiracy of the rackets, but “the unconscious colossus of real existence, subjectless capitalism, [which] inflicts its destruction blindly.”<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p> <p>In a pair of letters written in February 1943, Horkheimer is clear: the theoretical perspective required for racket theory is none other than the Marxian critique of political economy, which alone makes it possible for the social theorist to “to deprive liberalism of the weapon to think of itself as of the ‘natural’ economic system and to show up the identity of the meta-economic structure of both the present day collective and the old free market system.”<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> The twist, however, is that the Marxian theory of social totality becomes illegible in the fragmentation of the social sciences into a system of rackets this theory is needed to critique: “This is what the critique of political economy, which established dialectical relations between the totality of the social sciences, has become among these academic groups, a kind of dealing between the different rackets which confirm one another that they are indispensable.”<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> The same ‘racketization’ of society in the transition from free-market, ‘liberal’ capitalism to monopoly capitalism that underlies and drives the development of racket theory simultaneously undermines and frustrates the intelligibility of the theory itself. For Horkheimer and Adorno, the false modesty of epistemological pluralism which posits the <em>a priori</em> insurmountability of the division of labor in the sciences is as vicious as the pre-established harmony of the sciences was in the dogmatic philosophical systems of the past. The dispute unfolding within the social sciences between special-scientific pluralism and the renaissance of metaphysical holism is interpreted as a refractory expression of a generalized social crisis characterized by the simultaneous fragmentation and consolidation of political rackets. The lack of conscious coordination between the sciences is the reverse side of an unconscious agreement each has with the existing order of society. This reality became increasingly pressing for the racket theorists in the 1940s as they found themselves increasingly forced to seek funding from various government and non-profit ‘rackets’ whose patronage was conditional on the silence of critical theory towards the total mobilization of American society during WWII. The content of racket theory rebounds on its form.</p> <p>In a letter written in August, 1942, on the style of his collaborations with Adorno, Horkheimer writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>I’m far from imagining that our thought could “break through in America” … . We no longer hope for more than that, should the day finally break, what we’ve written will be but a small star, flickering, though barely visible, in the horrific night of the present. For what else should the gaze which stares into the fireworks of magazines and the other slick products of scientific and unscientific mass culture see when it turns away from it all if not darkness? … Any theses of ours, as the guiding principles of a successful publication, would at best only add a new shading of color to the bouquet of rockets.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The degree to which their stylistic experimentation during the composition of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> was influenced by their conception of the racket as a form of social domination has yet to be fully explored.</p> <h2 id="additional-remarks-on-the-texts-and-their-content">Additional Remarks on the Texts and their Content</h2> <p>As mentioned above, all of the fragments that we are translating and publishing here were all included in a booklet except for “On the Ideology of Politics Today.” Before discussing the content of the fragments from the “Concepts” compilation, some attention must be given to this particular fragment. While this fragment is incomplete—it breaks off mid-sentence—it still contains a particularly pointed criticism of Friedrich Pollock’s theory of state capitalism, one which has prompted previous interpreters to attempt—unsuccessfully, in our view—to direct the criticism away from Pollock himself.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p> <p>The five fragments from the “Concepts” that we selected for translation and publication are all closely related on a thematic level. In particular, they dedicate significant space to analyzing the conflicted relation between rackets and law—both concepts serving as synecdoches for specific forms of domination. The particularism of the racket is also its “fundamental illegality;”<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> it is the antithesis of the abstract, universal domination of law. Despite the apparent conflict between rackets and law, they are inseparably bound together in reality. The state’s justice is founded by and can only be administered by rackets; law in class society is “set in pre-established harmony with the rule of cliques which hold weapons and means of production.”<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> Its apparent universality is set up for the advantage of a particular class. The law has an elective affinity with money, commodities, and private property. In spite of the universal validity of both forms, the sanctions of law gravitate towards the poor in particular just as commoditized wealth goes to the rich. Thus rackets and law are in a chiasmic relation of speculative identity and non-identity: rackets found the law; law is foundered on rackets.</p> <p>The figure of the criminal holds a special place in this tortuous interplay of universal and particular. The criminal is punished for transgressing the universally binding restrictions that enable collective survival in the state—the so-called common good—in the interests of their own benefit. But, as Horkheimer argues, “[t]he enemy is never the object of punishment, for it is always administered to the defenseless.”<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> Thus, punishment does not follow the logic of self-defense taught by Hobbes: it is an impassioned act of revenge against someone already disarmed that reveals the “illegality of the law.”<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> Law constitutes itself as human society’s defense against nature, but behind this rationalistic alibi is the same cruelly natural fate it was supposed to prevent: painful death without reason.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup></p> <p>Another form of false universality and unity assumed by the racket is the fascist ‘collective’ or ‘community.’ Whatever internal unity such a formation possesses must be placed in the context of its violent competition with other ‘collectives’ and suppression of the outcasts unlucky enough to be excluded from the benefits of any racket. Of course, this aforementioned unity is also largely transient, if not entirely illusory. Such ‘collectives’ are invariably characterized by violently enforced internal hierarchies and struggle within each level of their hierarchy. The racketized form of collectivity is present also in the working class in the shape of the reformist unions and parties that narrowly seek after privileges for their members. This is not an inevitable result, but rather a betrayal—one that leads to the destruction of its all-too-clever perpetrator.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>Turning our attention to the two memos, we must recognize that these are somewhat special documents, as they were not intended for external promulgation. We have chosen to translate and publish them because they provide unique insight into the Frankfurt School’s racket theory project and their internal working process more generally.</p> <p>The “LA Memo” (“On parts of the Los Angeles work program that cannot be carried out by the philosophers”) is difficult to date exactly, but it is definitely from some point in April 1942. The document is of special interest because of its strikingly clear formulation of the sociological and economic problems motivating the Institute’s research at the time. The language used in the memo indicates that it dates to the period when Horkheimer and Adorno still believed that a treatment of racket theory could fit into the ‘dialectics book.’ The “Notes for the Programme of the Book,” dated August 20th, 1942, were accompanied by thirty sheets of “excerpts from texts on the history of rackets” (seemingly compiled by Adorno) from September 15th, 1942.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> These excerpts were mostly from works from or about Ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy that dealt with topics relevant to the themes of the racket theory project (political power, state violence, etc).</p> <p>Both of these internal documents show the Institute’s continued interest in synthetic interdisciplinary social research that would incorporate history, philosophy, economics, sociology, and psychoanalysis. It also indirectly shows the difficulties of such a project. The ambitious outline found in “Notes for the Programme of the Book” recalls the similarly ambitious 1934 plans for <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em>, plans which the Institute was still incapable of fulfilling then despite having more financial resources at their disposal as well as actual stable working relationships between all the major contributors.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p> <p><br/></p> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketTexts/">Read the Fragments and Texts on Racket Theory</a></p> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ClassRelations/">Read “On the Sociology of Class Relations”</a></p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <p><br/></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>See <a href="https://jamescrane.substack.com/i/161511932/translators-note-reconstructing-the-formation-of-the-encore">James Crane, “Translator’s note: Reconstructing the Formation of the <em>Encore</em>.” in <em>Substudies</em> (blog), 4/18/2025</a> <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>MHA Na 1 <a href="https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/horkheimer/content/titleinfo/5668657">639</a>, [39]-[218]. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Max Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family” [1936] in <em>Critical Theory: Selected Essays</em> (Continuum, 2002), 68-69. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>For more on Erich Fromm’s importance for the Freudo-Marxist ‘analytic social psychology’ of the early Frankfurt School, see J.

Legal ownership was the ideological expression of the fact that a minority of people occupied a position which enabled them to exclude the rest of society from freely using the land or other instruments necessary for the continuation of social life on a given scale. The ruling class has absorbed the gifts of culture, that is to say, the difference between the total product of consumer goods and the bare necessities of life of those who produced them, and, though guided itself by controlled social forces, has determined the kind of goods to be made and the methods to be used.</p> <p>The privileges thus held by the ruling minorities throughout the ages were not altogether irrational. It is true that, in the last analysis, they were conquered and maintained by force; but the fact that the groups which enjoyed them were able to make use of that force for the organization and stabilization of some robust form of society was a sign of their being economically more advanced. Their rules promoted and conserved a mode of production which, at its hey-day was not inadequate to the developmental status of the productive forces. In this respect, the rulers represented a higher rationality than the rest of the population. In the later periods of their reigns, when the principles of organization, which they represented, were made obsolete by the progress of other parts of the population, their power became more convulsive and terroristic but, at the same time, became weaker and hence more irrational, finally approaching blind despotism. They were transformed into purely repressive factors. The social and cultural forms for which they stood, wearily maintained by their administrative apparatus against new possibilities of human association, exercised a mutilating effect upon the minds and faculties of mankind.</p> <p>The notion of class as it underlies the materialistic theory of history needs further elucidation. It does not refer to a consistent and homogenous unity. At least during the most typical periods, property of the means of production was not identical with their well-planned social use, nor with the existence of a unified will and determination. The various ruling groups understood each other fairly well whenever it was necessary to crush the resistance of the exploited masses or of any forces threatening to set up a new social rule. Thus, when it came to punitive measures against the progressive burghers of Southern France or even against the proletarian elements in Flanders, the worldly and spiritual powers of the Middle Ages, emperors, kings, and popes, forgot their traditional conflicts for the time being and united for the defense of the prevailing hierarchical system of society. However, medieval history offers no picture of solidarity among the rulers of the Christian world. On the contrary, there was a never ending fight over booty going on among the different hierarchical groups. Each wanted to assume authority over large areas in order to be nourished and housed and served by as large a population as possible. The same holds good for the ruling groups of Greek antiquity, as represented by the city-states and factions. The ruling class, held together by the common interest in its specific mode of exploitation has always been characterized by its internal struggles, by the efforts of one of its parts to secure the spoils that others might appropriate. The struggle for security among the elite has been a race for the most far-reaching command possible, in other words, for control of production.</p> <p>For several reasons this nature of class was obscured during the 19th century. The emancipation of the bourgeoisie from the restrictions of mercantilism and the release of the laborer from serfdom seemed to have abolished the insurmountable differences among the various sectors of humanity. Economic competition embracing all parts of the population was more peaceful although more thorough and universal than the quarrels and discords of the great in times past. [It was one of the achievements of Marx’s writings that he,]<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> while stressing the progressive features of capitalism, unveiled its oppressive character and showed the old issue of power behind the apparently rational set-up of the market system. Today the similarity of the different historical phases of the bourgeois economy with regard to the principle of exploitation tends to become manifest. Even academic economists are shifting from the optimistic concept of an economy gravitating towards sheer harmony to a pessimistic power theory. Formerly they blamed Marx for the introduction of the “non-economic” concept of exploitation. Now they go much too far in the vindication of non-economic factors. They tend to replace economy by a more than simple political or psychological explanation of present-day events.</p> <p>In fact, the idea of competition as it was conceived in liberalistic theory was misleading in many respects, two of them being particularly important for the theory of class relations. First, the nature of competition among workers was essentially different from the nature of competition among capitalists. Competition among workers, at least during the heyday of liberalism, simply meant that there were so many workers that wages could hardly rise above the cost of bare living, and in many cases even dropped below it. This comes to the fore in the nature of the labor contract. Fascism has only revealed what was already inherent in liberalism: the delusive nature of the labor contract as a deal between partners equally free. It would be a grave theoretical mistake to denounce the contract in modern totalitarianism as a mere formality, and stress its genuine authenticity under liberalism. In both phases of the economic system, the aim of the contract may well be considered as the maintenance of that same basic inequality which is shrouded in its democratic language.</p> <p>Second, the monopolization of certain key positions within capitalist competition is much older than the monopolistic economy. Competition among the entrepreneurs themselves was never quite as free as it seemed. Here we are not thinking of state interference with industry, which economists are wont to [reproach]<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> as long as big business does not take the state under its own management. We have in mind rather the inequality resulting from the different degrees of social power exercised by various industries. Such differences depend largely upon the stage of economic concentration and centralization of the respective industries, upon its importance for the regular functioning of the economic life of the nation, and upon its affiliation with the military and administrative power apparatus. Therefore, the groups which by birth or deceit, brutality or shrewdness, expertness in engineering machinery or human relations, by marriage or adulation, have come into control of a part of the total capital invested in industry, form a hierarchy of economic power which has limited the free play of competition at each of its stages. The discovery that the national economy of various capitalistic countries depended upon 200, 60, or even a smaller number of families, brought this situation into a clear light which eventually made the veil of free competition transparent.</p> <p>The development of capitalistic society according to its own inherent tendencies caused the progressive traits of competition to disappear. It severed the link between the needs of consumers and the profit-interest of the individual entrepreneur; it diminished the possibility, slight as it was, of an independent mind gaining access to an independent position; it reduced the number of relatively autonomous economic subjects, who by the very fact of that plurality had an interest in the functioning of general law and in its impartial administration. All this vanishes in the later stages of capitalism and allows society to revert to more direct forms of domination, which in fact never had been quite suspended. Yet this process is not only a reactionary one. While the inequalities among the entrepreneurs are shifting into monopolistic and eventually totalitarian control of national life, the relation between Capital and Labor undergoes a most characteristic change. During the latest phase of capitalism, the working class has entered competition by adapting itself to the monopolistic structure of society. It has assumed a form which fits into the monopolistic set-up. Consequently its relationships to the different capitalistic groups are no longer radically different from those prevailing among the capitalistic groups themselves.</p> <p>The new situation is expressed in the concept of Labor (with a capital <em>L</em>) as it is recognized as a guiding intellectual principle not only in the minds of workers but also with the general public. Like Agriculture or Industry, or even sections of Industry, such as Steel, Rubber, and Oil, Labor is a collective term which is not an ordinary <em>abstractum</em> or <em>generale</em>. With regard to the individual elements included in their logical structure, such entities resemble a unit like State, Nation, Church, rather than a generality like Color, or Animal. They emphasize the concreteness of themselves as universal concepts, and disregard the elements of which they are comprised. Their logical structure mirrors exactly their objects. It stresses the collective individualities at the expense of the single individuals absorbed by them. The logical elements of the collective concept of Labor, i.e. the mass of ordinary members, are not the forces which, by their own ideas and spontaneity, determine the course of the whole. To use mathematical terminology, they are not so much the constant value with regard to the whole as the fluctuating one. On the contrary, the whole, i.e., the organization, determines and even overawes the individual, for the leaders, with their specific materialistic and power interests, with their philosophy and character structure, have an infinitely greater weight than any plain member.</p> <p>There is a decisive difference between the social units of our monopolistic society and those of earlier periods.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> All these older units are totalities in the sense that they are thoroughly organized, integrated, and ruled by a hierarchy. In contrast to modern totalities, however, the life of the totemistic tribe, the clan, the church of the Middle Ages, the nation in the era of the bourgeois revolutions, took their course according to mythological patterns which had assumed their shape in long historical developments. The patterns had become fixed images and models for the totalities, as did the Gospel for the church. True, such patterns, magical, religious, or philosophical, were intellectual authorities of the then present forms of domination. They reflected, as it were, the hierarchical stratification of society. But while they formed a cultural binding-substance which maintained a social formation even when its role in production had become obsolete, they also preserved the idea of human solidarity. This they did by the very fact that they objectified spiritual structures. Any system of ideas as far as it’s written in meaningful language, whether religious, artistic, or logical, has a general connotation and pretends to be true in a universal sense.</p> <p>To be sure, the objectivity and universality of the older collective units formed an ideology which constituted an essential condition of their parasitic existence in the body of society. But the patterns of organizations such as the medieval church did not directly coincide with the forms of material life. Organization in the strictest sense applied mainly to the hierarchy itself and to the ritual functions of both clergy and laity. Apart from that, neither life itself nor the intellectual framework by which it was reflected was completely integrated. The basic spiritual categories were not entirely fused with pragmatic considerations. Thus they maintained a certain element of independence and autonomy. They were not ready-made factory products, no plastic molds simply superimposed by the organization. The participation of the layman in the activities of such bodies remained separate from his daily work and life. There was still a cleavage between culture and production. This cleavage left more loopholes than the modern type of super-organization which virtually reduces the individual to a mere center of reaction. Modern universals, such as Labor, are integral parts of a unified social and economic system controlled by monopolies. By the very means of such universals, monopolies absorb the individual entirely and transform him into an element of the mechanism of production in which the so-called culture is only a cog. In short, the older forms of totalities which professed to comply with an aloof spiritual model, contained an element which is lacking in the purely pragmatistic totalities of monopolism. The latter also show a hierarchical structure – and are strictly integrated and despotic totalities but the ascent of their functionaries to the upper grade has nothing to do with any quality of theirs with regard to an objective spiritual content but almost exclusively with their ability to impose on people, to handle people, to be clever with people. Purely administrative and technical qualities define the human forces governing modern totalities. Such traits were by no means lacking in leaders of the different sectors of ancient classes, but by their radical separation from any autonomous idea. These traits give the modern totality its particular character.</p> <p>The concept of labor as a pragmatic totality becomes quite clear when compared with the proletariat as conceived by Marx. For him, the workers were the masses of all exploited people in industrialist society. In spite of all the minor differences of their individual fates, each of them, on the whole, had the same outlook on life: periods of employment would become shorter, the pressure of the “reserve army” on wages grow stronger, and misery, in the midst of an ever wealthier society, become unbearable. Marxian theory predicted that the capitalists would become less and less able to grant even a bare existence to the majority of the population. This trend would be expressed in the life of the average worker by a decay of his whole situation, by a deepening of his poverty, by growing hopelessness and despair. The economic pressure resulting from this state of affairs, together with the enlightenment of the workers achieved by their role in the modern productive process, would lead the formation of a party which would finally change the world. This party would spring from the similarity of the conditions of the workers all over the world. Its principles and structure would not be so much concerned with the temporary differences in their financial situation in various branches of production or various geographical and national settings. It would not express so much the actual conscience of the individual worker as affected by all the mutilating influences of exploitation. Essentially, it would embody the resistance against the frustrations imposed upon man by social forms which had become purely oppressive. It would not be based upon psychological factors but upon the objective tendency of the economic system. The efforts of this party would be inspired by the fulfillment of just those human aspirations, material and spiritual, which were suppressed and distorted by the modern industrial process which has made the individual a kind of accessory to machinery. The party’s aims were to be connected with the plight of the individual and the masses, and had no special affinity to any particular category of workers at the expense of others. It represented the oppressed masses as a whole. Since the reason for the laborer’s frustrations was not considered to be found in any specific defect of capitalism but in the very principle of class-rule, the efforts of the workers’ party were to be guided at each stage by the objective idea of abolishing that rule and the establishing of true community.</p> <p>This plan, however, was burdened from the very beginning of labor movements with an intrinsic difficulty. While the workers had to bear the full pressure of this society, whose tendency was to keep them below the minimum standard of living, they had to struggle daily in order to keep themselves alive. This meant that they kept alive a society whose rulers became stronger and stronger through the appropriated labor of the proletariat. Thus, the concept of class struggle always had these two connotations: the abolition of the wage system as such, and the attainment of higher wages within that system. It was the latter down-to-earth activity which once was conceived as the necessary stepping stone to revolution, as, for instance, through the general strike. The obsolescence of the latter idea is only one symptom of the fundamental change that has occurred. The class struggle has been transformed into a system of trade between monopolistic units, into a means of class adaptation, and into wars. Formerly, the relationship between daily struggle and revolutionary aim determined the whole labor movement, at least in continental Europe. Critical theory decided which way was to be taken in each situation. However, the struggling class was never “integrated” into one more competitor in the hunt for surplus value. The party was decidedly not concerned with the increase of its members’ incomes, nor the income or career or social position of its leaders. Working for and even adhering to that party meant the renunciation of all such things. Party members were an avant-garde of the working class for the very reason that such principles could be understood and assimilated only by relatively advanced elements of the working class. They were supposed to control the leaders very closely, and the criterion of that control was supposed to be not the avant-garde’s own wishes and needs, but the common interest of the working class in all countries, as the avant-garde was able to understand it. The tremendous majority of the proletariat was composed of individuals who, in their own psychology, expressed the mutilating effect of exploitation rather than the idea of a free humanity. The party, in spite of, even because of its antagonism to the majority of the masses represented, thought of itself as the genuine conscience of that same majority. Because the masses were unable to concretize their true interests, the party, in its decisions, had to rely on the theory of capitalistic society.</p> <p>Social theory was the heir to the older systems of thought which were supposed to have set the rules for past totalities. These older systems had vanished because the prevailing forms of solidarity proclaimed by them had proven to be treacherous. Unlike the medieval doctrine of the church or the liberalistic apology of the market system, proletarian theory of capitalism did not glorify its subject. It looked upon capitalism as the final form of domination. In no way did it justify the established ideas and superstitions of those whom it guided. In contrast to the tendencies of today’s mass culture, it did not sell the people their own way of living, which they unconsciously abhorred, but overtly acclaimed. Proletarian theory was the critical analysis of reality including the worker’s own warped thoughts. The locus of theory was the difference between the objective interest of the exploited class and the immediate interest of the individual workers: The more this difference is obscured by the existing social set-up, the more theory tends to vanish. Even when the actual masses were hostile to the party, they felt its theory linked them with their own ultimate interests. The party was not above the masses as the labor-leaders of today are above the laborers whom they integrate into their organizational patterns. The proletariat itself remained somewhat amorphous and chaotic, composed of individual subjects. Although deprived as they were of their human qualities by being transformed into mere elements of production, they had not yet become statistical figures of organizations. The character of the individual was not quite replaced by that of the member, defined exclusively by its standardized interests. Around the middle of the 19th century, the non-integrated nature of the individual worker as a part of an amorphous proletariat of the disinherited peasant or artisan, and his retrogressiveness in terms of the ever increasing rational “socialization” (<em>Vergesellschaftung</em>) of society was inseparably bound up with his “progressiveness” in the sense of revolution. [It is significant that, even today, worker’s organizations which are with some justification labeled as “backward” both theoretically and economically have proven to be the most spontaneous elements in critical situations, such as the Spanish Civil War.]<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p> <p>However, the clock cannot be put back nor can the organizational development be revoked or even theoretically rejected. The hope of the proletariat today does not consist of sticking to traditional party and civil war patterns. Rather, it must recognize and fight the monopolistic set-up of society infiltrating into the proletariat’s own organizations and infesting the minds of its individuals. In the 19th century concept of a future rational society the traits which expressed the planning, organizing, and centralizing functions in opposition to “chaotic” liberalistic economy prevailed over the traits expressing the plight of the individual. The workers’ parliamentary parties, which themselves were a product of liberalism and denounced liberalistic irrationality and promoted socialist economy in opposition to an anarchic capitalism. Under monopolism the other side of rationality has become manifest by its increasing suppression: the participation of all in the shaping of social life, equal chance to develop one’s own potentialities, equal security for all. Together with the rationalization of production, the idea of democracy calls for laying aside all fenced off economic positions, for establishing a world free from monopolies. The amorphism, by which the proletariat in the era of Marx and Engels differed fundamentally from any kind of totality, was the reason why, despite its being split into national groups, skilled and unskilled labor, employed and unemployed, its interests could become crystallized in a body such as the party. The trade union, though its role was not to be underestimated, had to subordinate its actions to the party’s strategy. The amorphism of the masses and its complement, theoretical thinking, both expressed in the party’s fight against exploitation as such, formed the contrast to the pragmatic totalities of today. The rise of workers from a passive role in the capitalistic process has been paid for with their complete integration.</p> <p>Labor in monopolistic society is itself a kind of monopoly: to be more exact, it is the monopoly of its leaders. [There are some decisive differences between Labor and capitalistic monopolies. The most important arises from the fact that each capitalistic monopoly constitutes some kind of economic unity which tries to appropriate as much surplus value as possible. The term Labor, however, comprises both the leaders who appropriate the profits and the members who create them. The same process which, both in reality and ideology, has made Labor an economic subject, has transformed the laborer, who was already the object of the entrepreneur, into the object of his organization as well. At the same time that ideology has become more realistic, more down-to-earth, its inherent contradiction to reality, its absurdity, has increased. While the masses think of themselves as the creators of their own destiny, the leaders use them as a commodity. The fact that Labor is a monopoly does not mean that its members, labor aristocracy excepted, are monopolists. It does mean that]<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> the leaders control labor supplies as the presidents of the big corporations control raw materials, machines, or other elements of production. Labor leaders trade on this kind of merchandise, manipulate it, advertise it, and try to fix its price as high as possible. Labor, becoming a trade among others, completes the process of the reification of the human mind. A man’s productive power today is not only bought by the factory and subordinated to the requirements of technology but rationed and managed by superior agencies of the Labor Movement. It is a double-barrelled transformation into things. With religious and moral ideologies fading and proletarian theory being abolished by the march of economic and political events,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> the conscience of the workers tends to become identical with the categories of their leaders’ trade. The idea of intrinsic antagonism between the international proletariat and any system of domination is completely superseded by the concepts connected with the disputes of power between the various monopolies. True, the proletarians of older days did not have any conceptual knowledge of the social mechanisms unveiled by theory, and their minds and souls bore the hallmarks of oppression. Yet, their misery was still the misery of single human beings and therefore connected them with any exploited mass in any country and in any sector of society. Their undeveloped minds were not kept in movement by the techniques of modern mass culture hammering the behavior patterns prevalent under monopolism into their eyes and ears and muscles during leisure time as well as during working hours (from which the so-called amusement period can hardly be differentiated anyway). Workers today as well as the public in general are intellectually better trained, better informed, and much less naive. They know the details of national affairs, and the tricks and crooked means typical of political movements, particularly of those which live from propaganda against corruption. The workers, at least those who have not gone through the hell of Fascism, will join in any persecution of a capitalist or politician who has been singled out because he violated the rules; but they do not question the rules themselves. They have learned to take the basic injustice of class society as a powerful fact and to take powerful facts as the only thing to be respected. Their minds are closed to dreams of a basically different world and to concepts which instead of being mere classifications of facts are formed under the aspect of real fulfillment of those dreams. Their childish belief in such things has been so drastically wiped out of their memory that now they stubbornly believe in reality as it is. Desperately, they repeat the commands which are knocked into the children’s systems when they try to open their eyes: there is only one way to live and that is the actual one, the one of hardboiled smartness; the things that seemed to be opposed to it are idle slogans, lies, metaphysics; he who is unable to adapt himself to this state of affairs, whether oneself or any other man, the badly adjusted, stupid one, is rightly doomed. Modern economic conditions make for a positivistic attitude in members as well as in leaders, in that they resemble each other more and more. [Such a transformation, although constantly challenged by tendencies in the opposite direction, strengthens Labor as a new force in social life.]<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p> <p>Not that inequality has decreased. Even statistics cannot hide the fact that the gap between the social power of a single worker and that of a single corporation president has widened and this difference is the real yardstick as far as social justice is concerned. And, while the unions, dealing in certain categories of labor, have been able to raise their prices, the whole weight of society is felt by other categories, organized or unorganized. There is, furthermore, the cleavage between members of unions and those who cannot afford to enter in them, between the members of privileged nations and those who, in this smaller-growing world, are exploited, not only by their own traditional elites, but also through the medium of these elites, by the ruling groups of the industrially more developed countries. The principle of exploitation has not changed at all. Marx’s prediction that private competitive industry would become increasingly unable to employ the bulk of the proletariat as wage earners in the production of consumer goods or machines for consumer goods has come true. As a consequence, the association of the masses against universal exploitation has been made even more difficult by the appearance of new antagonisms within the ranks of the oppressed masses themselves. The opposing interests of farmers and workers, colored and white labor, soldiers and civilians are complicated by those of the various categories of the employed. Since it is the trend of capitalistic society that ever greater parts of the middle classes lose their economic independence. This process engulfs almost the whole population. It forms a complement to the emancipation of large masses from economic stagnation and pauperization. The more the world becomes ripe for the realization of theoretical thought, the more theoretical thought and every human trait which points to it seem to vanish, and, wherever they become manifest, are wiped out pitilessly by ideological control mechanisms serving the monopolies both of Industry and of Labor. The conscious precautions taken by radio, press, and motion pictures are only a visible supplement to the unconscious trends necessitated by economic and social development. The persecution of any independent social thought represents none of the groups struggling for a greater share of power, and has no usefulness for any prevailing interest, is not only planned and practiced by the agencies of culture but takes place within each member of society. [There are however, some centers of resistance left within man. It is a counter-evidence against social pessimism that notwithstanding the continuous assault by collective patterns humanity is still alive, if not in the individual as a member of social groups at least in the individual as far as he is left alone.]<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p> <p>The power of collective patterns of monopolistic society goes far beyond the sphere of conscious influence. From the day of his birth, the individual is made to feel that there is only one way to get along in this world: by resigning his unlimited hope. This he can only achieve by imitation (<em>mimesis</em>). He continuously ruminates what he perceives around him not only consciously – he acquires judgment and notions much later – but with his whole being. Long before he can even speak, he echoes the gestures of the persons and things around him. Later on, he echoes the traits and attitudes of all the collectives at whose mercy he is: his family, his classmates, his athletic team and all the other teams which enforce a deeper conformity, a more radical surrender by complete assimilation than any father or teacher in the 19th century. By echoing, repeating, imitating the surroundings, by adapting himself to all the powerful groups to which he belongs, by transforming himself from a human being into a member of specific organized bodies, by reducing his potentialities to readiness and ability to conform to, and gain influence in, such bodies, he can finally manage to survive. It is survival by practicing the oldest biological means of survival: mimicry. Modern culture is a resurrection of oppressed mimetic practices. Just as the child repeats the words of his mother and the youngster, the brutality of his elders at whose hands he has suffered much, industrialized culture, the giant loudspeaker voice of monopolism, copies reality endlessly and boringly. All the ingenious devices of the amusement industry serve but to reproduce over and over again, without betraying the slightest revolt, scenes of life which are already dull and automatized when they happen in reality. Motion pictures, radio, popular biographies and novels shout incessantly the same rhythm: this is our groove, this is the rut of the great and the little ones, this is reality as it is and should be and will be. Even the words which could express a hope for something else than the fruits of success have been absorbed. On the one hand, beatitude – and everything which refers to the absolute – has been assimilated by confining the idea to religious edification as a leisure time function; it has become part of Sunday School vernacular. Happiness, on the other hand, has come to mean exactly the normal life of which thought, even religious thought, at certain times, contained a radical criticism. Language has been so thoroughly reduced to the function ascribed to it in positivistic theory; it has become just another tool in the giant apparatus of production in monopolistic society. Every sentence which is not equivalent to an operation in that apparatus appears to the layman just as meaningless as it is decried to be by contemporary semantics, whose doctrine actually implies that only the purely symbolic and the operational, that is, the purely senseless sentence makes sense. Under the pressure of the pragmatic totalities of today, man’s self-expression has become identical with his function in the prevailing system. Within himself as well as in others, man desperately represses any other impulse. Wherever he perceives an unadjusted longing, he feels an overwhelming wrath and fury, an utter rage which crashes down on everybody and everything which, by exhibiting the idea of complete fulfillment, forces him to curb and repress the longing anew. [It is just this spitefulness which indicates that humanity has not been completely absorbed by the repressive collectivization of man. It has a disquieting aspect for the rulers. In spite of their social and psychological victories, they sense that their hold over the masses is in jeopardy. This is why terror has to implement collectivization.]<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p> <p>In the earlier periods of bourgeois society as well as in the history of other forms of society, there existed a greater multitude of independent economic subjects who took care of their own individual property and maintained it against competitive social forces. Such times necessitated the fostering of relatively independent thought which by its very nature, its “objectivity,” is related to the interests of humanity. Against its own wishes, the society of middle class proprietors and, particularly, the professions related to the now-vanishing economic sphere of [distribution],<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> had to promote thinking which, whether they liked it or not, was antagonistic to class rule and domination. Today the individual in the course of his economic functions is never directly confronted with society. It is always his group, his association, his union, which takes care of his rights.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Therefore the very category of the individual, with its good and bad implications, is in a state of liquidation. Thought, unrelated to the interest of any established group, unrelated to the business of any industry, has lost its significance. It is considered vain and empty. That self same society which, in the fact of hunger and starvation in great areas of the world, leaves a considerable part of its machinery idle, that society which suppresses or shelves important inventions, and which, in the rare periods of full employment, devotes a tremendous part of its working hours to idiotic advertisements (for even what is left of culture boils itself down to advertisements and propaganda) or to the production of instruments of destruction, that self-same society to which these sinister luxuries are inherent, has made usefulness its gospel. Conversely it has stamped the only ultimate aim for which civilization could be useful, a luxury: truth as it envisages the realization of humanity instead of the domination of nature.</p> <p>However, the difference of the actual situation from other chapters of history should not be exaggerated. In the earlier periods mentioned above, the existence of independent thought in the middle classes was paid for by the miserable material condition of the working class even in the most highly developed countries. The revolutionary thinkers of the proletariat came from the middle- or upper-classes. Since that time, the working class as a whole has made tremendous progress. Its rationality, at least as far as it is able to express itself, is purely pragmatic, and therefore “particularistic,” like that of the rest of society; but the tremendous physical, organizational, and cultural pressure which is necessary to keep it in this state, the increased furor with which not only every trace of independent political practice but the expression of any independent thought or even the mere suspicion of the existence of such thought are hated and eventually persecuted, the hectic strengthening of all reactionary organizations and movements, betray the rising fear of the abolition of fear and repression. The feverish attempt to channel the ever greater fury which develops in the masses due to the necessity of repressing their own original longings, and to prevent that furor from being conquered by eventual insight into the ever increasing senselessness of that repression and into the real identity of human interests. Such channeling which has always been the business of the rulers, of their cultural and terroristic apparatus, has also become the business of labor organizations which, at the same time, lead labor into the struggle of competition and increase its strength. [The antagonism between the classes is reproduced within the structure of labor and especially within the labor unions themselves – although it is perhaps better veiled there than it ever has been in society as a whole. Docilely and without a hint of any opposing interests, the workers surrender part of their money to the mammoth trusts which trade in their labor.]<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p> <p>It is not so much the amount of the contributions which makes the labor leaders a kind of group of the ruling class, but the social control exercised by them on the basis of these contributions. Certainly a great part of their material interests is opposed to the interests of other competing groups but this holds true for all groups which have ever formed the ruling class: they all have fought each other. Their affinity springs from the source of their income. They all live on what they can grasp from the circulating surplus value. This also goes for the industrialist himself. The working hours under which his immediate supervision are spent on the production of surplus value do not correspond to the share he himself gets of the whole surplus value at the disposition of the ruling class. He receives his proof not as an industrialist but as a businessman; as such he has to compete with others in order to get as large an amount as possible out of the entire result of each production period. He is in the same position as those capitalists whose business is not directly productive, like the bankers, the entrepreneurs in the communications- or entertainment-industries, and all the liberal professions and activities [which are exercised by so-called ‘third persons.’]<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> All of them have to develop their skill of shrewd calculation, of not giving away everything without getting as much as possible in return, of becoming acceptable to stronger groups, of using their fellowman exclusively as a tool for strengthening their grip on society. This skill is not derived from conscious determination. People are determined to assume such an attitude towards life but awareness of their willingness stirs up counter-trends in their own minds and in the minds of the people upon whom they want to impose. The qualities necessary for ascent spring from the unconscious; they have become second nature in man. Be that as it may, these psychological qualities are indispensable. The liberalistic ideology that a man’s fate depends on the economic significance of his activity demands two corrections. First, economic significance in this society means usefulness not with regard to the needs of all but with regard to essential conditions of the hierarchy of power. In order to be allowed to live, the individual must prove his value to some of the groups which are engaged in their struggle for a greater share of control over national and international economy. Second, the quantity and quality of goods or services which an individual contributes to the wealth of society is but one of the factors which determine his success.</p> <p>The more the economy is rationalized the more obvious it becomes that the differences of intelligence needed for the various functions could easily be overcome by adequate training. Under such conditions adaptability to the prevailing power relations rather than any other personal trait becomes paramount. It has been the fallacy of technocratic thinking from St. Simon to Veblen to underestimate the similarity of promising character traits in the different branches of production and of business and to confound rational use of the means of production with rational inclinations of certain categories of its agents.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> The engineer, indeed, embodies progress. He looks at people not exclusively as means of profit-making. His function as commander is more directly linked to the requirements of the work itself; therefore, his orders bear on the signs of greater objectivity. His subordinates recognize at least part of his commands as founded in the nature of things and therefore rational in a universal sense. But even the essence of this rationality is not reason but domination. The engineer’s understanding of things regards none of their elements by which they can be handled and transformed – their weakest points, so to speak. He is not interested in things as they really are but as they can be fitted into schema completely alien to their own nature. In fact his methods of thinking, his categories, lead necessarily to the triumph of modern technology: the smashing of atoms. No one is considered as an aim, all are mere tools. His mind is that of class society in its streamlined form, without any ornaments. His purposeful rule would make humanity a mass of utopia without any purpose.</p> <p>The labor leaders have become an acquisitive group among others. The conditions under which they work are more difficult. It is not so easy for them as for the leaders of the big capitalist trusts to keep their doings from discussion by a public opinion which in the last analysis is controlled by the entrepreneurs. [The large masses of members with whom the labor magnates have to deal, plus certain basically democratic patterns inherent in all non-fascist labor organizations, do not allow for the same conspiratory techniques which have been employed so successfully by big business in all its national and international undertakings. This is why the labor bureaucracy tries to dispense with membership meetings as much as possible. Every ruling minority needs secrecy as a condition of its perpetuation. Despite all these essential differences, however, the similarity between the organized totality of Labor and other monopolies should not be underrated.]<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>Each of the capitalist, professional and labor groups exercise specific functions in the social process and each uses that function to get as large a share of power over men, goods and services as possible. There have been, throughout history, diverse methods employed in this struggle: competition, swindles, robbery, war. This struggle which, as pointed out in the beginning, characterizes the set-up of each ruling class as definitely in its role in production, has become a trait of the labor groups today. Although labor leaders cannot achieve any results without obtaining, at least temporarily, some advantages for the workers. But their own social and economic power, their own position and income (all these factors overwhelmingly superior to the power, position, and income of the individual worker) depend on the maintenance of capitalism. This economic fact holds true despite the great services they may render to their respective memberships. The entrepreneur’s activities too very often had a positive effect on the income of labor; higher incomes of the entrepreneurs are no more opposed to the interests of labor than higher incomes of the labor leaders. But there is now a new kind of solidarity between the old and the new elites; social history during the last decades has brought closer cooperation between them. The attitude of the great labor unions towards the State in the last several decades was similar to that of the big capitalistic organizations. They were concerned with preventing the government from mingling in their affairs. “No interference with or without our private business” was their doctrine.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> [It was the “<em>Herr im Hause</em>” standpoint.]<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> [In the meantime the increasing economic power of monopolies has made understanding the central government imperative for labor leaders, and the same understanding is important for the government.]<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> The integration of cooperative elements into the administration has made progress during the war. Society becomes a planned and regulated process, not with regard to great events (they still depend on blind forces resulting from the struggle between the classes and among the various ruling groups), but as far as the life of the individual is concerned; not in the sense of self-administration (the decisions are made as compromises among the prominent whose interests do not correspond to those of the rest of society) but with regard to a more streamlined performance of the material and human apparatus of production.</p> <p>It is possible that once the strongest capitalistic groups gain direct control of the state, the labor bureaucracy will be abolished as well as the governmental one, and be replaced by more dependable commissioners of big business. Although this could be achieved without a formal change of constitutional principles, it would mean a development similar to that in Germany. It is also possible that labor in its actual structure will acquire an even stronger portion of the set-up to come. In both cases the material condition of labor may temporarily improve in the ruler states of the future at the expense of the vanquished as well as the vassal nations but at the same time the gap between the significance of a single member and of the prominent functionaries will deepen, the impotence of the human individual will become more marked, and the differences in wage according to sex, age, industrial and race groups will increase. This will bring about the triumph of particularistic rationality within the workers and their complete disillusionment. They will fit even more completely into the system and, at the same time, become more obstinate against its exacting requirements. Concomitant with all the labor saving devices, which the workers expertly enjoy, is an ever-increasing personal discontent and an economical attitude towards any expenditure of labor power. No one wants to be a sucker. True, the technological process has not made the workers revolutionary but refractory, insubordinate, difficult to handle. While formerly the ruling class could use sweeping ideologies which were good enough for the whole population, monopolism has had to develop quite a science of Personnel Management. Big plants today keep specialists who cater to the personal problems of the single worker. They adapt the smartest techniques, such as resort places, abridged psycho-analysis, and Tschaikowskij symphonies over loudspeakers during working hours. All this accompanies an unabated terror against anyone who seriously opposes the system as such. Workers become a more and more disquieting factor within the whole setup of Monopolism by their very assimilation to its material and cultural patterns. They threaten to gain what this period destroys, namely, in individuality. Therefore capitalism itself tends to promote pseudo-collectivistic social patterns and fascist forms of government.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p> <p>Gradual abolishment of the market as a regulator of production is a symptom of the vanishing influence of anything outside the decisive groups.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> True, the needs which, in the market system, made themselves felt in a most distorted anonymous and irrational form, can now be determined by statistics and be satisfied or rejected in accordance with the policy of the rulers. But if this new rationality is in one way closer to the idea of reason than the market system, it is in another way farther from it. Dealings between the ruling and the ruled were really determined not by the market but by the unequal distribution of power as it was expressed in the property of the means of production; yet the transformation of human relations into objective economic mechanisms granted the individual, at least in principle, a certain independence; domination was humanized by dehumanized, that is to say, intermediary, spheres. Today the expression of human needs is distorted no longer by the dubious economic indicators of the market, but by their conscious molding in a giant system of socio-psychological surgery. The misery of unsuccessful competitors and of backward groups can no longer be ascribed to anonymous processes which permitted a distinction between them as economic subjects and as human beings. The downfall of vanquished opponents, competitors as well as whole social strata, minorities and nations, is decided upon by the elites. Those who are to suffer are singled out and called by their names. However, the insidious policies of economic leaders today are as private and particularistic, and therefore perhaps even blinder with regard to the real needs of society, than the automatic trends which once determined the market. It is still irrationality which shapes the fate of humans. This does not mean that reason is not maintained by any individuals or groups at all. There are more people today who have real insight into the economic situation and its potentialities than at any other period. Their chances seem to have improved by the progress of methods of production, communication, and planning, and by the decomposition of all kinds of superstitions. Actually, the positions of thought have deteriorated by the perfection of the methods of domination, by the extinction of theoretical thought and by the new and stronger taboos resulting from the pseudo enlightened philosophy of [pragmatism, which expresses the abandoning of unintegrated thought.]<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p> <p>Under monopolism and totalitarianism the perennial nature of domination, its parasitic character, becomes blatant. Each ruling class has always been monopolistic in so far as it has fenced itself off from the overwhelming majority of individuals. The structure has been that of competing rackets. Even the socially expedient functions which the ruling classes have fulfilled, have been turned into weapons against the underlying population and against the competing groups of their own class. The racket-pattern which has been typical of the behavior of the rulers toward the ruled is now representative of all human relations, even those within Labor.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p> <p>The similarity of the most respectable historical entities as, for instance, the hierarchies of the Middle Ages, to modern rackets, is obvious. The concept of racket therefore refers to the big as well as to the small units; they all struggle for as great a share as possible of the surplus value. In this respect the highest capitalistic bodies resemble the little pressure groups working within or without the pale of the law among the most miserable strata of the population. Emphasis is to be laid on the fact that the role of a group in production though determining to a great extent its share of consumption, has been in class society a good strategic position for grasping as much goods and services as possible in the sphere of distribution. This is particularly the case in periods when the mode of production to which its leaders stick so tenaciously has become obsolete. They make use of their productive apparatus as robbers make use of their guns. What the petty illegal racket has been to the particular branch of business which it “protected” and fleeced, the class, which constitutes the total of its under-rackets, has been so society as a whole. In the contemporary slang-use of rackets as an equivalent for any profitable job there may be no conscious thought of these implications. But objectively, such use of the term expresses the idea that in present-day society every activity, whatever it may be, has as its content and goal no interest other than the acquisition of as large a part as possible of the circulating surplus value. The attempt to monopolize an economic function, is for the sake neither of production nor satisfaction of needs. The label of “unproductivity” used against all sorts of activities and even against whole groups belies the constant fear that anything one does may be useless, seems to originate in an unconscious fear that all the hectic activity in this pragmatic society is labor of Sisyphus. Industry overcomes its own awareness and society’s realization that production is a mere stronghold in the fight for prey by adopting production as a kind of religious creed, by promoting technocratic ideas and attaching the “unproductive” label to other groups, which do not even have an access to the big industrial bastions. It is a mechanism similar to the one which produced the terroristic rackets in 16th and 17th century Europe, which killed hundreds of thousands of unfortunates and wiped out the female population of whole counties for their alleged intercourse with Satan. These torturing, murderous, predatory rackets exalted all the more fervently the tortured, murdered, robbed God on the cross, and adored all the more devoutly the Virgin for her conception through the holy spirit. Today the rackets propagate productivity and common spirit, persecute as “racket” each person or group which refuses to join them, and as destructive, each undertaking which tries to put an end to destruction. Those who accomplish repression by an ocean of spoken and written words watch jealously, lest a single “unrelated” sentence be heard.</p> <p>A true sociology of the racket as the living [element]<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> of the ruling class in history could serve both a political and a scientific purpose. It could help clarify the goal of political practice: a society whose pattern is different from that of the racket, a racketless society. It could serve to define the idea of Democracy which still leads an underground existence in the minds of individuals. Today rackets have adapted this idea to their economic and political practices. They have slyly formalized political concepts and thus made expert political cliques dominating whole groups and states into champions of Democracy. Conversely they brand humanist theoreticians as advocates of dictatorship, for they have tried to promote and practice, no matter how inadequately, democratic contents. Despite all this, the meaning of Democracy, deeply connected with that of truth, is not forgotten. It needs to be expressed against a world which is more repressive and hostile than ever and against the shrewdest tactics of stupidity. Scientifically the sociology of the racket could yield a more adequate philosophy of history. Moreover, it could help throw more light upon many issues in the realm of humanities, even upon such remote and controversial problems as the initiation rites and patriarchal rackets of magicians in primitive tribes. It would show that the “breaking” of young men at the occasion of their entrance into such tribes represented acceptance, not as much into the community as such as into a particularistic social totality. Very similar observations can be made with regard to the relation of adults and children through the Middle Ages up to the beginnings of the 19th century. Adults, with regard to the children, behaved as a totality. The racket was also the pattern of the organization of males with regard to females. The modern concept serves to describe past social relations. “The anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the monkey.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <p><br/></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>(Editor’s note:) Replaced by “materialist theory of history” in (1a) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>(Editor’s note:) Horkheimer’s substitution in (1a): “Marx has pointed out both the positive and the negative aspects of competition, (…)” <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>(Editor’s note:) (1a): “accuse” (handwritten insertion) <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>(Horkheimer’s footnote:) The term “totality” in the above sense of an organized structure will be so employed throughout this discussion. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:5"> <p>(Editor’s note:) From version in (1c), crossed out in (1b) and (1a).

The concept of class in its universal aspect, as typical for social theory, played an essential role in American sociology when it was young. Later on, emphasis was laid upon investigations in the light of which such concepts appear increasingly metaphysical. In our opinion the basis of this development is to be sought rather in the social process, to which we refer, than in the process of science itself. The time when sociology believed in its “larger task of constructing theoretical systems of social structure and social change,” the period before the first world war, was marked “by the general belief that theoretical sociology would somehow play a major constructive role in the progressive development of our society; sociology had the grandiose ambitions of youth.” (Charles H. Page, <em>Class and American Sociology</em>, New York 1940, p. 249). By this time its ambitions are certainly different.

The various laws resulting in the abolition of this right ratified the verdict against the existence of the independent economic subject. They put the dot on the ‘i’ of all trends and which abolished the liberal world. Gold in private possession for the owner provided a certain protection against the vacillations of the economy. Even modest property, guaranteed within certain limits, a life which was not entirely absorbed by participation in the economic process. The relative stability of the value of that particular merchandise endowed its owner with a force of resistance against his complete integration into the social mechanism, this resistance expressed itself in a certain degree of autonomy by which bourgeois culture was characterized. The more or less independent position of money for gold showed in his own mentality as well as in his literature and art. Culture obeyed its own laws to a certain extent and contained a criticism not only with regard to specific and concrete points of reality but also of its basic structure. Gold within the reach of any economic subject made the bourgeois individual somehow the successor of the aristocrat. The bourgeois could provide security for himself and make reasonably sure that even after his death his dependents would not have to submit totally to society. This freedom on the one hand excluded the masses, but, on the other hand, created cultural forms opposing this same exclusiveness. Today, no one can expect to find a place to lead a life of his own. He has to surrender completely: not to human solidarity but to the social process of monopoly. There are no safety-zones on the thoroughfare of society. Everyone must keep moving. Monopolism does not tolerate the beggar. But the beggar, whom the <em>Rentier</em> had always wanted to see removed from the streets, takes him along to the realm of the anguished. [*] Exemption from work, “privacy” voluntary or involuntary, bore witness to the existence of a non-totalitarian order. Gold in private possession was the sign of bourgeois rule. Its transfer to the state is the sign of monopoly.

What was already clear to everyone except for the professors in the times of so-called liberalism—namely, that the words ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ concealed the true cause of economic processes—has now dawned on them as well, for a simple reason. Whereas in earlier times, those concepts directly stood in for wealth management, profiteering, and exploitation, today the state, with which its sponsors are not in complete agreement for the time being, is recognized as the mediator between these factors and fluctuations in supply and demand. Now, just as the government has been found behind the veil of economics [<em>ökonomischen</em> <em>Schleier</em>] instead of naked relations of exploitation, economists declare the laws of the market have been replaced by historical, political, and psychological laws instead. They’ve taken this into account in actuality as well. The progressives and reformists among them move on to the late-democratic administrations which, on the grounds of the incompatibility of capitalism and concrete democracy, are increasingly isolated, increasingly powerless bureaucracies and, ultimately, replaced by ruling agencies [<em>Herrschaftsinstanzen</em>] more adequate to monopoly. The more fortunate majority of economic experts, even when they collaborate with wartime administrations, hold themselves back in reserve until the bright capitalist sun breaks through the clouds once more.</p> <p>However, the concept of economy they have declared obsolete is now more real than ever before. They were already disavowing it when there were still openings for professorships in economic theory. Only, in those days it was not done by liquidation of the word itself, but by its false substitution with so-called ‘national economy.’ Instead of getting to the bottom of the mode by which society produces and reproduces its material life, they investigated price-formation, economic cycles, and fluctuations of the stock market in a vacuum. Even then, out of embarrassment, they dismissed any considerations of the data which might bring out the connection between the transactions of the entrepreneur to actual power-relations as ‘extra-economic’; now, all of a sudden, the ultimate cause [<em>die Endursache</em>] is supposed to be the real confrontation between state power and national and international factors. But just as ‘national economy’ once veiled economic reality by hypostasizing market processes, now the increase of concentration on politics—or, at best, on technology—effectively prevents cognition of the facts of the matter. This is the regression of bourgeois theory to its early stages, to Cardano and Machiavelli. The regression, however, is not the repetition but the distortion of the original state of affairs. [The rediscovery of politics, which in the Renaissance was a theoretical advance, has become in thinking under monopoly a category more ideological than the laws of the market were under liberalism: with its help, the surface is hypostasized. The dominated masses attribute world events to politics—hearing only appeal and degree, keeping themselves informed about the lives of the high and mighty, facts which need no theory. The masses experience the immediate consequences of political acts, of negotiations of rackets; they feel the effects of the emergency assistance, the inflation, the new job, the war and take big politics for fate and nature just as they once did the economic depression. And each of the protagonists shares in this belief: they know they hold a key position. Just as the entrepreneur confused his business ventures undertaken on the basis of economic cycles, his calculations and his speculations, with freedom, the presidents of trade unions and governments mistake their decisions for initiation of causal chains.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Governing, however, must defer to the same necessities as asset management: to the requirements of the reproduction of society in the form of power relations as they are. In this, there is little difference between the two periods. The unsurveyability of the market from which the self-deception of freedom arose had only expressed the fact that the relationships between entrepreneurs amongst themselves were not rational, but relationships of individual self-assertion. Today the struggles take place in much stronger groups, amongst the movements of the most concentrated masses of capital. The governments are executive apparatuses which cannot rationally penetrate the current balance of forces on which they depend, but feel their effects concretely.] They would be free, if…<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p> <h2 id="rackets-and-spirit-194244">Rackets and Spirit (1942/44)</h2> <p>The basic form of domination is the racket.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> It is possible, as some have assumed, that a single tyrant directed and protected the whole of the primal horde, but even in this case the gradation of strength between him and the weakest member of the horde establishes a hierarchy.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The next-strongest of the men guard their privileges over their lessers just as the patriarch guards his own over them. With the invention of tools, the order of rank is no longer determined by physical force alone, but just as much by the way of life prescribed to human beings by the nature of their tools. Better weapons, methods for cultivating the soil, in combination with a more suitable condition of the land, make a more abundant existence possible. Once a new stage is reached, regression into an earlier one is prevented not merely by new habits and needs in general, but also by the splitting of interests established on the basis of new methods. Unique requirements and the skills which correspond to them are formed and developed by certain individuals and groups, in opposition to the rest of society according to the positions they hold in the new division of labor. Through these abilities, the occupation of key positions in the social apparatus, the hierarchy of power, originally and exclusively grounded on natural potencies, undergoes modification until, in the course of social development, hierarchy ultimately corresponds to second, social nature—no longer to strength, but position. That first nature upon which society is grounded still is mutilated and enslaved.</p> <p>The divorce of above from below, dominators from dominated, rests on the organization of each individual power-group in itself and its opposition to those below it. Towards the top, each group is relatively amorphous, since, in the long run, their form of organization is molded by the strenuous effort not to slide towards the bottom. Organizations with the tips of their spears pointed upwards have no place in the established hierarchy, are without regular economic function, and, after periods of illegality, are brought back to life in revolutionary actions. In history thus far, whenever such undertakings were victorious, groups of functionaries and their clients replaced them in the modified hierarchy and hardened themselves downwards. These groups maintain their social function or adopt a new one, which, from then on, they monopolize. ‘Hardening’ means monopolizing the advantages which can be extorted on the grounds of a determinate, regular performance within the social process. One such hardening of a function—which would prove decisive—was private ownership of the means of production, namely the command over commodity-production in the age of industrialization.</p> <p>The most general category of group-executed functions is that of protection. Groups maintain the conditions for the continuation of the division of labor in which they have preferential standing, upholding their monopoly and warding off the changes which might endanger it. They are rackets. In each case, ‘ruling class’ means the structure of rackets on the grounds of a determinate mode of production, so far as they simultaneously protect and suppress the undermost strata. They may also be split amongst themselves according to the economic dynamics that shape their material interests; indeed, they may, consciously or unconsciously, perpetuate and even intensify the splitting so far as their protective functions are strengthened in the process. The relation of the ruling class to the unification of domination has always been a complicated one. The ambivalent relationship between the powers of empire and papacy in the joint suppression of centrifugal forces through the middle ages was more advantageous for each than the fusion of the two powers would have been. Even the maintenance of the nation-states only served a part of the special interests of the national bureaucracy, but to the benefit of the system of rackets as a whole.</p> <p>The downwards-hardening of rackets is identical with the hardening of the individuals who constitute them, something which has been consciously pursued throughout the whole of history. For the sake of one’s own children, this is what their education consisted of. Only in the liberalistic periods, in which a certain sector of rackets couldn’t be totally devoid of more obliging qualities for economic reasons, did [education] take on humane features. Prior to this, [education] was as cruel as the initiation-rites of the primitive tribe, which was already a racket itself. For individuals who lacked a rightful claim on the grounds of their descent to be integrated into a racket, the procedure was not like the incorporation of the youth into their own tribe, but rather like their consecration into the elect racket of the sorcerers. This demands the complete breaking of one’s personality, absolutely binding guarantees of one’s future faithfulness. The individual must relinquish all power, burn all of their bridges behind them. The true Leviathan, the racket demands the unqualified acceptance of the social contract. A continuum of smooth transitions runs from the sacrifice one’s own mother, which the would-be mage must make as an offering to the racket of sorcerers, to the dissertations of the universities, through which the adept must prove their thinking, feeling, and speaking have irrevocably taken on the forms of the racket of the academy. In certain situations, the outsider’s capacity for achievement may make them an attractive prospect for the racket, but it never entitles them to being incorporated into it. Official legal titles [<em>Rechtstitel</em>] merely attest to membership in a racket; thereby, the state, signing on behalf of all, certifies that the holder belongs to a racket and is thus integrated into the system. Legal titles and illegal titles, membership to the world and membership to the underworld, are distinguished by the fact that the world has at its disposal an all-embracing organization, a protection none shall escape; whoever is proscribed by its agencies is truly forsaken. Even during open conflicts between their umbrella organizations, one regards the individual with whom the other side had all-too serious difficulties with serious suspicion. It cannot be in any doubt that their defection from the one camp to the other is motivated by circumstances extraneous to their essential relation with it, not by their lack of adaptability to it. The Volscians welcomed the fugitive Coriolanus, whose affinity for domination shone far and wide, with open arms. After all, he was a man of the rackets of the gentiles and possessed the qualities of a field general, which are always a recommendation. The fugitive slave, however, is the symbol of the opposite.</p> <p>When an organization is so powerful that it can enforce its will upon a geographical area as permanent rule over the conduct of all its inhabitants, the domination of persons takes the form of laws [<em>Gesetze</em>]. This fixes relative power-relations. As a fixed medium, law [<em>Recht</em>], like other mediations, acquires a nature and force of resistance all its own. In becoming a substantial element of spirit, it incorporates the harmony of universality and particularity as a necessary idea. The sense and purpose of the law [<em>Recht</em>], to serve as the guideline for social life, is conditional upon its disregard for the determinate person and for their past, its validity for and against each and all under its remit until it is openly repealed. The means of domination oppose it as the reflection by which it unmasks itself. Increasingly closed off to those below, with the consolidation of monopoly, the totalitarian shape of society wages war against the law [<em>Recht</em>], against all mediations which have acquired a life of their own and existence in the forms of language. The fundamental illegality of the racket stands opposed to the spirit, even where the racket is not only legal, but stands behind the laws themselves. For as long as legality has existed, it has borne the features of illegality. The racket knows no mercy to life outside itself, but only the law of self-preservation. Under monopoly, language petrifies into a system of signs, more mute and expressionless than morse-code and the tapping-systems of prisoners. Language loses its sense of expression completely. It becomes a mechanism in production, like levers or wires, machinery for the calculations of administration, the embodiment of techniques of suggestion. The spiritual intercourse of individuals is reduced to the display and detection of identification tags. Speech either proves the speaker dependable enough for the rackets or betrays them as the conspirator who flashes the tip of their dagger. Petrified language points in accusation towards heaven like bare tree stumps on abandoned battlefields: it denounces the world of rackets it must yet serve. The mother-bomb launched from its airplane discharges twenty smaller bombs, tearing the fruit of mothers to shreds not once but twenty times over, stands accused for its hellish vocation precisely by the name ‘mother’ under which it has been advertised. The dead woods of words of our era will still bear witness against it after it has passed.</p> <p>Every racket conspires against the spirit; all conspire against and among one another. The reconciliation of universal and particular is immanent to the spirit; the racket is their irreconcilable opposition, though concealed behind ideas of unity and community. The evil is not domination in itself, but the final hardening of domination that defines the racket. From the whispering of the council of the elders in the primitive tribe to the understanding reached between industry and army in private clubs and boardrooms, domination provides the historical documentation of its bad consciences. The brutality of the underclasses, from which the secret of the ruling must be kept, is nothing original, but socially generated. The terrible, bloodthirsty ‘Collective’ that traverses the history of humanity is but the other face of the exclusionary rackets, consciously or unconsciously generated by them. The worn-out costumes of the aristocrats live on as ethnic dress [<em>Volkstrachten</em>], the rackets of the ruling class as the brutality of the stronger towards the weaker, as the indescribable viciousness of the mob towards the powerless. This is the racket of the little man, degenerated cultural heritage. The rackets have always pointed to the fearsomeness of the collectives they generate and direct as the ground of their own necessity, and the unholy naivete of the historian has accordingly mistaken the disfigured grimace of the masses for bare nature. To date, the racket has impressed its stamp on all social appearances; it has ruled as racket of the clergy, the court, the propertied, the race, the men, the adults, the family, the police, the criminal—and within these media themselves, in the form of individual rackets over the rest of their sphere. Everywhere it has set up the opposition between inner and outer; the man who belonged to no racket was outside in a radical sense—he was forsaken. Even in the heads of the isolated [<em>Vereinzelten</em>], rackets still ruled by means of their concepts and the schemata of judgment, the mode and content of thinking stemming from their world. To break through the boundary between inside and outside is the goal of politics, which, if fulfilled, would transform the world. In the true idea of democracy—which even now leads a repressed, subterranean existence among the masses—an intimation of a society free of the racket has never completely died out. To unfold this idea would mean breaking through the ticket of suggestion which still presses the true critique of the racket into its service [… and even now prepares to spread the fascist dictatorship of the industrial monopolies across the surface of the earth under the guise of an attack on the weakened rackets of finance capital.]<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p> <h2 id="history-of-the-american-labor-force-194244">History of the American Labor Force (1942/44)</h2> <p>The historical course of the proletariat led to a crossroads: it could become a class or a racket.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Racket meant privileges within national borders, class meant world revolution. The leaders have relieved the proletariat of this decision.</p> <h2 id="on-the-philosophy-of-law-194244">On the Philosophy of Law (1942/44)</h2> <p>It has been said that punishment arose from revenge.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Society removes such business from the hands of the injured party. Judiciary [<em>Justiz</em>] is an early state monopoly, administered by the authoritative rackets. The separation of powers—of the making, applying, and executing of laws [<em>Gesetze</em>]—then arose as a protective measure for the citizens [<em>Bürger</em>] against the executive. They wanted to get the bureaucracy under control, to limit its arbitrariness, according to their interests. With the concentration of their class today, the need for the division of powers disappears; new rackets unite the powers in their hands, and the idea of universality wanes with the waxing of corruption of parliaments.</p> <p>Since the replacement of revenge by the state—which constitutes the state as its ground, whether it arises through internal development or conquest—there have been many theories of punishment as far as the citizens of the state [<em>Staatsbürger</em>] were concerned; to the slaves and serfs, it was an admitted means of terror. Punishment is rationalized as retribution, restoration, deterrence, protection, and education. Without punishment, society cannot exist, and this sign of its weakness is simultaneously its mark of shame, branding it as the very nature above which it seeks to rise.</p> <p>All of their theories dissolve—that is, in execution. However reasonable their ground for inflicting pain may be, the pain is senseless. Contra medicine, the purpose of punishment is pain. Pain is not the undesired but desired effect of each and every punitive measure. The achievement of its moral purpose, with which it may excuse itself, is questionable and immoral. The power that methodically turns pain against the powerless turns it into means of its own dark ends, hidden behind morality. The enemy is never the object of punishment, for it is always administered to the defenseless. Clearer than through any other institution, it is through punishment society shows it represents not universality but particularity, even if it were that of the majority, excepting only the one who is punished. Every human being could attain universality through insight; there would be no need for pain. Recourse to pain is the confession of the illegality of law [<em>der Illegalität des Rechts</em>].</p> <p>In class society, the particularity is quite pronounced. The laws [<em>Gesetze</em>] are set in pre-established harmony with the rule of cliques which hold weapons and means of production. Religion, especially protestantism, has taken it upon itself to support such domination through the emphasis on evil, through which it glorifies punishment. Before power, this anthropology points upwards with one finger and respectfully bows; before powerlessness, it justifies punishment as divine institution, like poverty and war. But even the overwhelming majority which must resort to punishment is still the false; whoever transfigures it commits idolatry, as did Luther, conscripting spirit in the service of domination to which the flesh is fettered out of fear and need. To the reality of misery, he added the lie that the states and rulers whose ravage fills history, whose ravage is history itself, has a sacred significance. Such a lie was unthinkable before the concept of spirit, which first entered into the world through Christianity and would surely transform it in turn. Such a lie pollutes the Christian centuries.</p> <h2 id="solidarity-19421944">Solidarity (1942/1944)</h2> <p>Solidarity is grounded on shared knowledge.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Due to the necessary inconclusivity of knowing, it seems solidarity is necessarily fleeting. The insights which once bound human beings to one another might prove incorrect. The ruptures in French schools of poetry and painting through the last century, the sworn enmity of friends over a principle, the factional splits between the smallest groups and groupuscules of the extreme left—in any event, these schisms do them more honor than the prudent coherence does psychoanalytic and political gangs.</p> <p>On closer inspection, however, there are motives beyond the theoretical one at the root of those eternal feuds of the old <em>Bohème</em>. In negation of an earlier state of knowledge, it is not crossed out but overcome by determinate negation. The transition is demanded by the thing itself [<em>die Sache selbst</em>], it is inherent within it. The slackening of intellectual forces may keep the individual from carrying this out on their own. However, once this step has been taken by anyone, only the pettiest individual [<em>individuelle</em>] interests can determine the individual [<em>Einzelnen</em>] to defend the duller, more limited mode of thinking against the more precise, richer one. This is neither blind adherence nor mere fidelity, for the more primitive consciousness is always better off when taken up by a more differentiated consciousness than it is by itself. There are mechanical obstacles which stand like walls between the subject and historically adequate knowledge, such that the subject cannot perceive it, even if it exists. But this is why the old and the new are not of equal cognitive standing.</p> <p>According to Marx’s insight, proletarian class interest should not simply oppose the bourgeois, but objectively be the higher. The power of the insight [<em>Einsichtigkeit</em>] into this objectivity facilitated the defection of the sons of the bourgeoisie over to the side of the struggling workers. The reverse path, from the proletarian to the bourgeoise, was betrayal—betrayal of truth, as much as it was for the remaining bourgeoisie to remain in an ideology which had long since become transparent as such. They were not cut off from knowledge by social fact, but by the obstinate narrowing of their own horizons for private advantage. For so long they were resolved to disclaim, to turn away from what they hypocritically cried out were the highest of values—religion and truth, love of humanity and justice—until they had become too stupid for private advantage itself and are now, for all their pedantic cleverness, rightly reduced to nothing.</p> <p>Considerations for career tempered the disputes of the <em>Bohème</em>. Whatever in solidarity is threatened by the process of knowing is that which is still impure and bad in it. Not a few communities have fallen apart without solidarity being extinguished. Every once in a while, it was picked up by a single one abandoned by all.</p> <h2 id="a-theory-of-the-criminal-19431944">A Theory of the Criminal (1943/1944)</h2> <p>The more fragmented it was, the more mediated domination was.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Individual property owners did not keep the poor down as the feudal lord and the oriental despot had with satraps and personal guards, the simple continuation of barbaric-physical violence; their will had to be objectified in law, and so limit the totality of the power it represents. Law [<em>Gesetz</em>] as means of domination develops a logic of its own, an opposition to domination which cannot be overcome by sending out silk thread. Whoever offends in bourgeois society is no longer taboo like the transgressor of primitive solidarity, no longer the rebellious slave or serf. The offender does not merely stand outside their society, but is rather the exponent of a conflict which resides within that society itself. The social principle to which the law owes its existence is reproduced in the criminal. Even through the religious hymn to the worldly sword of the executioner [<em>Richtschwert</em>] of which Protestantism sang, the human-inhuman origin of law [<em>Recht</em>] shines through, the will of the minority giving itself the form of the majority. The many lords who, though in competition with one another, sought to control the authorities, had to grant a kind of autonomy not only for their own economic command but also to the protection against the competing, executive organs of terror, so they took up the law. Criminal law protects the citizen not only from the crime, but also from the state supposed to avenge it. The perpetrator, the outsider, is still thought of as an individual. Bourgeois criminal law goes back to the civil law of the primitives rather than the measures against the transgressors, so far as one can speak of such a law at all. Positive law, “governing all the phases of tribal life,” says Malinowski, “consists… of a body of binding obligations, regarded as a right by one party and acknowledged as a duty by the other, kept in force by a specific mechanism of reciprocity and publicity inherent in the structure of their society. … Their stringency is ensured through the rational appreciation of cause and effect by the natives, combined with a number of social and personal sentiments… .”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> The formulation of principles and laws belongs to exchange. It is connected with the consolidation of private property,<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> which, ultimately, makes human beings into subjects. The market comes by its opposite honestly; the market, like money, demands the law. There is an affinity between the two media of the economy [viz., law and money]. They are universal in form: one cannot tell from the law itself where it will have effect, nor from money where it comes—although in actuality, one is drawn to the poor, the other to the rich. Precisely the neutrality of the media, their formal universality, determines the member of the bourgeois world as subject, which is the same in all. These [media] first create the concept of the human being. Personality has at least rudimentary legal relations [<em>Rechtsverhältnisse</em>], a universal for its presupposition. The criminal counts on such universality. So far as his <em>ratio</em> extends, he grabs hold of the chances that flow his way from the anonymity of the means which make him equal as well. The accursed, godforsaken, the poor sinner, affront to gods and men, is the violator of the articles of the law; the criminal, a product of humanity.</p> <p>The deception—as if among the bourgeois there were criminals other than the perpetrators of crimes against property—is ideology in the truest sense: illusory semblance to which individuals are necessarily subject given their role in the social process. Murder is certainly no longer punished less than theft, as in periods of scarcity of goods and labor. Since the Lord said <em>vengeance is mine</em>, the state has monopolized the system of vengeance, to which the individual is held to account whether they commit sacrilege, sexual murder, embezzlement, or theft. The business of the state requires uniform guidelines. Even juridical concepts are subject to leveling. Their opposition to one another is erased as every violation is measured by the same measure according to a common denominator of punishment. This reduction was accomplished according to the schema of property. The category of the commodity has taken hold of all branches of human intercourse to the effect that even life and limb are understood, attacked, or kept under guard according to the model of property. Everything within reach of human beings becomes something at someone’s disposal, an object of the legal subject [<em>Gegenstand</em> <em>des Rechtssubjekts</em>]. The law [<em>das</em> <em>Recht</em>] was even involved in the constitution of the body itself. Just as each logical classification points back to painful separations in actuality, so too do the parts of the body point back to the oldest proprietary rights [<em>Rechtsschutz</em>]. Any injury to the Lord and to his ‘hands’ [<em>Gesindes</em>]<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> had a price corresponding to the impairment [<em>Beeinträchtigung</em>] resulting from the loss. The hand was dearer than the ear. The parts of the body [<em>Körperteile</em>] belong to the body, and the body belongs to the person. The state protected its ‘member’<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> as the owner of his body [<em>Leibes</em>], and under such protection [<em>Schutz</em>] the individual formed as the embodiment of the psychological. Proprietary right over the body is a special case of the protection of private property. The bloom of criminal law coincides with those times in which the central state identified its internal peace with the security of property.</p> <p>In the concept of the criminal, bourgeois society reassures itself that it knows how to unify universal and particular interest, for only so far as it guarantees self-preservation to each can it condemn by [its] reason what it prosecutes by [its] particularism. The theoretical concept of the crime cannot be separated from the construction of the state contract by which it obliges people into obedience to the state, given that they, for the sake of their own well-being, transferred the highest of powers over to it. “But by safety must be understood,” Hobbes writes, “not the sole preservation of life in what condition soever, but in order to its happiness. For to this end did men freely assemble themselves, and institute a government, that they might, as much as their human condition would afford, live delightfully.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Once the state contract is in effect, the criminal is in breach of his own pragmatic reason which confronts him as objective in the state. This defines the criminal in distinction from the evildoer. For bourgeois thinking, there is no sin but that against the principle of the self. The criminal violates consistent, organized self-preservation for the sake of the limited, anarchic. His prudence [<em>Klugheit</em>] comes up short. He is incapable of waiting. He is all-calculating yet wants for calculating intelligence. He is punished for his folly. Any other theory of punishment betrays society’s doubts about its own rationality. The concepts of state contract and reason are equivalent for the bourgeoisie. Society regards itself as concrete reason, the union of the rational who would protect themselves from nature in common. Towards those who do not pay for their incorporation with strict obedience, society itself administers the destructive force of nature, the very same from which society had provided them escape; society becomes a premeditated, systematic force of nature in comparison to which the unmediated force of nature, for all its cruelty, still appears the truer state of innocence.</p> <p>The stigma of the criminal is uselessness. He skips over the stage of production and seeks to appropriate as much circulating surplus value as possible for himself. The industrialist, businessman, advertising agent, professor stick to circulation as well, but in the fulfillment of their contract. The criminal, however, represents on the inside what the war presents to the outside: the capture of surplus value under the elimination of exchange. Robber barons, condottiere, volunteer corps [<em>Freischärler</em>], racketeers vacillate between warrior and criminal. Whichever pole they are assigned is not up to them, but to the given state of domestic and foreign policy. Crime is the deed <em>par excellence</em>, appropriation without exchange. It forms the naive counterpart to the ownership of property [<em>Besitz</em>], which, much like itself, creates no goods, either as manual or intellectual labor, and yet exacts its tribute, whether squeezing it directly from the factory or indirectly through interests and dividends. This secret kinship with crime, the social affinity of the poles: the privileged and the condemned, provokes the proprietor to revenge. He has the entirety of the armed forces on his side; the criminal, at best, a machine gun. But property ownership, without which there would be no ego nor conscience, consciencelessly suffers not another blackmailer besides it. The life lived on one’s own terms without service to the system trespasses against the divine order of things. Criminals and capitalists are only out for profit; they are not interested in any work. The ‘joy of work’ is an ideology of large-scale industry in the period already in the process of the liquidation of the bankers and the sphere of circulation as a whole: a conceptual schema for the administration of human beings under monopoly. The capitalistic criminal wasn’t violent from the start. As a burgher, he preferred profit without bloodshed to military actions. He only resorted to war and state of siege when the existence of the class was thrown into question or there were surplus profits to be obtained. The career criminal feels much the same. “In the execution of the crime, a ‘good’ criminal avoids unnecessary cruelty and murder. The thing to aim at is ‘big money.’ The risk is equal whether you are stealing seven or seventy thousand dollars. ‘I don’t look to kill anybody. If I can prevent it, I will. But I would shoot somebody to get away, if there’s plenty of money there, say $100,000.’”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> The criminal represents the more irrational, more primitive racket in comparison to the state-protected class monopoly. His profession points back to early-bourgeois and pre-bourgeois forms of domination; these continue to thrive in the present as Mafia and Camorra, despised like overthrown deities become demonic powers for the new religion. Contemporary domination perpetuates itself in forms, however destructive to human beings they may ultimately prove, through which social life is reproduced at the same time. The criminal, on the other hand, too weak to punch above his weight with his contemporaries, apes domination which has already become obsolete. He has no part in the social reproduction of life to the end of its domination. To this extent, he is destructive.</p> <p>Where bourgeois society confronts nature directly, production and destruction coincide. In the slaughterhouse, murder [<em>Totschlag</em>] is at one with the production of the means of life. But in the relation of the classes to one another, the functions are differentiated: the entrepreneur has command over production, the policeman hunts down the criminal. Violence is no less essential to the bourgeoisie than to those forms of society in which the sword and the whip were still in the hands of the master or of those in his immediate vicinity. Wherever one clan [<em>Sippe</em>] or class would reserve the possibility of a relatively secure life for itself while leaving the other to hunger, insecurity, and labor, it needs to maintain its hold upon the force to strike as well, whether in the shape of a club to repel strangers from entering one’s cave or the nightstick to murder prisoners in the cellar of the police precinct. Due to the division of labor, this force crystallizes into apparatuses of oppression on the reverse side of culture. In the penal system and the police, every instinct of destruction finds somewhere to hide. By contrast, the destruction brought about by crime is not assigned to it by the division of labor. It is merely a deduction from production. Despite Mandeville’s illuminating suggestions concerning the productivity of destruction in general, and the dependency of arts and trades on crime in particular<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>—which Marx complements with his own satirical apology for crime, in its significance for technology, economy, and culture<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>—it remains a mere ferment of reversion and dissolution. At best, the criminal becomes an honest bandit who murders for a fixed sum. He remains at this stage just as quack doctors and faith healers still linger at that of the alchemist in the transition to natural science. The criminal will not surrender his freedom nor pocket his winnings without becoming a member of the enterprise he succumbs to. He cannot make himself into a subject, no matter how hard he tries. Black Will, the cutthroat in <em>Arden of Feversham</em>,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> long before <em>The Beggar’s Opera</em>,<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> already exhibits the ethos of the businessman [<em>Ethos des Kaufmanns</em>] who keeps the contract even when it proves unfavorable. “I have had ten pound to steal a dog, and we have no more here to kill a man; but that a bargain is a bargain, … .”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> His ideal is that of security for the branch of industry in which he is employed. “Ah, that I might be set a work thus through the year, and that murder would grow to an occupation, that a man might follow without danger of the law: – zounds, I warrant I should be warden of the company!”<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Will is a thwarted entrepreneur. But private murder was a poor line of work anyway; it was only the object of regular commerce as long as commerce itself was half-taboo. With the police, it is another matter entirely: henchmen and hangmen who share in the crookedness of the criminal and the brutality of his profession, but not in his autonomy. Though their licensed violence functions for the sake of money as well, they are not paid for services rendered, nor in spoils like Black will, but receive a wage. The policeman, the state prosecutor, and the judge bear no responsibility for the existence and content of their profession; they are essentially instruments, and only have power as such. They thus consider themselves to be of a third degree because they publicly accept wages for the first. If the criminal is the crippled, retarded twin brother of the bourgeois, the police agent is his authorized representative [<em>Prokurist</em>]. The principle in both is the same: violence, without which bourgeois property cannot exist.</p> <p>In the deed of the criminal, however, the reversion into earlier stages of development is united with the most extreme consequence of progress: it negates taboos. In planning and execution, the criminal only takes the power of the law [<em>Gesetz</em>] and its servants into consideration, but not [power, not] the thing itself [<em>die</em> <em>Sache</em>]. The overcoming of fear before this thing was the way of the bourgeois spirit from the very beginning. After the dissolution of nature in things, however, which brought the evildoers to a halt, there is no reserve for it in humanity either. Humanity establishes its dominion without restriction. The radicality of this is revealed in crime. When bourgeois thinking set out to emancipate itself from shrinking back in terror, it shied away from nothing as crime. The result is that thinking and doing, each driven to their extreme, collapse into one another: the doing merely uncovers the powerlessness of things already realized for thinking. The content, the spirit of the thing, which the crime ignores, is the secret which, according to the enlightenment, does not exist at all. Thus the worship of blind violence out of desperation for rescue from the cycle of transgression and revenge, in which crime is mythical, is one with progress itself. The abstract self of the enlightenment, which can convert nature into propaganda because it is no longer arrested by any content within it, and only ever knows its own purposes, is in the crime shot through with the senselessness of totally objectified nature. It is the deed that shrinks back from nothing and yet remains the very shrinking of the primitive into whose soul no glimmer of rescue from the darkness of the cycle breaks: this is the deed that lights the way forward for the bourgeoisie on its path towards dynamic society.</p> <h1 id="internal-memos">Internal Memos</h1> <h2 id="la-memo-1942">LA Memo (1942)</h2> <p><strong>Memorandum. On parts of the Los Angeles work-program that cannot be carried out by the philosophers.</strong></p> <p>The total plan of the work relates to a comprehensive critique of present-day ideology.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Ideology is to be understood not only as the consciousness, but also the constitution of human beings in the present phase, i.e., anthropology in the sense the concept is used in “Egoism and Freedom Movements.” Particular emphasis is to be placed on the connection of the practical, “realistic” spirit—as has found its philosophical expression in pragmatism—and fascism. It is, however, not the underlying <em>thema probandum</em>. The emancipatory features of enlightenment and pragmatism should be worked out just as much as the repressive. The attack on dominant ideology should consist in a critical analysis of both decisive spiritual-intellectual spheres and mass culture. The success of such analyses essentially depends on their orientation to concrete insights into the most recent economic developments; for the whole aims at overcoming political stagnation.</p> <p>By no means is it to be thought of as a comprehensive presentation of the economic situation of the present and its theory. Rather, the economic parts should center on specific individual questions of great importance, all of which relate to the theory of classes.</p> <p>In the following, we will identify the individual problems which lie particularly close to our hearts. It should be self-evident that these questions can be reformulated by the economists.,</p> <ol> <li>What has become of the proletariat in the monopolistic-fascistic phase? Can it still be defined today in the sense it was in <em>Capital</em>? What effect has monopolization had on the differentiations within the proletariat? To what extent do changes in differentiation mean changes in class-consciousness, or in the structure and role of the party?</li> <li>What has become of the capitalist class? To what extent is the capitalist class in accord with itself, nationally and internationally? Relation between trade, finance, manufacturing and heavy industry. Stage of the process of concentration. What changes has capitalist class-consciousness undergone, and how to the capitalists stand in their attitude towards dominant ideologies, e.g., individualism and collectivism?</li> <li>The question of the class character of bureaucracy. We should arrive at a clear consensus about the present controversy. For this, it is probably necessary to trace bureaucratization back to its various roots (professional civil service, joint stock company, etc.). Particular attention should be paid to the problem of the separation—or fusion—of property titles and the power of disposal. Weight should also be given to the influence of technical changes, to the transition from mediated to immediate domination. The factory is developing from a business enterprise to an institution with its own “form of life,” consciously created “community,” mythology of order, and hierarchy. The role of oversight for managers in the various spheres of culture.</li> <li>Does technological differentiation lead to greater convergence or divergence of the various types of work? The chances for democracy in the future depend on the answer to this question. The most recent publication of the CIO on “Industrial Democracy” (Reuttenberg and another author) seems to contradict the thesis of progressive divergence represented by Pollock and Neumann against Marcuse.</li> <li>How does academic and non-academic discussion today stand with respect to Marxian theory? It would be of the utmost importance to first conduct a survey of this discussion to subsequently work through in a critical manner. What is the position of trade union leadership towards Marxist and non-Marxist theory? Is there any serious effort being undertaken to develop Marxian economics further? What other important theorems should be seriously contemplated today?</li> <li>In relative separation from the above questions, there is the problem relating to the direct control of mass culture by monopoly. It would have the greatest significance for the project to have a clear notion of the mechanisms of control, economic and personal, through which each of the important spheres and the cultivation of the next generation are regulated. This is rather simple to establish in the case of film; the most important data is still to be compiled from other areas (radio, newspapers, magazines, universities, and scientific foundations). To this belongs the interconnections between individual sectors of the culture-industry. Perhaps Upton Sinclair, who studied a number of these questions at an earlier point in time, will be of use for these investigations. Furthermore, the literary-sociological side of the work, which has so far extended only to German and American biographies, ought to be expanded to other branches of popular literature and to the specific categories of such work as a whole.</li> </ol> <p>In the following, we provide several suggestions which should be pursued further in future correspondence. Further areas for literary analysis come to mind: best sellers and the publications of book clubs; movie-magazines, especially those which report on the stars and their private lives; introductions to the drugstore editions of major literary works; program booklets for philharmonic concerts and other kinds of entertainment; analysis of advertisements.</p> <p>Categories in connection with the big work:</p> <ul> <li>“Unmasking” but not attack</li> <li>Reduction of quality to quantity, malice towards different qualities</li> <li>Accept blows without rancor to eventually be included in racket</li> <li>Apology for the accidentality and irrationality of career (no development)</li> <li>Indifference to the area in which one finds success</li> <li>Glorification of determinate practical qualities, especially in the extra-practical domain (e.g. dexterity, quick-wittedness, aggressivity, technical specialist knowledge and tricks, “performance,” endurance, pseudo-radicalism)</li> <li>Antinomies: the hero must be individual and average at the same time.</li> <li>Conscious subordination of law [<em>Recht</em>] to the collectivity</li> <li>Success as justification.</li> </ul> <p>Naturally, many of these aspects are already included within the biographical work. Others which have already arisen have here been deliberately omitted. The end goal would be to develop them on the basis of a unified theoretical context—namely, the tendency towards the unification of the world.</p> <h2 id="notes-for-the-programme-of-the-book-8301942">Notes for the Programme of the Book (8/30/1942)</h2> <ul> <li>The part on the theory of immiseration [<em>Verelendungstheorie</em>] should be used to show that with the decrease in immiseration, with the integration of the workers into existing society, the class constitutes itself as the epitome of individual rackets, and accordingly cuts out everything which no longer belongs to the class in this sense.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> For the first time, this relation should be presented not as it always has been to date, by the enemies of the proletariat, but by a proletarian theory itself.</li> </ul> <p><ins> Problem:</ins></p> <ul> <li>Should there be a historical unity?

Unlike most animals, humans do not have immediate access to their own conditions of reproduction. The tools and knowledge necessary for their metabolic interchange with nature is mediated through social formations, even what constitutes human needs at any given historical period is socially mediated, unlike what modern psychology might want us to believe.<d-footnote>See Adorno’s critique of the false division of basic and non-basic needs in Theodor W Adorno, “Theses on Need,” trs.

Gunzelin Schmid Noerr (S. Fischer Verlag, 1985), 287</d-footnote> Human production (and reproduction) is mediated through tools that arise in specific social relations, the same tools in turn start to mediate the social relations, human organizations and ways of living come to be “prescribed by the nature of such tools.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Marx conceptualizes tools as <em>organs</em> of production, as a corporeal part of the human body required for human metabolism:</p> <blockquote> <p>The first thing of which the labourer possesses himself is not the subject of labour but its instrument. Thus Nature becomes one of the organs of his activity, one that he annexes to his own bodily organs, adding stature to himself in spite of the Bible.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1*, in *Marx/Engels Collected Works* (hereafter MECW), vol. 35 (Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1996), 189</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>As Søren Mau has recently pointed out, as instruments of production (qua organs) can become the private property of individuals and groups, it “has the consequence that power can weave itself into the very fabric of the human metabolism.”<d-footnote>Søren Mau, *Mute Compulsion: A Marxist Theory of the Economic Power of Capital* (Verso, 2023), 115</d-footnote> The theoretical core of the concepts of the relations and forces of production consists in this fact, namely that human metabolism and reproduction is organized in definite social relations with the use of tools. Following Engels, Horkheimer argues that the primacy of tools in production is mirrored by the development of patriarchy apropos transition from mother-right to father-right with the concrete development of sedentary agriculture. The bygone age of matriarchy is associated with that of pre-history, an era without class conflict that did not objectify humans as tools for social reproduction;<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family” in *Critical theory: Selected Essays*, tr. Matthew J. O’Connell et al (Continuum, 1982), 118</d-footnote> Durkheim, meanwhile, associates pre-history without the division between public and private life as mechanical solidarity, contrasted with the organic solidarity of modernity with its highly specialized division of labour that grants its members some semblance of individuality.<d-footnote>Émile Durkheim, *The Division of Labour in Society*, trans. W. D. Halls, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013).</d-footnote> In actuality, this division between private and public signified the development of class society with domination within and outside the family by different groups of people organized in a hierarchy. The development of patriarchy and class are deeply intertwined.</p> <p>Early critical theory explicitly uses the dialectic between forces and relations of production as a starting point to develop a theory of class. The ownership of the means and objects of production by different members of the species was primarily maintained by repression of direct producers. The repression was rationalized as being in the long-term interests of the whole of society because it purportedly incentivized social and economic development; this development in turn made the forces of repression obsolete and irrational.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory” in *Can One Live After Auschwitz? A Philosophical Reader*, ed. Rolf Tiedemann (Stanford University Press, 2003), 110</d-footnote> The subordination of individuals in a hierarchy appears as rational until the conditions of social reproduction change through the development of society (apropos the forces of production.) As emblematically articulated by Max Weber, the concept of rationality in traditional theory meant the use of reason by a transcendental calculating subject to navigate the world of values.<d-footnote>See Weber’s discussion on formal rationality in Max Weber, Economy and Society: A New Translation, trans. Keith Tribe (Harvard University Press, 2019,) 172-177; Gillian Rose on Weber’s neo-kantian inheritance in Gillian Rose, Hegel Contra Sociology, (Verso, 2009,) 22-23; Horkheimer on the Marburg school and the status of the individual in Horkheimer, “Traditional and Critical Theory,” 198-200.</d-footnote> Horkheimer appropriates the concept of rationality as itself arising from historically developing social relations that organizes the conditions of social reproduction. It is not “false” consciousness to accept the conditions of subordination but rather it is in “the [immediate] interests of those who were ruled… It was a condition for the development of mankind’s capabilities.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 70</d-footnote> At stake is how humans navigate and internalize the limits of social formations as activity rather than as mere automatons fully path-dependent on a structure.</p> <p>Hence, the intersection of the process of production and the form of exploitation is central to understanding the class structure of any given social formation.<d-footnote>See “Introduction: Themes in Historical Materialism” in Jairus Banaji, *Theory as History: Essays on Modes of Production and Exploitation*, (Haymarket, 2010).</d-footnote> The processes through which the surplus labour of direct producers is appropriated by the owners of the means of production influences the forms of thinking (and social control) in society that become embodied in relatively autonomous institutions such as the family, education, and religion—the Institut für Sozialforschung prefigures what is later conceptualized as the ideological state apparatus that stabilizes the structure of capitalism by Louis Althusser.<d-footnote>See Louis Althusser, *On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses*, trans. G. M. Goshgarian (London New York: Verso, 2014).</d-footnote> As Horkheimer himself puts it:</p> <blockquote> <p>“To regard the economic process as a determining ground of events means that one considers all other spheres of social life in their changing relationships to it and that one conceives this process itself not in its isolated mechanical form but in connection with the specific capabilities and dispositions of men, which have, of course, been developed by the economic process itself.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 52</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>On the flipside, Horkheimer interrogates the processes of internalization and rationalization of authority by direct producers (and the excluded), which is characteristically reflected in the culture of a society. The “so-called social nature” of humanity that appears natural to positivist psychologists as the “self-integration into a given order of things”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 56</d-footnote> through institutions such as religion is reducible to “the memory of the acts of force by which men were made ‘sociable’ and civilized and which threaten them still if they become too forgetful.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 52</d-footnote> The history of direct domination and its social memory is reflected in the tendency to accept conditions of indirect domination—the history of the caste system and its continuing prevalence today in both direct and indirect forms serves as the paradigmatic example. The liberal hope that the caste system would be eventually supplanted by the development of capitalism was never realized, caste domination was instead integrated with capitalist social relations.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 62-65.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="class-contract-and-monopoly">Class, Contract and Monopoly</h2> <p>Marx extensively wrote about class and class struggle throughout his life but never developed a systematic theory of class per se. Infamously, the manuscript for the third volume of C<em>apital</em> ends just as Marx begins a section on class. Furthermore, Michael Heinrich argues that the concept of class in the three volumes of <em>Capital</em> appears as the (unwritten) result of the unfolding categories of political economy rather than a precondition/assumption for a systematic theory of capitalism.<d-footnote>Michael Heinrich, *An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Karl Marx’s Capital*, tr. Alexander Locasio (Monthly Review Press, 2012), 192</d-footnote> Marx describes his method as “rising from the abstract to the concrete,”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, “Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58” in Karl Marx: 1857-61, Collected Works 28 (Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1986), 38 See section 3 of the Introduction in the volume for more on Marx’s method, 37–45..</d-footnote> developing the most abstract concepts of classical political economy that are layered on top of each other to describe complex tendencies that exist within capitalism as a historically emergent system. Marx starts with describing the dynamics of commodities as products of labour, from which he derives most other mutually interlocking concepts and categories of “exchange value and use value, exchange value and value, concrete and abstract labour, as well as the necessity of money and its functions, the concept of capital, the theory of surplus value and exploitation, the class relation underlying all of this, and so on.”<d-footnote>Mau, *Mute Compulsion*, 13</d-footnote> Thus, the concept of class in the capitalist mode of production is dependent on all these other interlocking concepts. This is quite different from modern sociological theories that abstractly conceptualize class in terms of social stratification based on occupation and their income brackets (i.e. lower, middle, and upper classes). Following Marx, Horkheimer conceptualizes class as a concrete historical category that cannot be understood in isolation/abstraction from the actual processes of social reproduction in a given social formation. Class is simultaneously understood at a structural level as the social position of a group within a specific social formation and as a group cognizant of itself as a class apropos its social location. Class as a political agent, or an interest group only exists if individuals that share common interests are conscious of their own social position.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> In “Reflections on Class Theory,” Adorno points out that “the concept of class is bound up with the emergence of the proletariat.”<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 93</d-footnote> Class only becomes intelligible with the universal domination over the proletariat through necessitating conditions that require an individual to sell her labour-power for wages, a situation which is the result of the ongoing process of primitive accumulation.<d-footnote>Most readings of Marx on primitive accumulation understand it as something restricted to the past. For Marx, however, primitive accumulation is a necessary component of capitalism as a system. Capitalism functions through the continual appropriation of resources that create conditions of wage labour. See William Clare Roberts, “What Was Primitive Accumulation? Reconstructing the Origin of a Critical Concept,” *European Journal of Political Theory* 19, no. 4 (October 2020): 532–52, [https://doi.org/10.1177/1474885117735961](https://doi.org/10.1177/1474885117735961)</d-footnote> The declaration that “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles”<d-footnote>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, “Manifesto of the Communist Party” in MECW*,* Vol. 6 (Lawrence and Wishart, 1976) 484</d-footnote> in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> implied that what was previously thought of as natural hierarchies of the primitive tribe or the divine right of kings were nothing but stronger groups dominating the weaker ones to control production and thereby exist outside the immediate process of production qua labour, i.e. to be served by majority of the population.<d-footnote>As Horkheimer puts it, “to assume authority over large areas in order to be nourished and housed and served by as large a population as possible. The same holds good for the ruling groups of Greek antiquity, as represented by the city-states and factions.” Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The past is understood retroactively through the present—or inversely, as Adorno puts it, the history of domination and oppression culminates in the universal domination of capitalism.<d-footnote>“If all the oppression that man has ever inflicted on man culminates in the modern age in the cold inhumanity of free wage labor, then the past is revealed in conditions and things – the romantic contrast to industrial reason – as the trace of former suffering. The archaic silence of pyramids and ruins becomes conscious of itself in materialist thought: it is the echo of factory noise in the landscape of the immutable.” Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 94</d-footnote> Hence, for Marx (and the critical theorists), class struggle implied the fight against the system of capitalism and the very concept of classes as such.</p> <p>The capitalist process of production is based on the “so-called labour contract,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, Authority and the Family, 86</d-footnote> where the worker could sell her labour-power for a wage through which she could access the conditions of her continual reproduction. The contract guaranteed by the state and law, which were (purportedly) and to varying degrees held up by democratic institutions that represented the will of the people within the nation-state. However, this free contract concealed the actual inequality between people, where an individual worker was more “dependent on the settlement of a contract” than the owners of Capital, who could choose between workers.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This meant that the working class had to adapt to existing unequal conditions by competition (contra struggle) amongst themselves as each individual worker had to compete against others to sell her labour, which meant that wages rarely rose above subsistence levels, and even below subsistence observed throughout the history of capitalism. Hence, “The distinction between employer and worker lay in the fact that this impersonal necessity […] represented for the employer the condition for his control and for the worker a pitiless fate.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> The subordination of the individual to irrational economic circumstances through the contract is also personal submission to the will of an employer.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>The Soviet jurist Evgeny Pashukanis locates the birth of legality and the institution of law with the development and universalization of capitalist social relations. In capitalism, the relationship of exploitation is legally mediated through the form of the contract as the worker disposes of her labour power as a commodity on the market, in contrast with direct forms of subjugation seen in societies based on slavery and serfdom. Social regulation, sanctions, and disciplinary mechanisms are rendered through the legal form rather than direct unalienated punishment.<d-footnote>Michel Foucault shows the transition between direct punishment to indirect punishment through the legal apparatus. Michel Foucault, *Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison,* tr. Alan Sheridan (Vintage Books, 1995)</d-footnote> Hence Pashukanis argues that it is only in capitalism that “the legal form attains universal significance, legal ideology becomes the ideology par excellence, and defending the class interest of the exploiters appears with ever increasing success as the defense of the abstract principle of legal subjectivity.”<d-footnote>Evgeny Bronislavovich Pashukanis, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism*, tr. Barbara Einhorn, ed. Chris Arthur (Transaction, 2002), 45</d-footnote> The primary function of the legal form is the concealment of the actuality of exploitation in the process of production, which is accompanied by the reduction of individuals (who embody differences) to a formal equality as subjects of the law. The legal form becomes the essential “precondition for the non-coercive extraction of surplus value, on which the reproduction of the capitalist relations of production rest.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> For Horkheimer, the ban on collective bargaining and the state control over contracts in fascism “revealed what was already inherent in liberalism.” Hence, “it would be a grave theoretical mistake to denounce the contract in modern totalitarianism as a mere formality, and stress its genuine authenticity under liberalism.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The very impersonal nature of the labour contract incentivizes reactionary responses by hiding the actual relations of exploitation between people, which in conditions of social crisis leads to minority groups being held as a scapegoat.<d-footnote>See Moishe Postone, “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism: Notes on the German Reaction to "Holocaust",” *New German Critique*, no. 19 (1980): 97–115, [https://doi.org/10.2307/487974](https://doi.org/10.2307/487974).</d-footnote></p> <p>The development of capitalism is highlighted by intra-class struggle within the ruling class as the logic of monopolization/expansion comes in conflict with each other, alongside the primary struggle between producers and owners of the means of production. The ruling class, “has always been characterized by its internal struggles, by the efforts of one of its parts to secure the spoils that others might appropriate. The struggle for security among the elite has been a race for the most far-reaching command possible, in other words, for control of production.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The development of nation-states lead to the struggle over industries central to social reproduction of economic life, which in turn lead to the dominance of a small number of elite families over these industries. The tendency towards monopolization closely knit with the intra-class conflict within the bourgeoisie is mutually determined by the inner tendencies of capital accumulation and pre-capitalist social forms such as caste. What the economists understood as externalities that hampered intended functioning of the market were rather immanent to the very functioning of the logic of capitalist accumulation; it is in the direct interests of the ruling class to reduce and hamper competition amongst themselves through subordinating one another while incentivizing competition in the working class to reduce wages.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>The discrepancy between the legal discourse<d-footnote>As Pashukanis argues, “The constitutional state is a mirage, but one which suits the bourgeoisie very well \[…\] Power as the 'collective will', as the 'rule of law'. is realised in bourgeois society to the extent that this society represents a market.” [Pashukanis, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism*, 147](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?uVZXCo).</d-footnote> of the abstract individual who can freely interact with the market and the actuality of unfreedom is highlighted by this tendency of monopolization immanent to class society. The assertion that <em>real</em> utopian ideals of liberalism qua capitalism is corrupted by what are <em>purportedly</em> external forces of the state and bureaucracy becomes the ideological rationalization of the struggle within the ruling class. Labels such as cronyism are attributed to those who gain an advantageous monopoly position through political and ideological connections with the existing state. The utopian ideal of liberalism naturalizes capitalist social relations as a fundamental part of human existence while simultaneously denying the immanent tendencies of capitalism. This highlights the actual non-identity of the concept of class; it designates the real unity of (bourgeois) interests of a class that is accompanied by its actual dis-unity.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 98</d-footnote> These discrepancies are accentuated during monopolization as the entirety of society is pitted against itself to gain control over resources necessary for social reproduction, members of a social strata attempt to better their social position while suppressing the members of strata below them—social mobility is intimately interwoven with the subordination of others within the constraints of class society.</p> <p>The development of organizational forms with a rigid hierarchy, which Horkheimer calls totalities, is not merely a result of the optimization mechanisms of the capitalist market that maximizes allocative efficiency of resources,<d-footnote>See R. H. Coase, “The Nature of the Firm,” *Economica* 4, no. 16 (November 1937): 386–405, [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x)</d-footnote> but rather contains within itself the history of struggle for the control over resources. The power relations that have developed over time and the optimization mechanisms of the market mutually determine each other. The concept of allocative efficiency is reframed as the most effective method of monopolizing resources that are not fully integrated into capitalist relations of production through what Marx called the original/primitive accumulation. While monopolies have always existed throughout the development of capitalism, the monopoly stage of capitalism only arises with the near-full integration of capital in social life and state vis-a-vis control over production by a small minority.</p> <p>For Paul A. Baran and Paul Sweezy, monopolies are big corporations that are highly efficient rational calculators for extracting social surplus. They are “profit maximizers and capital accumulators,” and “they are managed by company men whose fortunes are identified with the corporations’ success or failure.”<d-footnote>Paul A. Baran and Paul M. Sweezy, *Monopoly Capital: An Essay on the American Economic and Social Order*, (Monthly Review Press, 1968).</d-footnote> These monopolies start organizing normal economic life with aid from the state as they control the price system, tax and labour policy to maximize production and profitability of the corporation. Production is centralized in a small number of production units that are hierarchically organized for the efficient transfer of information and social control over the workers.<d-footnote>Otto Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” in *The Journal of Politics*, May, 1944, Vol. 6, No. 2, 139-176 [https://doi.org/10.2307/2125270](https://doi.org/10.2307/2125270); 148</d-footnote> This is accompanied by change in the production process (what Marx called real subsumption<d-footnote>In the economic manuscripts of 1861-63, Marx writes about the real subsumption of capitalism as changing the very nature of work to suit the needs of capital accumulation as opposed to formal subsumption, where surplus is extracted from pre-capitalist ways of production. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, MECW, Vol. 34 (Lawrence and Wishart, 1994) 104–17.</d-footnote>): the scientific management of Taylor and the moving conveyor belts that fed the highly specialized division of labour of Ford.<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 145</d-footnote> Otto Kirchheimer in “Quest for Sovereignty” demonstrates that highly organized <em>hierarchical</em> monopolies efficiently “[respond] quite often to the needs of government” as self interested bourgeoise nation-states under specific conditions such as war, “leads to a wholesome transfer of public authority to the principal agencies of private self-administration.”<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, op. cit., 150</d-footnote> With hindsight, we can observe that the process of privatization has taken place regardless of any extraneous conditions. Hence, Adorno points out that with monopolization</p> <blockquote> <p>The ruling class disappears behind the concentration of capital. This latter has reached a magnitude and acquired a weight of its own that enables capital to present itself as an institution, as the expression of society as a whole. By virtue of its omnipotence, the particular is able to usurp the totality: this overall social aspect of capital is the endpoint of the old fetish character of the commodity according to which relations between men are reflected back to them as relations between things.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 99</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In the mid-20th century, monopoly capitalism could absorb the majority of the population into the production process—at least in the first world. This fundamentally changed with the further development of capitalism into neo-liberal capitalism with the regulation and creation of new markets in spheres that were previously managed by the state such as education.<d-footnote>David Harvey, *A Brief History of Neoliberalism* (Oxford University Press, 2005), 65</d-footnote> The result was a massive tide of exclusion from the production process, and therefore the expansion of what Marx called the relative surplus population.<d-footnote>“The labouring population therefore produces, along with the accumulation of capital produced by it, the means by which it itself is made relatively superfluous, is turned into a relative surplus population; and it does this to an always increasing extent.” Marx, *Capital*, 623</d-footnote> The expansion of the surplus population was simultaneously accompanied by the total integration of all aspects of life into the market.</p> <p>What, then, is the nature of class and class struggle with this furthering integration of capitalism into every facet of life? Horkheimer points out that during the revolutionary movements of the 19th and early 20th century, capitalism did not fully hold sway over every aspect of life—there were spaces with relative autonomy for individual entrepreneurs, subsistence producers, etc. As the impersonal market forces of capitalism began to dominate almost everyone with extending monopolization (and later on the advent of neoliberalism), class struggle fundamentally changes its form while the antagonisms of capitalism are heightened through, for example, the rapid expansion of the informal sector and imperialist super exploitation of the global south. As Horkheimer puts it,</p> <blockquote> <p>The development of capitalistic society according to its own inherent tendencies caused the progressive traits of competition to disappear. It severed the link between the needs of consumers and the profit-interest of the individual entrepreneur; it diminished the possibility, slight as it was, of an independent mind gaining access to an independent position; it reduced the number of relatively autonomous economic subjects, who by the very fact of that plurality had an interest in the functioning of general law and in its impartial administration. All this vanishes in the later stages of capitalism and allows society to revert to more direct forms of domination, which in fact never had been quite suspended.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>For the early critical theorists, the rapid immiseration of the working class during moments of crisis undermined the institutions that rationalized conditions of subordination. Which raises the possibility of revolutionary aspirations in the working class to change the very conditions of social reproduction, hence the “resolute will of progressive groups to win the victory over the naked force of arms”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 60</d-footnote> of the ruling classes. However, Horkheimer points out that it is equally possible for reactionary forces to co-opt the anxieties caused by crisis to reinstate “outmoded cultural apparatuses” with intensified disciplinary power.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 60</d-footnote> With the universalization of the impersonal mechanisms of capitalism (the interlocking forms of market, law and the state), capitalism provides movements for radical progress and regression into explicit forms of social domination. For Horkheimer (and the rest of the institution), the monopoly stage of Capitalism was already a regress into barbarism. Class struggle had largely been replaced by <em>class adaptation</em> as a result of the development of highly integrated monopoly society, the working class’s relationship to “the different capitalistic groups [is] no longer radically different from those prevailing among the capitalistic groups themselves.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> This does not imply that the possibility of radical change disappears, but rather shows the forms of consciousness that develop in monopoly capitalism.</p>]]></content><author><name>Re Tejus</name></author><category term="Racketology"/><category term="report"/><category term="write-up"/><category term="study"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part 1 on the Frankfurt School's racket concept]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">From Racket Theory to Real Domination</title><link href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_Camatte/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="From Racket Theory to Real Domination"/><published>2025-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_Camatte</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_Camatte/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>In the early 1940s, the Frankfurt School developed a body of work—most of it only published posthumously decades later—that has been given the name ‘racket theory.’ That body of work is the topic of Section 2 of this essay.</p> <p>The other subject of this essay is the French (post-) Marxist theorist Jacques Camatte. In what follows I will be mostly concerned with works dating to before Camatte’s turn towards holocaust denial,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> homophobia,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> transphobia,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> anti-abortion politics, and the <em>nouvelle droite</em>. With regard to the thematic material, I will be focused on drawing out the aspects of Camatte’s work that resonate with the Frankfurt School’s racket theory.</p> <p>While my verdict on Camatte is fundamentally unfavorable, I have tried my best to keep the text from degenerating into an ultra-left version of the classic “my dad can beat up your dad” argument. Also, I started writing this before Camatte died; it is not a theoretical obituary. Special thanks to James Crane for translating most of the quotations from Horkheimer.</p> <h2 id="the-frankfurt-schools-racket-theory">The Frankfurt School’s Racket Theory</h2> <p>Let’s begin our crash course in racketology with a long quotation from Otto Kirchheimer:</p> <blockquote> <p>The term racket is a polemical one. It reflects on a society in which social position has increasingly come to depend on a relation of participation, on the primordial effect of whether an individual succeeded or failed to “arrive”. Racket connotes a society in which individuals have lost the belief that compensation for their individual efforts will result from the mere functioning of impersonal market agencies. But it keeps in equal distance from, and does not incorporate, the idea of a society wherein the antagonism between men and inanimate elements of production has been dissolved in the image of a free association for the common use of productive forces. It is the experience of an associational practice which implies that neither the individual’s choice of an association nor the aims that the latter pursues are the result of conscious acts belonging to the realm of human freedom.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>This gives us much of what is fundamental in the Frankfurt School’s critical appropriation of the concept of the racket, but it is too matter-of-fact, too much of a finished product. To get at the origin of their racket theory, we have to turn to an essay by Adorno entitled “Reflections on Class Theory.”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Relevant for my purposes are the following three sentences, which form a dialectical series:</p> <ol> <li>“All history is the history of class struggles because it was always the same thing, namely, prehistory.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></li> <li>“In the image of the latest economic phase, history is the history of monopolies.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></li> <li>“In the image of the manifest act of usurpation that is practiced nowadays by the leaders of capital and labor acting in consort, it is the history of gang wars and rackets.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></li> </ol> <p>I do not have the space for an extended reading of Adorno’s “Reflections,” so I am just going to translate the essential theses above into the problematic we discover in the broader racket theory corpus:</p> <p>A. The equation history = class struggles = prehistory poses a challenge on the terrain of theory: to find unity in history with reference to future freedom (communism-as-society) by and while positing class struggle as its motor (communism-as-the-real-movement).<br/> B. The ascendance of monopolies that abrogate the principle of economic competition requires a rethinking of the concept of class because “the concept of class […] is modeled on the bourgeoisie itself. As the anonymous unity of the owners of the means of production and their various appendages, the bourgeoisie is the class par excellence.”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Now “the ruling class disappears behind the concentration of capital;”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> it consists of monopolists and monolith social capital. Problem (A) is further complicated. History is the history of monopolies. (Thus, pseudo-marxisms: Veblen, progressivism, social democracy, theoretical Popular Frontism, etc.)<br/> C. Finally, the homological hierarchies of domination present in organized labor and monopoly capital throw the destiny of the proletariat into question. The return of direct domination is complemented by a tendency towards ‘voluntary’ conformism. Freedom becomes a dirty word.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p> <p>The theory of rackets, imagined in this way as a fragmentary response to Adorno’s inaugural essay, is an answer to the question of how theory can maintain the core of historical materialism (A) while undergoing a fundamental rethinking of the concept of class (B) and class struggle (C).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> I lack the space to explain it below, but Camatte’s problematic is similar. Now for racket theory proper.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>In the fragment “Die Rackets und der Geist,” Horkheimer writes that the racket is the “basic form of domination.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> This is because class society is itself a racket: “‘Ruling class’ always means the structure of rackets on the basis of a determinate mode of production, so far as they simultaneously protect and suppress the lowest strata.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Or again: “The structure [of every ruling class in history] has been that of competing rackets.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p> <p>The use of the term racket was inspired by what the members of the Frankfurt School (and many others) saw as the increasing monopolization of the capitalist economy, a process that entailed corresponding changes in politics and culture. The tendency within capitalism towards concentration and centralization “allows society to revert to more direct forms of domination, which in fact never had been quite suspended.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>But the ruling class is not the only racket. Racket-style organization, according to Horkheimer, now also predominates in the labor movement. This is part of a wider historical tendency: “Under the pressure of the ruling class, people within the ruled class are forced to become rulers against those who are even more powerless. The oppressed themselves still become, through this mediation, the direct executioner of those further down.”<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> Part of a wider historical tendency, but not identical with it! Horkheimer is clear, albeit pessimistically so, about the specific historical potential of the proletariat in the fragment “Geschichte der amerikanischen Arbeiterschaft” :</p> <blockquote> <p>The historical course of the proletariat led to a crossroads: it could become a class or a racket. Becoming a ‘racket’ would have meant privileges within national borders, becoming a ‘class’ would have meant world revolution. Leaders have robbed the proletariat of this decision.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The resignation of the proletariat’s historic task by the official labor movement, which for Horkheimer was emblemized by the American Federation of Labor and the German Social Democrats, meant that a strong distinction had to be made between radical and reformist (actually conformist) forms of class struggle.</p> <p>In the foregoing passages, Horkheimer is referring to a particular meaning of racket, namely the protection racket. This interpretation agrees with Horkheimer’s earlier claim in “The End of Reason” that “Protection is the archetype of domination.”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> The unity of protection and domination is one of two essential unifying characteristics of the various social forms to which Horkheimer gives the name racket. Thus: “The most general category of functions practiced by groups is protection. Groups maintain the conditions for the continuation of the division of labor in which they have favored standing; they uphold and violently ward off changes that could endanger their monopoly. They are rackets.”<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p> <p>The other essential characteristic of the racket is its particularism: “Every racket conspires against spirit, and all conspire against, among one another. The reconciliation of universal and particular is immanent to spirit; the racket is their irreconcilable opposition, disguised by ideas of unity and community.”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Competitiveness and hostility grow out of this fundamental particularism.</p> <p>This leaves us with the question of what exactly the purpose of the racket is as a form of social organization. Kirchheimer provides a rather direct answer: for him, the aim of all so-called racketeers is the “establishment of domination over a segment of the process of production or distribution.”<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Horkheimer sometimes provides similarly broad qualifications (“to get as large a share of power over men, goods and services as possible”), but in other places he places a distinct emphasis on the sphere of distribution or circulation. For instance:</p> <blockquote> <p>The concept of racket therefore refers to the big as well as to the small units; they all struggle for as great a share as possible of the surplus value. […] Emphasis is to be laid on the fact that the role of a group in production though determining to a great extent its share of consumption, has been in class society a good strategic position for grasping as much goods and services as possible in the sphere of distribution.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The emphasis on distribution in passages like the one above suggests a close connection to Friedrich Pollock’s theory of state capitalism,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> and indeed most commentators have interpreted Horkheimer in this way. Such interpretations ignore Horkheimer’s strong criticism of Pollock’s theory in the fragment “Die Ideologie der Politik Heute.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Adorno was perhaps even more repulsed by Pollock’s theory of state capitalism, writing to Horkheimer that “a critique [of Pollock’s essay “State Capitalism”] that would express my view of the matter would have been psychologically beyond my control” and going on to request that Horkheimer completely rewrite it.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> In my opinion, the analyses of Franz Neumann’s <em>Behemoth</em> bear greater resemblance to (Adorno and) Horkheimer’s theory than do those of Pollock’s essays on state capitalism.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p> <p>In any case, the racket theory had a broader scope than the theory of state capitalism. Older forms of social organization were also castigated: the family is a racket, gender is a racket, and so are the initiatory communities of so-called “primitive tribes.” Thus, Horkheimer applied the concept in a transhistorical manner, but he had his reasons for doing so. As far as he was concerned, the concept was only thinkable in the first place with reference to modern rackets: “The modern concept [of the racket] serves to describe past social relations. ‘The anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the monkey.’”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> The racket-style organization is only boiled down to its essence in the modern racket.</p> <p>Horkheimer’s condemnation of rackets is wide-ranging, but it is not an attack on organization <em>as such</em> or even all organizations contemporaneous to his work. A handful of fragments and texts from the 1940s provide us with indications of what Horkheimer thought a revolutionary organization would look like. For starters, a non-racket organization in class society can only be a fighting organization “with its point directed upwards,” but such organizations “have no place in the established hierarchy, are without regular economic function, and, after periods of illegality, live on in revolutionary actions.”<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> Horkheimer had previously condemned the tendency of reformist opposition to become integrated into capitalism in “Authoritarian State,” writing that “Whatever seeks to extend itself under domination runs the danger of reproducing it.”<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p> <p>More concretely, Horkheimer was a proponent of workers’ council democracy.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> In the racket theory corpus, he and Adorno repeatedly assert that workers are capable of taking over and competently managing the present system of production.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> He closely read the articles on the Spanish Civil War that Karl Korsch sent him, and scattered positive references to the anarchists of Spain may indicate sympathy for Korsch’s argument that they were the successors of the revolutionary spirit of 1917.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p> <h2 id="camattes-theory-of-the-real-domination-of-capital">Camatte’s Theory of the Real Domination of Capital</h2> <p>Now I turn to summary and analysis of the relevant parts of Jacques Camatte’s oeuvre. I am concerned in particular with Series II of <em>Invariance</em> (i.e., the years 1971-1975), which is dominated in content by Camatte’s ambiguous rejection of most of Marxism (or “the theory of the proletariat” as he calls it).<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p> <p>Theory of the material community of capital and real domination. Camatte’s eccentric reading of texts such as the <em>Grundrisse</em> and “Results of the Immediate Process of Production” lead him to create two new and interrelated concepts to describe the present form of capitalism.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> The first is the <em>real domination of capital</em>, a ‘creative’ gloss on Marx’s abortive theory of the <em>real subsumption of labor under capital</em>. The real domination of capital refers to the domination of <em>the whole of society</em> by capital and the relegation of human existence to a mere moment in the valorization process. According to Camatte, this real domination grows out of the predominance of fixed capital and relative surplus value in the production process of capital—factors which increasingly render the proletariat secondary (if not irrelevant) to the production process.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> Domination of the proletariat in the production process by means of fixed capital is then extended to mastery of the entire valorization process including circulation and eventually the real domination of society as a whole. The second concept—the material community of capital—is closely related, but distinct. The material community of capital is what supplanted the human communities (<em>Gemeinwesen</em>) of pre-capitalist modes of production. Camatte once wrote a letter to his comrade Gianni Collu explaining the concept of <em>Gemeinwesen</em> or community; he wrote that it is “the substance of the social reality of humans” and “a superior unity above all the state-unities, above the unending mob of organizations;” individuals are mere accidents of this substance.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> The establishment of capital’s real domination went hand-in-hand with its constitution as the material community of humanity. The alienated human community (capitalism) is mediated and reproduced by the socio-material processes of capital, i.e. the production and exchange of commodities within the valorization process of capital. With the advent of capital’s real domination of humanity, the material community becomes autonomous and self-reproducing, as capital is now the ground for all social institutions (e.g., the state, etc.). Capital posits its own presuppositions and becomes the presupposition of humanity. What was previously mystification now becomes real and effective. Capital dispenses with gold and value and becomes its own tautologous representation.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p> <p>Capital has thus succeeded in “[absorbing] the movement that negates it, the proletariat,” and, consequently, “all forms of working-class political organization have disappeared.”<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> At the same time, capitalists are absorbed into the automatic functioning of capital. Class conflict therefore goes the way of the dodo and is replaced by inconsequential squabbles between the gangs/rackets/organizations/groups “which are the varied modes of being of capital.”<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> Camatte explains further: “This mode of being [the gang-racket] arises from the fact that capital can only valorize itself, and hence only exist and develop its being, if a particle of itself, now autonomized, confronts the whole of society, positing itself in relation to the total-socialized equivalent, capital. [Capital] needs this confrontation (competition, emulation) because it only exists through differentiation.”<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> It is unclear if Camatte came to the word ‘racket’ by himself or if he learned it from the Frankfurt School. The former case is very plausible, as most of the texts from the Frankfurt School that presaged Camatte’s new theoretical path vis-a-vis “rackets” would not be published for several years.</p> <p>The eclipse of the proletariat by capital had consequences for practice and organization. Camatte and Collu give two points of departure for future practice: “refuse to reconstitute a group, even an informal one” and “maintain a network of personal contacts with people having realized (or in the process of doing so) the highest degree of theoretical knowledge: antifollowerism, antipedagogy; the party in its historical sense is not a school.”<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> Camatte further spelled out the practical implications of “On Organization” in a 1970 letter to his comrades:</p> <blockquote> <p>…we could be a certain number of revolutionaries without forming a group, even informally (that is to say, non-structured), but evidently this is only possible tendentially, in the sense that it is only through theoretical activity that we can avoid the traps laid for us by capitalist society. In other words, we cannot be a group and still play a part in the unification of the class that must develop presently; this can only happen if we consider ourselves as the heart of the movement [!?]; if we do not become autonomous [s’autonomise]; if, therefore, we see ourselves as an element of the becoming-unification, not as an instrument, a means to bring it about. This is why there is no interior and exterior.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>This effectively put Camatte on a level with (or even below) the <em>attentistes</em> of the French councilist group Informations et Correspondances Ouvrières (ICO),<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> although the emphasis on theoretical activity—and the belief that this groupuscular theoretical activity is of world-historical importance—gives his take a distinctively Bordigist flair.</p> <p>Texts following “On Organization” have a somewhat softer position; Camatte even had some backhanded compliments for the French Maoist movement!<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> The change in tone was connected to his latest prophetic vision: “Since [May ‘68] there has begun inside the universal class […] a struggle which will lead to the revolutionization of this class and its constitution as a party-community, the first moment of its negation.”<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> The party (-community) of which Camatte speaks is the <em>historical party</em>, i.e. communism qua ‘the real movement.’ The editor-in-chief of <em>Invariance</em> saw the new organizations of the 1960s as momentary, fragmented expressions of the movement—already underway!—that would negate ‘the proletariat’ and unify the new ‘universal class’ (which includes the “middle classes”) en route to the “immediate triumph of communism.”<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p> <p>Once we get into <em>Invariance</em>’s third series, it becomes clear that after about 1973 Camatte broke with any and all remotely conventional ideas of revolution. “Resistance,” he writes, “is a disguised [form of] waiting, an unspoken hope that the world’s course may still change.”<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> Instead of resisting, we must “leave the world,” create “communist forms” and “new modes of action,” embrace non-violence, etc. “Men and women will come to realize that they themselves are the determining elements, and that they do not have to abdicate their power to the machine…”<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> Camatte’s thinking has reached complete tautology. There is no longer anything in it worth discussing.</p> <h2 id="remarks-in-place-of-a-conclusion">Remarks (In Place of a Conclusion)</h2> <p>The similarities between Horkheimer and Adorno’s theory and that of Camatte are striking. Furthermore, direct inspiration from the Frankfurt School is (probably) not the decisive factor in Camatte’s intellectual development—although surely there was some degree of it, especially in the 1970s. I consider both the Frankfurt School’s racket theory and Camatte’s work to be failed theoretical programs, albeit ones with rational kernels. However, I also think that the Frankfurt School’s failure is more compelling, interesting, and important.</p> <p>A key difference between the Frankfurt School and Camatte lies in their conceptions of reconciliation, utopia, and revolution. Camatte is harmonistic, whereas the Frankfurt School is therapeutic.</p> <p>Camatte’s elliptical descriptions of communism betray this harmonistic tendency. His basic stance is defined by the thesis that communism “is not a question of having or of doing, but of being.”<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> It “is not a new mode of production; it is the affirmation of a new community.”<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> These abstract-metaphysical theses contrast with the Frankfurt School’s indications of what communism would look like, which are generally negative.</p> <p>The harmonism is also present in his descriptions of revolution and transition. In the texts of <em>Invariance</em> Series I, the transition simply appears as a series of policies (all taken from Bordiga) easily enacted by the omnipotent class-party-state-community: abolition of the separation between economic enterprises, shortening of the working day, cessation of all commodity exchange, disalienation of labor, etc. To that extent, and only to that extent, the early Camatte is guilty of “[degrading] the revolution to mere progress.”<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> Subsequent treatments of the topic in Series II of <em>Invariance</em> degenerate into the fairytale prophecies summarized above. In Camatte’s mature work, the mechanical predictions of vulgar historical materialism—predictions which at least had the pretension of being scientific—are replaced by a willfully abstract belief in humanity. Despite the continuous and drastic changes in his theory, one never finds any trace of genuine autocritique in Camatte, only the mind-numbingly repetitious discourse of a pseudosagelike know-it-all. The puppet called “Gemeinwesen” is always supposed to win.</p> <p>The works of the Frankfurt School, by contrast, are suffused with the awareness that what has been lost can never be regained, not really.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> Even the dead are not safe from the enemy, and we have scarcely any idea what victory would look like. Thus Benjamin:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whoever wishes to know what the situation of a ‘redeemed humanity’ might actually be, what conditions are required for the development of such a situation, and when this development can be expected to occur, poses questions to which there are no answers. He might just as well seek to know the color of ultraviolet rays.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Benjamin’s polemical denial that we can have any idea of what redemption looks like is complemented by Adorno’s negative utopianism. The utopian can and does appear to us, but only fleetingly through reflection. Adorno’s descriptions of the good life are gnomically simple: it is “life without fear” or “a world in which no one goes hungry.” In Horkheimer’s early work, on the other hand, we find a certain cynicism and an awareness of the tragic element in everything. Revolution is nothing metaphysical; it is simply a matter of pain, hunger, and misery, of sufferings that can never be repaid. Socialism is not the perfection of humanity.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> Nor is either revolution or socialism a sure thing: “the experience of our generation,” Benjamin wrote, was that “capitalism will not die a natural death.”<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup></p> <p>Adorno and Horkheimer’s reflective meditations have a greater edificatory—and indeed truly <em>mystical</em>—effect than Camatte’s attempts at intuitive illumination, to say nothing of Benjamin’s Marxist mysticism.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> Camatte’s trajectory as a thinker is something like Benjamin’s intellectual life being played backwards. Instead of moving from mysticism to Marxism, it is his later works which are characterized by sophomoric metaphysics and infatuation with reactionary mystics (Klages, Bachofen, etc.).</p> <p>The most compelling part of Camatte’s work—the concept of the material community of capital—predates his turn away from Marxism. Again there is a striking resemblance to the Frankfurt School—here I refer to Adorno’s analysis of (capitalist) society as a reified totality.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> One of the key differences relates to <em>analysis</em> in its original sense: breaking things down. Camatte explicitly refused the possibility of this, claiming that capital has overridden its logical elements and presupposed categories (the commodity, value, money, labor, etc.). Conversely, Adorno tended to center the basic exchange relation, and hence the aforementioned elementary categories. (I think many people who take influence from Camatte actually interpret the material community concept with reference to the elementary concepts, hence in a Lukácsian-Adornian manner.) Camatte began with the real subsumption of labor within the immediate process of production and then extrapolated this into the real domination of humanity by capital, whereas Adorno, being more sociologically cautious, focused on the expansion of commodity fetishism to cover greater and greater parts of social life. In my opinion, the Lukács-Adorno approach has infinitely more analytical potency than Camatte’s deliberately flattened social ontology.</p> <p>As I said before, I believe that both theories are ultimately failures. The difference lies in what they offer as salvage for thinking, in the potential for a critical re-appropriation of their analysis. The Frankfurt School’s incomplete conversations about rackets offer more for this purpose than Camatte’s impenetrable monologue on real domination.<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Jacques Camatte, <a href="https://www.ilcovile.it/xenia/revueinvariance/evanescence.html">“Évanescence du mythe antifasciste”</a> (1982) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>Jacques Camatte, <a href="https://www.ilcovile.it/xenia/revueinvariance/amourcombinatoire.html">“Amour ou combinatoire sexuelle”</a> (1978) <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Jacques Camatte, <a href="https://libcom.org/article/interview-jacques-camatte-2019">“Interview with Cercle Marx”</a> (2019) <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>Otto Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty” in <em>The Journal of Politics</em>, May, 1944, Vol. 6, No. 2, 139-176; 161. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:5"> <p>Theodor Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942) in <em>Can One Live After Auschwitz?

Moreover, that the radicality of their work is validated in their apprehension it would be forgotten in the same dynamic stasis (<em>Sempre erranti e sempre qui!</em>)<d-footnote>Horkheimer: "The individual no longer has a personal history. Though everything changes, nothing moves. He needs neither a Zeno nor a Cocteau, neither an Eleatic dialectician nor a Parisian surrealist, to tell what the Queen in *Through the Looking Glass* means when she says, 'It takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place, or what Lombroso's madman expressed in his beautiful poem: *Noi confitti al nostro orgoglio / Come ruote in ferrei perni, / Ci stanchiamo in giri eterni, / Sempre erranti e sempre qui!*'' *Eclipse of Reason*. (Bloomsbury, 2013), 112.</d-footnote> which would re-engender the very need that first engendered it. To the extent early critical theory seems to us to have a tragic character, this does not derive from the fact it has largely been forgotten, but from the fact it is still needed at all. For us, as for the early critical theorists themselves, the enduring validity of the critical theory of society, of its critical diagnostic of capitalist society and its social theorists, is a bitter confirmation that its dream is still unrealized. Critical Theory is only right in a wrong world.</p> <p>Following recent scholarship on the origin and formation of critical theory (a period stretching from the late 1910s through the early 1940s, though we focus on the 1930s), our recovery takes its point of orientation from the intersection of two premises. First, early critical theory was—and can only be adequately understood and evaluated as—a development and extension of the Marxian critique of political economy, which inherited the impulses of dissident (and particularly councilist) communism. Second, the traditional, and still predominant, reception of early critical theory has not interpreted it as such given, on the one hand, the popular context, intellectual and political, in which it has been received since the student movements of the late 60s,<d-footnote>Cf. Chris O'Kane. "On Frankfurt School Critical Theory and Political Economy."

Noerr &amp; Ziege (Springer VS, Wiesbaden, 2019) 10-11.</d-footnote></p> <p>This esoteric form of early critical theory is configured by three elements: tactical self-censorship, esoteric technique, and the negative method of presentation required by the dialectical conception of the critique of political economy. To a much larger degree than has been appreciated, their esotericism can be explained by ‘tactical’ considerations of the benefits of implementing self-censorship protocols in the hostile, anti-communist conditions of their theoretical production in exile, as is especially evident from their correspondence. However, as an esoteric <em>technique</em>, it was more than a tactic. It was an expression of the refusal to capitulate in thought to those compromises required of them in fact.</p> <blockquote> <p>The Institute’s original organ of publication was the Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, which appeared in German from 1932-1939.

Author's translation.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In a particularly revealing letter to Horkheimer in late 1941, Adorno makes a ‘tactical’ recommendation to remove an explicit reference to Marx from a draft of an essay to appear in the ISR’s journal, providing three reasons: “Those in-the-know know it anyway, the others need not notice, and it should annoy Grossmann.”<d-footnote>Adorno to Horkheimer, 8/18/1941. *Max Horkheimer, Gesammelte Schriften, Volume 17*.

Stephen Eric Bronner &amp; Douglas Mackay Kellner (Routledge, 1989), 77-78</d-footnote>—and “<em>there is only one theory.</em>”</p> <blockquote> <p>What do we actually mean by “essence”? Even in Marx, the tension between essence and appearance is due to the fact that he sees society under the aspect of communism. (...) We formulate in the manner of Spinoza. The essence in appearance consists in a relationship of the phenomenon, what is given, to what is possible. There is only one theory.<d-footnote>Horkheimer [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12.* (1985), 523-524. Author's translation.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In addition to implementing protocols of tactical self-censorship under pressure and elaborating an esoteric technique in protest, the early critical theorists insist on a negative method of presentation derived from the conception of the <em>critique</em> inherent to the critique of political economy itself: “Marxist science constitutes the critique of bourgeois economy and not the expounding of a socialist one.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Authoritarian State" [1942], Trans. Peoples Translation Service in Berkeley and Elliott Eisenberg. *Telos* Spring 1973, No. 15 (1973); doi:10.3817/0373015003, 13.</d-footnote> Rather, “Marx (...) wrests from bourgeois society the standard of legitimacy it fashions for itself, shows it cannot fulfill this, and, at the same time, maintains such a standard as a negative expression of the right society,” the realization of which “would abolish this form of society itself.”<d-footnote>Adorno and Horkheimer [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 438.

The consistency of logical forms, the necessity of the dialectical deductions correspond here to the natural necessity with which economic principles prevail in the reality of this society.

Responding in kind, Parker challenges Marcuse’s transcendental-idealistic methodological presuppositions, according to which the task of the theorist is discovering the schematism through which the thought of a historical period is determined on the basis of an historical a priori set of conditions of possibility, which prevent Marcuse from fulfilling this desideratum. Instead, Parker argues for an alternative model for theorizing the social determination of thought: beginning from detail-oriented analysis of historical material, reconstruction of the asymmetric relations of reciprocal determination between changes in the economic base (broadly considered) and the philosophical-ideological superstructure, with a focus on the analysis of the role of class-situated subjective mediation in the translation of objective conditions into determinations of thought. The majority of the essay is a test of this model in the case of the emergence of the concept of essence in ancient Greece, which provides the basis for a criticism of competing accounts of the advent of philosophy in Greek antiquity offered by historians and the early critical theorists themselves (from Sohn-Rethel to Adorno).</p> <p>In “On the Falsity of Prevailing Ideas: The Concept of Ideology in Early Critical Theory,” Samuel J. Thomas argues for the importance of Horkheimer’s critique of Karl Mannheim’s <em>Ideology and Utopia</em> in the early 1930s for a <em>critical theory of ideology</em>.<d-footnote>For a supplementary précis of Mannheim's *Ideology and Utopia*, see Samuel J. Thomas, "Précis of Mannheim's Ideology and Utopia." CTWG Blog, November 12, 2024. &lt;https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2024/Mannheim/&gt;</d-footnote> Distinguishing between <em>Ideologietheorie</em> and <em>Ideologiekritik</em>, Thomas demonstrates that Horkheimer’s critique of the methodology of Mannheim’s ‘value-free’ ‘sociology of knowledge’ (<em>Wissenssoziologie</em>) turns on this distinction and, moreover, on the problematic and unreflective separation of these moments in Mannheim’s project. In the course of this reconstruction, Thomas develops a model for diagnosing the pitfalls of more contemporary, one-sided approaches to theories and critiques of ideology and argues that the singular difficulty of analyzing ideology under the conditions of capitalist social relations requires the adoption of a specific conception of the dialectical method. Presenting the unity of <em>Ideologietheorie</em> and <em>Ideologiekritik</em> in Horkheimer’s own work throughout the 1930s, in which ideology <em>theory</em> focuses on the functional role of ideology in relations of class domination and ideology <em>critique</em> focuses on the relation between ideology and totality (as well as ideological theories of ideology and totality), Thomas contextualizes Horkheimer’s own conception of ideology as self-contextualizing. This is required by the self-reflexive core of the critical theory of ideology, which Thomas calls the ‘double determination’ of any inquiry into ideology itself: the mode in which capitalist social totality determines the object of analysis and the subject of the researcher who seeks to offer a theory or critique of ideology. After exhibiting this approach in the case of Horkheimer’s own analysis of the bourgeois revolutionary in the figure of Tommaso Campanella (inter alia), Thomas concludes with polemical suggestions for the further development of the critical theory of ideology.</p> <p>In “Analytic Social Psychology as Critical Social Theory,” J.E. Morain recovers the early work of Erich Fromm, a foundational and unjustly neglected figure in accounts of the formation of early critical theory—specifically, the ISR’s project of developing an ‘analytic social psychology,’ which would provide the conceptual scaffolding of the group’s <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em> (1936) and, arguably, the framework and foci of the ‘socio-psychological’ approach to empirical research the ISR would use throughout the 1940s, culminating in <em>The Authoritarian Personality</em> (1950).<d-footnote>See Morain's recent report on research conducted at the Erich Fromm archive on the CTWG blog, which reconstructs the systematic, Marxian conception Fromm contributed to the ISR's *Studien über Autorität und Familie* (1936): "The Origins of Studien über Autorität und Familie." CTWG Blog, April 27, 2024. &lt;https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2024/origins_of_the_family/&gt;</d-footnote> In this essay, Morain begins with a critical survey of secondary literature on Fromm’s contribution to ‘The Frankfurt School,’ which, on the whole, has read Fromm from a ‘standpoint of redemption’ that assumes the condemnation of his work from the outset. In Morain’s reconstructive-reparative approach, Fromm is restored to his role as the author of the interdisciplinary synthesis of historical materialism and classical psychoanalysis that underlies the ISR’s famous ‘Freudo-Marxism’: explanations of the large-scale social phenomena posited by historical materialism on the basis of the psychic dynamics of individuals as conceived by Freudian psychoanalysis. Fromm’s approach is shown to outfit early critical theory with the <em>‘microfoundations’</em> of their conception of social reproduction. In explicit and militant opposition to any transhistorical theory of human motivation or ‘interests’ in the life of society, as well as to the vulgar Marxist theory of ‘reflection,’ Fromm reorients social psychology to an analysis of the <em>mediation</em> of economic ‘base’ and ideological ‘superstructure,’ social existence and social consciousness, by the network of institutions in which the psychic character of individuals is formed—for the sake of producing functional, capitalist subjects—in the course of capitalist social reproduction as a whole. In particular, Fromm’s focus is on the <em>family</em> as a complex of mediations, which serves, Fromm argues, as the primary agent of socialization and influence on the social formation of psychic character-structure. Morain differentiates Fromm’s particular appropriation psychoanalytic theory from that of Freudian orthodoxy and develops Fromm’s distinctive conception of ‘analytic social psychology’ in a reconstruction of three basic concepts: social-psychic ‘cement’ (distinct from ‘ideology’ proper), ‘the psychic structure of society,’ and a unique concept of ‘ideology’ in social reproduction, which, in conjunction, provide the elements for Fromm’s social-psychological ‘crisis’ theory, according to which, as Fromm puts it in his inaugural essay in the <em>ZfS</em>, “the libidinal energies” which comprise the social-psychic cement “no longer serve the preservation of the society, but contribute to the development of new social formations. They cease to be ‘cement,’ and turn into dynamite.”<d-footnote>Fromm, "The Method and Function of an Analytic Social Psychology: Notes on Psychoanalysis and Historical Materialism" [1932]. *The Essential Frankfurt School Reader*.

"ZfS in English." CTWG Blog, November 6, 2024. &lt;https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2023/ZfS/&gt;</d-footnote> Namely: how can we account for the moral dimension of the Marxist materialist’s critique of morality? Notwithstanding the critique of ‘value-free’ social theory in early critical theory as a whole, and in Horkheimer’s work in particular, Horkheimer himself criticizes moral conflicts, particularly in moral philosophy, for failing to recognize that they occur in the context of a world that is itself wrong, a society that is itself unjust. Planas Balduz begins here, interrogating the perspective from which the value judgment which assesses the world qua society as a totality has been—and, perhaps, ought to be—made. In the course of the essay, Planas Balduz reconstructs the method with which Horkheimer traces the categories of ‘materialism,’ ‘morality,’ and ‘metaphysics’ proper to each of these fields of judgment back to the constitutive, modern tension between ‘subjective’ and ‘social’ value judgments about what is considered socially and personally unbearable. In the above-mentioned foundational essays on Marxist materialism, Horkheimer argues that, and shows us how, sociology and positivist philosophy repeat this core tension through the rejection of value judgement, which binds them to their negative doubles—idealist moral philosophy of unconditional obligation and proto-totalitarian romanticism of unconditional self-determination. It is precisely because of the power of Horkheimer’s critique of ‘value-free’ social theory and science which, Planas Balduz concludes, compels us to pose two questions. First, given Horkheimers concern in these essays with questions of the individual in relation to the moral law, how can we relate his arguments to the position of the individual relative to the ‘second nature’ laws of the capitalist market? Or: in what sense is Horkheimer’s ‘materialist’ critique of morality materialist? Second, to the extent that materialism requires a critique of morality, how can we reconcile this with the need to confront the a-moral morality in the critique of socialism in neoliberal social thought? Or: does Horkheimer’s moral anti-moralism have its own negative double in the hegemonic discourse of the present?</p> <p>In “On the Social Situation of Adorno’s Critical Music Theory,” Zach Loeffler restores Adorno’s eccentric musical perspective in the early 1930s—represented in particular by his first published contribution to early critical theory in the ISR’s orbit, “On the Social Situation of Music” (1932)—to its own ‘social situation’: namely, as an effort to elaborate the theoretical consequences of direct proletarian action and worker militancy in the first years of the Weimar Republic, its brutal suppression, and its ongoing structural absence for a critical theory of artistic production. In the course of the essay, Loeffler reinterprets “Social Situation” through the late self-critique Adorno provides of the essay more than three decades later, reconstructing the re-articulation of Adorno’s theory of music through the reconfiguration of several ambivalences through which his earlier theoretical perspective develops. In the course of this reinterpretation, Adorno’s late musical theory is itself read in light of the young Adorno’s project of thinking music in its total ‘social situation.’ The perspective which emerges is as follows: if music is to do justice to the promise of fulfillment made by bourgeois art, then it must embody the truth of the untruth of capitalism and in turn something of a truly free, non-instrumental sociality bridging the gap between theory and revolutionary praxis; and if music is to do these things, then its material must be rationalized past the point where class society necessarily cuts rationalization short, a process which renders music socially mute and functionless. The musical rearticulation of Adornos critical theory therefore makes legible the Marxism of "consummate negativity" and maximalist communism that form the crux of his work, rendering concrete the negotiation of the problem of freedom vis-à-vis theory and praxis in the face of intractable social compulsion and the concrete possibility of realizing its mirror image.</p> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Adorno, Theodor W. “Traditionelle und kritische Theorie”. <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> 6 (1937)(2): 245–294. doi:10.5840/zfs19376265.</p> <p>———. “Double review of Wahl, Jean Etudes Kierkegaardiennes Lowrie, Walter The Journals of Soren Kierkegaard”. <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> 8 (1939)(1/2): 232–235.</p> <p>———. <em>Hegel: Three Studies</em>.

Robert C. Tucker (Norton, 1978), 84.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>I’ve never read an account of the socio-historical determination of philosophy that fully satisfied me. There always seems to be some level of mediation missing, some level of distortion or sleight of hand at play in the explanatory framework. This problem really crystallized for me when I read and presented on Marcuse’s essay “The Concept of Essence” with the Critical Theory Working Group last fall. The way it subsumed the history of philosophy under its gaze thrilled me at the same time as it set off alarm bells in the back of my mind. Its attack on the ahistorical pretensions of philosophy appealed to the historical materialist in me and its systematic account of Marxism as a theory of essence appealed to the philosopher in me. At the same time, I had a nagging sense that something was amiss on both counts, and I couldn’t really see how it all fit together. As I continued to engage with it, I began to suspect that the specter of totalization, which had been part of the essay’s initial appeal, covered over a number of confusions and deficiencies that prevented it from fulfilling the promises that I had originally read into it. These promises are of 1) a historical materialist account of the origins and development of the concept of essence that grounds both in the social conditions from which they arose and 2) a marxist theory of essence that facilitates the project of revolutionary praxis in the present day. I still believe that attempting to fulfill these promises is a worthwhile project, although one that (perhaps predictably) cannot be completed within the bounds of a single essay. With that in mind, I will focus here on laying the groundwork for that larger project, using Marcuse’s essay as a jumping-off point for developing my own historical materialist account of the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in Ancient Greece.<d-footnote>I do not mean to claim that this emergence represented the absolute origins of the concept of essence in a world historical sense, but rather to take it as an example of the emergence of that concept from out of a milieu in which it had previously been absent (and one that appears to have been foundational for the tradition we refer to as Western or European philosophy).</d-footnote></p> <p>In Part 1, I will begin with a critical examination of Marcuse’s account of the historical development of essence and the reasons for its failure to realize what it set out to achieve. I will argue that the most important of these reasons involve a formalist interpretive apparatus and the subsumption of the historical materialist elements in his work under an idealist philosophy of history, which lead him to neglect the concrete socio-historical conditions under which the concept of essence emerged in Ancient Greece. After that I will address the work of Alfred Sohn-Rethel, which bears some superficial similarities to the investigation undertaken here, but shares many of the problems that plagued Marcuse’s account, and use the discussion of his work as an opportunity to further distinguish my project from both of theirs.</p> <p>In Part 2, I will begin my reconstruction of the social determination of the emergence of the concept of essence in Ancient Greece, starting with the pre-history of the concept of essence. This will involve 1) an examination of what I will call the bardic conception of truth and its situation within an earlier mode of production centered around the warrior-aristocracy depicted in the Homeric epics 2) an account of how the reciprocal dynamic of commercialization and the centralization of slavery within the mode of exploitation, along with changes in the practice of warfare, created a crisis of the traditional warrior aristocracy and the mode of production centered on them, which set the stage for the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in Pre-Socratic Monism (PSM) and 3) a concluding examination of the works Theognis of Megara and the transitional conception of truth developed in them, which bears marks of both the bardic conception that preceded it and the concept of essence that followed it.</p> <p>In Part 3, I will turn to PSM itself and its relation to the changes described in the preceding section. First, I will offer an examination and critique of Richard Seaford’s account of the origins of PSM and its relation to the money form as a result of what he calls “unconscious cosmological projection.” Then, I will elucidate my own positive account of the origins and development of PSM in terms of its ideological function in response to the aristocratic and social crises of the Archaic period and the inability of its proponents to recognize the latent content of the money form as an externalization of the total social labor that posits both the equality of labor and its thoroughgoing interdependence.</p> <p>Finally, in Part 4 I will discuss the methodological, historical and practical implications of the preceding reconstruction, with an eye to the larger project set out in this introduction.</p> <p>There are also two appendices attached to this essay, the first of which details the methodological background that underlies the arguments presented in the body of the essay, and the second of which provides a more concrete reconstruction of the relevant historical developments that took place between the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces and the consolidation of the <em>poleis</em> in the Archaic. The second in particular is important for putting the developments discussed in Part 2 in their proper perspective and justifying a number of the claims made there.</p> <h2 id="1-the-problem-of-historical-reconstruction">1. The Problem of Historical Reconstruction</h2> <h3 id="marcuses-position-11">Marcuse’s Position (1.1)</h3> <p>My beginning this piece with an examination of Marcuse’s essay “The Concept of Essence” is in some sense a nod to the biographical origins of the investigation I am undertaking here. It was his essay that sent me down the path that culminated in the writing of the essay you are reading now. So, if you’ll allow me to be a little loose with my terms, beginning in this way can be seen as an attempt to leave somewhat ajar the doors of the hidden abode of production whose product stands before you in the form of a finished work; Or, in a more Hegelian vein, to lay bare the process of mediation without which the result would appear as a bare immediacy stripped of its full meaning and conceptual content. To properly elucidate the concepts developed here, the conceptual and methodological problems in Marcuse’s essay that served as their origin must themselves be taken back up into their exposition, and so I must begin with an account of Marcuse’s position. At the same time, it should be understood that the primary purpose of this essay is not the evaluation of that position, but rather the development of an account of the emergence of the concept of essence and its socio-historical determination, which, despite inheriting its object and certain animating problems from Marcuse’s account, rests on different principles, principles that could be said to represent the determinate negation of those that Marcuse’s essay is founded on. In this sense, Marcuse’s position is only a starting point, but it is nevertheless an essential starting point.</p> <p>At first glance, Marcuse’s essay has the appearance of offering a historical materialist account of the emergence and development of the concept of essence (and to some extent it does do so, as we’ll see below). It is framed as an attempt to show how “even [the] loftiest conceptions of philosophy are subject to historical development,” and how “so much of men’s real struggles and desires went into the metaphysical quest for an ultimate unity, truth, and universality of Being that they could not have failed to find expression in the derived forms of the philosophical tradition.”<d-footnote>Herbert Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," in _Negations: Essays in Critical Theory_, trans. Jeremy Shapiro (Mayfly Books, 2009), 31.</d-footnote> This suggests that the project Marcuse is pursuing is an attempt to demonstrate the validity of the basic historical materialist postulate that “it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_, trans. S.W. Ryazanskaya (Progress Publishers, 1977), Preface.</d-footnote> But, upon closer examination, this framing already reveals the deficiencies of his project from the perspective of a genuine, dialectical conception of historical materialism.</p> <p>The first way in which it does so is by restricting the scope of the socio-historical determination of thought. In order to account for the apparent invariance of the <em>content</em> of the concept of essence, which he glosses as “the abstraction and isolation of the one true Being from the constantly changing multiplicity of appearances,” Marcuse argues that it is the “<em>position and function</em> [of such concepts] within philosophical systems” [italics mine] that is subject to change.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 31.</d-footnote> It is therefore to the position and function of the concept of essence that we should look to understand its socio-historical determination. But, this division between an invariant content and a historically determined position and function already concedes too much to the idealist position Marcuse is trying to argue against, abstracting and isolating the content of the concept from the realm of historical explanation and positing it as an eternal, transcendent content whose origins are either obscure or unknowable.</p> <p>The obscurity of the origins of this transcendent content creates a number of problems for the beginning of Marcuse’s historical account. Without the ability to give a historical explanation of the origins of the content of the concept of essence, he is forced to posit its emergence as an external bringing-together of independently pre-existing determinations (or of the philosophical problems that underlie them).<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 32.</d-footnote> He argues that it is the bringing-together of the “epistemological” determinations of unity, universality and abstraction with the determination of truth—understood as distinguishing between hierarchically ordered levels of reality—that provides essence with its “critical and ethical elements” and so with its primary function within Plato’s philosophy, which is to establish a “critical gap” between what is and what could or should be.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33. As we shall see in Part 2, there is a notion of truth that pre-exists the emergence of the concept of essence, but it is not until that emergence occurs that it takes on the determination Marcuse attributes to it.</d-footnote> He doesn’t explain where these determinations, or the problems that form their “philosophical substratum,” themselves arise from, or why they are brought together to form the concept of essence, outside of some quasi-mystical and ultimately tautological talk of a “quest for the unity and universality of Being in view of the multiplicity and changeability of beings.”<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 32--3.</d-footnote> It is as if, for Marcuse, the Ancient Greeks already had a notion of essence preconceived in their heads before they went searching for it.</p> <p>If there <em>is</em> an invariance in certain elements of the concept of essence, or of any other metaphysical category—which does have a certain plausibility given a cursory look at the history of philosophy—then that invariance must itself be understood historically. First, it must be established (which it isn’t clear to me has been done, whether by Marcuse or anyone else), and then it must be traced to its roots in the socio-historical conditions of the various periods in which it can be observed, whether this means finding some common condition, or set of conditions, that explain its persistence, or providing an explanation of how a set of relatively contingent circumstances led to its maintenance under different modes of production despite lacking such a common basis.<d-footnote>I will suggest a few possibilities on this score below, such as that it is existence of social presuppositions of the process of production that underlies a certain continuity in the determination of truth, and the monetization of these presuppositions that does the same with continuities in the determination of essence, but these are provisional hypotheses derived from the concrete historical material, and requiring confirmation from further historical investigation, rather than theoretical or methodological assumptions brought to that material on the basis of high-level generalization.</d-footnote> Not only that, but the question of what exactly is invariant in that concept, if anything is, must remain open throughout the investigation. Whether it is actually the determinations of unity, universality, abstraction, and truth that form the invariant content of the concept of essence, or even whether it is in terms of content that the concept is invariant, are questions whose answers, like those to the question of invariance itself, cannot be assumed from the start but must be found, tested, modified, and retested in the material itself as the process of investigation proceeds.</p> <p>Additionally, this obscurity about origins begins to give us a sense of why there is no historical account of the social conditions of Classical Athens in Marcuse’s essay, despite his claim that that is where the concept of essence first emerged. The ahistorical nature of the content allows it to appear as a pure origination, one that seems to have been completely contingent and in no need of explanation. Still, even the supposedly ahistorical nature of the content does not fully explain the complete lack of socio-historical grounding that we are discussing. For example, one would expect the position and function of the Platonic concept of essence to still be subject to such grounding given Marcuse’s framing, but this is conspicuously absent from his exposition.</p> <p>The reason for this has to do with the deeper set of deficiencies revealed by Marcuse’s framing, which themselves have to do with the overall interpretive apparatus of the essay, which is over-reliant on “expressive causality” or homology and ultimately subsumes its historical materialist elements under an idealist philosophy of history.<d-footnote>For an overview of the Althusserian critique of expressive causality and the subsumption of it under the critique of homology, see Fredric Jameson, _The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act,_ (Cornell University Press, 1981), 23--43. For the general conception of allegory and interpretive levels on which this analysis is based, see Jameson, _The Political Unconscious,_ 29--32.</d-footnote> This appeared in the framing in terms of the <em>expression</em> of real human struggles and desires “in the derived forms of the philosophical tradition,” but its centrality to Marcuse’s analysis is demonstrated much more clearly by taking the interpretive apparatus as a whole as our object of examination. In this schema, the text of the history of philosophy is read on multiple levels, each of which can be categorized according to the primary philosophical methodology that is operative in it.</p> <p>We can call the first level quasi-Heideggerian because it is where the lingering influence of a Heideggerian problematic—recall that Marcuse was a student of Heidegger—is most prominent. It is also the level on which the bulk of the interpretation of Plato’s concept of essence is conducted. At this level, Marcuse reads Plato’s concept of essence according to an altered version of the Heideggerean conception of metaphysics in which the primarily question is of the relationship between Being and beings, a relationship that is made possible by a transcendence of the “facticity” of beings.<d-footnote></d-footnote><d-footnote>See Martin Heidegger, "What is Metaphysics?," ed. Dieter Thomä, trans. Ian Moore and Gregory Fried, _Philosophy Today_ 62, no. 3 (2018): 733--51, &lt;https://doi.org/10.5840/philtoday20181024232&gt;, for the conception of metaphysics referenced in this paragraph, especially 739--44. This focus on transcendence also explains the transcendent character of the "common content," which encompasses the key determinations that attach to Being in opposition to beings, and so must be subject to the transcendence that produces this division.</d-footnote> For Marcuse, this transcendence does not take place on the basis of the “nihilation of the nothing,” but instead on the basis of the “critical consciousness of bad facticity, of unrealized potentialities.”<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33. For the "nihilation of the nothing," see Heidegger, "What is Metaphysics?," 740.</d-footnote> How the badness of facticity or the awareness of those unrealized potentialities is established for consciousness is not clarified, but presumably it has something to do with the seemingly inherent “quest for the ultimate unity, universality and truth of Being” and the “struggles and desires” that went into it, which formed a part of the framing discussed above. This ungrounded connection of Being to “authenticity” or potentiality, to “what should and can be,” provides the interpretive code on the basis of which the changing function of the concept of essence in the other historical examples is understood, and on which the connection to the next two levels is established.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33.</d-footnote></p> <p>We can call the second level the historical materialist level because it operates on the basis of the concept of the mode of production, although it does so according to an economically determined expressive causality that might incline us to label it “vulgar” historical materialism. This is the level at which the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence is read on the basis of changes to its position and function. It is this level of interpretation that generates the most interesting insights in the historical section of the essay, despite the limits of its expressive mechanism. In each case, changes in the function of the concept of essence are read first in terms of the division set up on the first level between bad facticity and potentiality, as embodying, distorting, displacing or eliminating the “critical gap” between them that was established in the the case of Plato, and then reread in terms of the homology between these changes and changes in the configuration of the forces and relations of production.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 34--7. For example, the positing of an absolute separation and externality between the two sides in the Medieval concept is understood as an expression of the relations of personal domination that characterized the feudal mode of production, and the subjectivization and displacement of the Cartesian concept of essence into the realm of logic and epistemology is understood as an expression of the individualization and (fetishized) subjection of those individuals to the conditions of production characteristic of the capitalist mode of production.</d-footnote> This order of operations also helps explain the lack of an account of the social determination of the Platonic concept of essence, which sets the baseline on which this second level of interpretation relies, and so falls outside of its purview.</p> <p>The third level can be labeled the quasi-Hegelian or idealist level because it operates on the basis of the concept of freedom, building on the readings of the previous two levels and rereading them in terms of freedom in order to construct a teleological metanarrative that resembles the Hegelian philosophy of history in its broad outlines. In this metanarrative, the “interest of freedom” is seen as the originating impulse and inner essence of the development of philosophy, and Marxism, or the “materialist doctrine of essence,” represents the culmination of that development insofar as it takes as its object the actualization of freedom—which has been made into a <em>real possibility</em> by the social conditions of the modern era.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 48--9, 56, and 60.</d-footnote> It is on this third level that the grounding of the connection between true Being and potentiality that was missing from the perspective of the first level takes place. We can now see that the “interest of freedom” is what establishes the badness of facticity and the conscious awareness of unrealized potentiality, and so makes possible the fundamental metaphysical division between Being and beings on which Marcuse’s interpretation of the concept of essence is based. It is able to do so because, as the origin and inner essence of the concept of essence, it is posited as implicitly containing the seeds of the whole development in-itself by the meta-narrative constructed through the interpretive apparatus. This determination by the interpretive apparatus further disincentivizes any investigation of the origins or socio-historical determination of the Platonic concept of essence because such investigation might disturb its function as a pure origin and inner essence of the development as a whole.</p> <p>It is the idealist philosophy of history constructed by the third level, and its subsumption of the historical materialist interpretation, based on the concept of the mode of production, under itself, that forms the most objectionable part of Marcuse’s overall position and causes the most distortion of both the historical material and the project of historical explanation itself. At the same time, even without that subsumption, Marcuse’s reliance on homology would have limited his ability to properly explain the socio-historical emergence and development of the concept of essence, even according to the determinations of the “materialist doctrine of essence” that he himself set out in the latter half of his essay.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 50--64.</d-footnote> In this latter section, he paints a more adequate picture of the principles of historical materialism, although they are still colored by their situation within the idealist and expressive interpretive frameworks of the overall exposition, and so they must be evaluated on a case by case basis as to their usefulness for our project.<d-footnote>See Appendix 1 for a discussion of some of the relevant principles.</d-footnote> Similarly the conclusions drawn must be called into question and reevaluated on the basis of concrete historical investigation.</p> <p>To avoid the problems that prevented Marcuse from developing an adequate account of the socio-historical determination of essence, our investigation must rest on a thoroughly different methodological foundation from his—one whose basic impulses arise from the determinate negation of the abstract transcendence, formalism and idealist philosophy of history that subsumed and restricted the historical materialist elements that gave Marcuse’s essay its original appeal. This means starting with the concrete socio-economic conditions themselves that gave rise to the concept of essence and any antecedents it may have had, rather than starting from presupposed conceptual determinations of that concept and interpreting them on the basis of a teleological metanarrative or philosophy of history.<d-footnote>My research has led me to locate this emergence not with Platonic theory of Forms, but with the substance monism of the early Pre-Socratic philosophers.</d-footnote> At the same time, it also means understanding those conditions in the context of a total social process centered around the mode(s) of production of concrete social formations and its transformation over time, and giving explanatory priority to the broadly economic elements that provide its foundation, while also respecting the relative autonomy of its various structural elements.<d-footnote>For a more detailed exposition of what I mean by the broadly economic and its foundational place in the overall mode of production, see Appendix 1.</d-footnote> Clearly, this remains an interpretive scheme. It could not be otherwise. But it is one that is not centered on the <em>expression</em> of the content of one level in the content of another level, or on the subordination of the whole interpretive apparatus under the determinative closure of a master code, but rather on the reciprocal determination of relatively autonomous elements. Finally, it involves an active and dynamic suspension of the presuppositions we all bring into historical interpretation in favor of a dialectical surrender to the object, but one which does not entail avoiding the responsibility of simultaneously <em>thinking</em> that object.<d-footnote>For more on this process of active surrender to the object, see Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, _Science of Logic,_ ed. and trans. George di Giovanni (Cambridge University Press, 2015), 37 (21.43) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, _Phenomenology of Spirit,_ trans. A.V. Miller (Oxford University Press, 2013), 3.</d-footnote> Taken together, these form the basic impulses that animate the conception of historical materialism I develop in this study. A more detailed elaboration of this conception can be found in Appendix 1, but, as Hegel reminds us, the true elaboration can only be found in the unfolding of the project as a whole.<d-footnote>Hegel, _Phenomenology of Spirit,_ 1--4.</d-footnote></p> <h3 id="sohn-rethel--historical-materialism-12">Sohn-Rethel &amp; Historical Materialism (1.2)</h3> <p>Another prominent Marxist figure who has attempted to address the social determination of Ancient Greek philosophy is Alfred Sohn-Rethel. In his book <em>Manual and Intellectual Labor</em> Sohn-Rethel, like Marcuse, attempts to construct a grand historical narrative that explains the origins of a central feature of bourgeois thought—this time the epistemological foundations of “scientific cognition” as a whole and trace it back to its socio-historical foundations, which he locates in the “exchange abstraction” and, more generally, in the division between manual and intellectual labor. Also like Marcuse, Sohn-Rethel does this in order to say something about the overcoming of capitalism, this time in terms of the overcoming of said division between manual and intellectual labor, rather than in terms of the realization of freedom. In examining the work of Sohn Rethel, we will find that it is plagued by many of the same problems as Marcuse’s attempt. Our old friends formalism, homology, transcendence and idealism will all rear their heads once again, although in enough of a different manner as to remain instructive. If nothing else, this examination will serve to differentiate the methodological principles at work in this essay and the questions it attempts to answer from those of a superficially similar, but fundamentally different project that it might be associated with.</p> <p>The first point to make about <em>Manual and Intellectual Labor</em> is that despite its historical materialist dressing, Sohn-Rethel’s project is completely enveloped by the Kantian problematic it takes as its object of critique. He starts by saying that he accepts Kant’s premise that “the principles of knowledge fundamental to the quantifying sciences cannot be traced to the physical and sensorial capacity of experience.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor: A Critique of Epistemology_, trans. Martin Sohn-\ Rethel (Haymarket Books, 2021), 31.</d-footnote> But, like many before him, he is unsatisfied with the way Kant grounds this division between the <em>a priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em> in the transcendental unity of apperception, which is itself presented as an ungrounded source of “transcendental spontaneity.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor_, 31--2.</d-footnote> He argues that the fault in Kant’s project lies in his unwillingness to pursue his inquiry to the point of locating a “historical origin of our logical ability to construct mathematical hypotheses and the elements contributing to them.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 31--2. This reduction of all the content of the Kantian a priori to a mathematical basis most likely rests on a common faulty interpretation of the role of math in Kant's system (one typically derived from a reading of Kant's analytic presentation of the apriority of space as the form of outer intuition in the _Prolegomena_ which ignores the synthetic presentation of the apriority of space in the _Critique_). For a critique of this interpretation see Lisa Shabel, "Kant's 'Argument from Geometry,' " _Journal of the History of Philosophy_ 42, no. 2 (2004): 195--215, &lt;https://doi.org/10.1353/hph.2004.0034&gt;. This reduction is characteristic of Sohn-Rethel's presentation, which almost exclusively focuses on the quantitative and mathematical elements of philosophical and scientific cognition, which allows him to reduce thought, or "abstract intellect", to a form more easily assimilable to the abstract quantitative determinations of the "exchange abstraction."</d-footnote> His project in <em>Intellectual and Manual Labor</em> is to show that this historical origin lies in the “exchange abstraction” which becomes “converted into the conceptual structure of the abstract intellect.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor_, 57.</d-footnote> In conceiving his project this way, Sohn-Rethel retains the Kantian conception of scientific cognition—which is a product of determinate circumstances corresponding to a specific phase of the capitalist mode of production (and of the development of science)—and reifies it as the transcendental structure of “abstract intellect” and scientific thinking in general. Without going into the details of the many distortions of Marx’s analysis of the commodity form that result from this, I think it is sufficient here to say that this leads him into a formalism that is similar to Marcuse’s insofar as his appropriation of both Marx and the historical evidence are always already structured by this presupposition.<d-footnote>Some telling examples of this are Sohn-Rethel's dismissal of value as having "no thought content of its own, no definable logical substance" and "bearing no inherent reference to labor" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 40--1), his dismissal of the importance of the landed aristocracy and overemphasis on the role of circulation as the primary source of wealth in Archaic and Classical Greece, along with his characterization of this circulatory wealth as "merchants and users capital" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 83 &amp; 85), and his claim that the exchange abstraction is founded on "social postulates" and thus the concepts derived from it are normative and able to assume an independent logical existence separated from "statements of fact" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 56--7). In all of these cases, the evidence drawn upon is distorted in order to strengthen the isomorphism between commodity exchange (and the societies in which it took place) and the Kantian structure of cognition as divided between _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ (and the capitalist relations of production under which it was formulated).</d-footnote></p> <p>In addition to the formalism of his ahistorical conception of abstract intellect, Sohn-Rethel’s Kantian problematic also leads him to to formulate his conception of “the exchange abstraction” and its “laws” or “formal structure” on the basis of its necessary conditions of possibility. At first, he attempts to give his derivation of the structuring concepts of abstract intellect a materialist veneer by arguing that they derive from the <em>act</em> of exchange in its opposition to the <em>act</em> of use. But, as Jameson reminds us, historical materialism “does not assert the primacy of matter so much as it insists on an ultimate determination by the mode of production,” a reminder which equally applies to activity abstracted from its mode of production as it does matter.<d-footnote>Jameson, _The Political Unconscious_, 45</d-footnote> It also gradually becomes clear that it is not the act of exchange itself so much as the “social postulates” or “fictions” that underlie the “exchange abstraction (such as the postulate that “no physical change should occur in the commodities” during the act of exchange) that provide the actual basis on which the concepts are derived and “converted” into philosophical concepts. These postulates are conceived as having nothing to do with “statements of fact,” but rather, “are norms which commodity exchange has to obey to be possible.”<d-footnote>For the elements of the exchange abstraction as social postulates and conditions of the possibility of the act of exchange, as well as their fictional character, see Sohn-Rethel, *Intellectual and Manual Labo*r, 56--7 and 45, respectively. He does seem to recognize the incompatibility of this idealist procedure with his purported materialism in places, such as when he tries to reground the postulate of exemption from material change in human action by saying that "changes caused by human beings which infringe this postulate are outlawed by the police authority presiding in the market," but it is unclear who or what this "police authority" is or whether it corresponds to an actual and invariant condition of commodity exchange, and so falls flat.</d-footnote> It should be clear to anyone who has read the first chapter of <em>Capital</em> that this has nothing to do with the form-analysis undertaken by Marx there, in which it is the <em>relationship</em> established between two commodities in the act of exchange—in which one commodity is posited as the material embodiment of the value of the other commodity, which is itself thereby posited as having a value independent of its own material body and qualitative existence—that posits value as an abstract determination of the commodity, not any social postulates that function as transcendental conditions of the possibility of that act.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, _Capital: A Critique of Political Economy_, vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes (Penguin, 1990), 139--54.</d-footnote> Once again, we see that it is the relationship of reciprocal determination in which elements stand with respect to each other that forms the basis of historical materialist explanation, rather than reliance on a transcendent(al) content determined by a necessity that stems from the presuppositions of the theorist.</p> <p>Neither does “the physical act of transfer,” which Sohn-Rethel puts forward as the pseudo-materialist base upon which these social postulates are supposed to operate, play any part in Marx’s analysis of the commodity form.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 23.</d-footnote> It is this pseudo-materialist base that is critical in enabling the “conversion” of the concepts derived from the social postulates into concepts of philosophical or scientific cognition that take nature as their object. Sohn-Rethel argues that it is through the operation of these postulates in the “physical act of transfer”, that “the negation of the natural and material physicality [of the act itself] constitutes the positive reality of the abstract social physicality of the exchange process,” which thereby constitutes “a kind of abstract nature.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 47</d-footnote> It is this combination of the abstraction derived from the social postulates and the physicality of the act of exchange that allows the “conversion” into philosophical-scientific concepts to happen and establishes the validity of these concepts in their reference to nature.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 58</d-footnote></p> <p>It is here that we can finally begin to understand the otherwise strange and highly idiosyncratic decision to ground the account of real abstraction in the act of exchange considered as physical transfer and the social postulates considered as necessary conditions of possibility—a conception that one would be hard pressed to derive from the works of Marx taken on their own. It is the typically Kantian concern with establishing the validity of the non-empirical concepts involved in mathematical and scientific cognition in relation to experience that best makes sense of the motivation for this decision.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel indicates the importance of this concern for his investigation in the sections on "Reification at the Root of the Intellect\" and "Laws of Nature"; Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 60--2*.*</d-footnote> Without it, there would be no reason to “supplement” Marx in the way Sohn-Rethel does by dividing the process of abstraction involved in exchange into an <em>a priori</em> portion that involves conditions of possibility and <em>a posteriori</em> portion that imparts it with its own (abstract) physicality.</p> <p>In order to avoid the formalism and dualism that Sohn-Rethel is led into by his Kantian problematic, in this essay I will be focusing not on the emergence of some transcendental structure or general mode of thinking (whether this be conceived in terms of “scientific thought,” “abstract intellect,” “philosophy,” or “rationality”), but rather on the emergence of a determinate concept, abstract substance, as it arises in the determinate circumstances in which it was developed, and insofar as it represents the first clear formulation of the opposition between being and an abstract substratum thought to posit it and constitute its truth—without assuming that this recognizability entails a continuity in with later formulations of essence in terms of its meaning or function. This means to bracket off those other questions, not because I don’t think there is anything to them—I suspect that there are actually multiple relatively independent processes taking place on different time scales, but do not discount the possibility of a significant and transformative convergence of some of these processes in Archaic and Classical Greece that corresponds with the purported object of the above theories—but because I don’t think approaching such a question in such broad strokes is productive for understanding the actual historical developments under consideration. It is only by paying attention to the intricate and particular details of historical processes, and situating them within the context of the total social process that they form moments of, and of the determinate mode(s) of production on the basis of which that process takes place, that these questions can be answered without running the risk of falling into the schematic and ahistorical kind of thinking that overtook Sohn-Rethel. Unlike Sohn-Rethel, I do not think that there is a singular key to unlocking the mysteries of the social determination of abstract thought, and so, to sail through the narrow passage between the Scylla of this kind of reductionism and the Charybdis of losing oneself in the immensity of the details, broader questions must be sacrificed (at least temporarily) in order to preserve the seaworthiness of our explanatory vessel.<d-footnote>This also means bracketing for the moment the question of Greek mathematics and its relation to both earlier mathematical traditions and philosophy, although I do think there is something distinctive about greek math and it does have something to do with the same processes that led to the emergence of Greek philosophy, with which it seems to be intertwined (at least biographically in the lives of the early philosophers). In terms of changes in the form of thought, it seems to me that the most fruitful angle from which to tackle this topic would involve investigating the development of the judgment and the syllogism as conceptual-linguistic forms. I hope to build off of the present study by pursuing both of these lines of inquiry in future pieces.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="2-the-pre-history-of-the-concept-of-essence">2. The Pre-History of the Concept of Essence</h2> <h3 id="bardic-truth-and-its-mode-of-production-21">Bardic Truth and its Mode of Production (2.1)</h3> <p>As we saw above, in order to understand the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in Pre-Socratic Monism, we must situate it within the total social process that its development constituted a moment of.<d-footnote>For a more extensive discussion of what this means, see Appendix 1</d-footnote> This means looking back at its conceptual antecedents and the mode of production in which they were situated before moving on to the changes in that mode of production that conditioned the emergence of essence in the thought of the Pre-Socratics, which we will examine in section 2.2. In this section, I will content myself with a brief summary of the kind of society that existed in Greece at the earlier pole of this historical process, in order to then examine the mythico-poetic system of representation that corresponded to it. It was in this social and representational context that one of the primary determinations of essence identified by Marcuse, truth (<em>alētheia</em>), had been situated before changes in the mode of production led to its re-configuration into the form it would take in the concept of essence developed by the Pre-Socratic Monists.</p> <p>In the Homeric poems, we can see both poles of this process of development—despite the archaizing perspective of the bardic author. For now, our focus must be on the earlier pole, which was characterized by a mode of production in which commodity production and exchange were relatively marginal and slavery had not yet taken on the central place in the mode of exploitation that it would in the later period.<d-footnote>See Appendix 2, 260-266 for a more extensive discussion of the role of slavery in the two periods and a critique of Finley's conflation of them in _The World of Odysseus._</d-footnote> In the communities of this period, the class structure of society was instead centered on external appropriation of the surplus of other communities through warfare and raiding and the internal appropriation of surplus in the form of tribute on the basis of the role that warrior-aristocrats played in the necessary communal labors of religion and self-defense.<d-footnote>See Appendix 2, 253-260 for a more in depth look at the different elements of the mode of exploitation in these communities.</d-footnote> The most important point here is that within the community the mode of surplus appropriation was still, to some extent, based on the social role of the warrior aristocracy in the necessary surplus labor on which the survival of the community as a whole—and the independent production of the individual households that together constituted that community—depended. This is true not only of the martial activities that directly ensured the survival of the community, but also of the religious activities that cohered the community <em>as a community</em> and mediated the reproduction of the social relations of production through which the direct production of the means of life was carried out. In this sense, the warrior-aristocracy provided the unity of the community as such, and they did so on the basis of personal authority and a network of ritually institutionalized relationships, which guaranteed the sanctity of that authority through the supersensible power of the gods.<d-footnote>A possible explanation of why the authority that guaranteed the sanctity of the customs and rituals through which social relations were mediated took the form of supersensible or divine power is suggested by Marx in the section of the _Grundrisse_ on pre-capitalist social forms, where he says that in early communal forms of society, both the social and objective presuppositions of direct appropriation though the labor process "are not themselves the _product_ of labor, but appear as its natural or _divine_ presuppositions." Karl Marx, _Grundrisse: Foundations of the Critique of Political Economy (Rough Draft),_ trans. Martin Nicolaus (Penguin, 1993), 472. With this in mind, we can understand the need for divine authority to guarantee personal authority and the institutionalized relationships it was embedded in as a result of the fact that the social conditions of both (such as custom, kinship structures, common language etc) are _presuppositions_ that do not stem from the activity of the individuals that make up the living community themselves.</d-footnote></p> <p>The bard was another figure involved in this system of divine sanction, and it is in the religious structure of Homeric society that connects the bard and the warrior aristocrat—and in its mytho-poetic representation—that we can most clearly see the place of truth in Pre-Archaic Greek social formations, in which it had a different content and set of conceptual relations than it would come to have in PSM. The bard was seen as able to imbue action and speech with divine sanction, though of a particular type: the sanction of the Muses.<d-footnote>Marcel Detienne, _The Masters of Truth in Archaic Greece,_ trans. Janet Lloyd (Zone Books, 1999), 39--42.</d-footnote> The Muses were the divine personification of <em>mousa</em>, sung speech, which was connected with “laudatory speech”.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 40.</d-footnote> They were also portrayed as the daughters of Memory (<em>Mnēmosynē</em>) and, with their power to know “all things that were, things to come and things past,” they “claim[ed] the privilege of ‘speaking the truth.’ ”<d-footnote>Homer, _Iliad_, trans. Richmond Lattimore (University of Michigan Press, 1951), 1.70, quoted in Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 42--3; Hesiod, _Theogony_, trans. Richmond Lattimore (University of Michigan Press, 1951), 28, 32, and 38, quoted in Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 42--5.</d-footnote> Detienne argues that this sung speech allowed the bard to “enter into contact with the other world, and his memory granted him the power to ‘decipher the invisible.’ ”<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 43.</d-footnote> It is this contact with the invisible world, facilitated by divine, oracular memory, that allowed the bard, like the Muses, to speak truth, to confer divine sanction on his words of praise and blame, and the deeds they referred to, most importantly the deeds of the heroic warrior-aristocrat.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 45.</d-footnote> It is through the bard that the <em>kleos</em> (glory) of the warrior was thought to reach not just the ears of the community and future generations, but up to the heavens.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 46.</d-footnote> In this way the bard played a role in solidifying the divine sanction that ensures the social sanctity of the institutions centered around the warrior-aristocracy.</p> <p>Should we understand this social function of the bard, in which the truth of their statements was embedded, as merely an ideological support for the rule of the warrior-aristocrat? This was clearly one aspect of the bard’s function, but even it must be taken in the context of a social situation in which that rule was based on the role of the aristocrat in the necessary social labor that ensured the reproduction of the community. Furthermore, the bards themselves clearly played an independent role in that necessary labor insofar as their praise and blame, as well as the broader narrative context in which it was allocated, did not merely sanction the rule of warrior-aristocracy, but also preserved and transmitted the customs and broader cultural heritage through which social relations, both within a community and between communities in a broader network of alliance and obligation, were mediated. This is the function that secured their truth, that gave it its meaning, that vested it in them as bearers of that function, and that was expressed as an oracular connection with a divine world in which memory provides access equally to past, present, and future as elements of an atemporal ‘plane of truth.’</p> <p>At this point, it is useful to compare this mythico-religious conception of truth with the determination of truth as it would appear once it had become situated within the conceptual relations of PSM. In the latter, truth will have taken on the determination that Marcuse identifies with it of establishing a hierarchical relation between levels of reality in which one level is taken to be in some sense more “real” than another. It will also have assumed the connection to unity, universality, and abstraction that Marcuse posits as characteristic of the concept of essence. In the earlier bardic conception, despite significant continuities (which we will return to shortly) the overall determination of truth is different on both scores. On the first, while it is does appear to distinguish between two different levels of reality, and does do so to some extent—i.e. between the divine, atemporal “plane of truth” and the mortal realm—its real opposition is with oblivion (lēthē), and its function is primarily to distinguish, within the mortal realm, and through the action of divine memory, that which is to be preserved and elevated up to the undying realm of the gods from that which does not merit preservation and so will be forgotten and sink down into oblivion.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 47--52*.*</d-footnote> This is a different sorting process from the one involved in the truth of PSM, one that operates on the basis of moral categories (praiseworthiness, blameworthiness, glory, etc.) rather than the logical or metaphysical categories of the latter conception (unity, universality, abstraction). Even the “unseen world” that the truth of the bards provides access to is not seen so much as underlying the mortal world as being parallel to and in constant interaction with it.</p> <p>Still, the similarities are significant. Most importantly, bardic truth does posit a division between different planes of reality, one sensible and mortal, and the other supersensible and in some way atemporal. This atemporality has a certain ambivalence between the senses of <em>immortality</em> as that which does not die and <em>permanence</em> as that which is invariant or eternal. Both of these senses can be seen as related to the social function of the bard. The first relates to the distinctly personal and subjective aspects of this function. It is the mechanism of oral transmission and its characteristic objects (warrior-aristocrats and their words and deeds) that determine atemporality as immortality, as an elevation of particular elements of the concrete mortal world to a special status in which their temporal nature is not so much removed as infinitely extended by the memory of the bard and the act of preservation and transmission through the process of telling and retelling.<d-footnote>As a bad infinity, this process of telling and retelling cannot realize the immortality that it ascribes to its objects. Instead it must inscribe them within the perpetual ought of its own process of reproduction, the instability of which, along with its dependence on continuous reinscription within the living community, probably contributes to the porosity of the boundary between the "unseen world" and the mortal realm, although this is clearly also a product of the need to posit more active divine intervention to ensure the sanctity of ritually inscribed relations whose purely interpersonal basis would leave them relatively insecure.</d-footnote> The second sense is more properly atemporal, in that it indicates an exteriority to the flow of time, rather than merely being infinitely extended out into that flow. This is the sense that attaches to the plane of truth itself, in which past, present and future are seen as simultaneously accessible, and, in a sense, undifferentiated, or at least cut off from their temporal ordering. It is not the personal-subjective aspects of the bards function that underlie this second sense of atemporality—and so also the basic separation between the planes that lies at the heart of the determination of truth—but the social aspect, or the way in which the bard relates to the reproduction of the social totality, that does so.</p> <p>In preserving and transmitting the customs and broader cultural heritage in which the social relations of production and reproduction were embedded, the bard reproduces the necessary social <em>presuppositions</em> of the social formation. As presuppositions, these stand outside the sensuous activity of the community as conditions of communal production that are not themselves produced by the community. They thus stand outside the normal process of becoming that characterizes the everyday life of the community, and bring together past (as pre-existent), present (as conditions of the current existence of the living community) and future (as conditions of the continuing reproduction of the community) in their separation from that process. This can be seen as the foundation of the second sense of atemporality as being outside the flow of time, as well as of the basic separation between a sensuous and temporal plane of reality and a supersensuous and atemporal one on which the bardic conception of truth as a whole rests.</p> <p>Despite the otherwise general reconfiguration of the concept of truth in the time between the bardic conception and that of PSM, in which the interactive parallelism of the earlier conception became a foundational relationship based on logical-metaphysical rather than moral categories, the basic division on the basis of which the latter conception continued to be structured, between a sensible and temporal realm and a supersensible and atemporal one, can be seen to have already been present in the earlier conception. How should we explain this continuity? Given the basis of the earlier form of the division in the social function of the bard of reproducing the necessary presuppositions of the social formation as a whole, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the persistence of this division was based on the persistence of this social function and to posit that the changes in its organization have their basis in changes in the operation of that function. If we then look at the historical evidence, we do in fact find that this function both persists and undergoes significant change. As we shall see in more detail below, in the later period the impersonal institution of monetary exchange had come to replace the relational institutions of the earlier period as the primary form of social mediation on which the unity of the social formation as such was based, and so also it had itself become the primary social presupposition on which social production rested.<d-footnote>This is not to say that custom or religion stopped playing this function entirely---their continued existence attests to their continued functionality---but simply that they no longer occupied the primary position which they had in the earlier relations of production.</d-footnote> With this transformation, the bard, as a personal, subjective bearer of the function of reproducing this presupposition, was replaced by money itself as an objective bearer of that same function. Simultaneously, truth became detached from its connection to the social function of an individual with whose speech it was coextensive and began to take on the determinations of the money form, with its division between a concrete material embodiment and an abstract value underlying it, and its role as universal equivalent that provides unity to the diverse commodities related to it in terms of their value.</p> <p>As we shall see in the following sections, the emergence of essence in PSM and its relation to the money form is more complicated than this correspondence would suggest. For one, the objectification of the primary social presuppositions of the changing mode of production meant the dissolution of the direct relationship between speech and the social function of reproducing those presuppositions. It is this direct relationship that grounds the truth of bardic speech, and without it, any assertion of the continuing relevance of that social function to the determination of truth runs the risk of being reduced to mere homology. Relatedly, the correspondence on its own is unsatisfactory insofar as it does not explain why the objectification of the social preconditions of the process of production resulted in a transformation of the determination of truth rather than its abandonment as the social system in which it was embedded collapsed. In fact, there is a divergent intellectual tendency among the Greek aristocracy that did abandon the concept of truth after the collapse of the social conditions of its mytho-religious formulation—the intellectual lineage leading from Simonides of Ceos down to the sophists and beyond.<d-footnote>For the relation between Simonedes and the Sophists, see Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 107--19.</d-footnote> At the same time, the early philosophers, in whose thought the concept of essence emerged, did maintain a degree of continuity with the older conception of truth, and it was precisely on the grounds of the correspondence under discussion here that they did so. This continuity of the correspondence is indicative, and can direct us in the right direction, but it cannot be taken as an explanation on its own. The questions now are why the early philosophers maintained this continuity, and in what ways (and to what extent) were the continuities and differences in their conception of truth determined by the objectification discussed here. To answer these questions, we must turn to the historical context in which both this objectification and the emergence of the concept of essence took place.</p> <h3 id="the-crisis-of-aristocracy-22">The Crisis of Aristocracy (2.2)</h3> <p>Filling out the tapestry whose warp has been laid out above means turning to the transformations wrought by commercialization, military reform and the consolidation of a slave mode of production in the development of Greek social formations between the Early Iron Age and the Archaic Period.<d-footnote>The periodization scheme I am using here is based on the one in Alex Knodell, _Societies in Transition in Early Greece: An Archeological History_ (University of California Press, 2021), 7.</d-footnote> The reciprocal dynamic between commercialization and the changing mode of exploitation played out over a number of centuries, and culminated in 1) the crystallization of the money form out of the process of exchange and 2) consolidation of the mode of exploitation around private appropriation by a landowning aristocracy of the surplus produced by unfree labor.<d-footnote>For the concept of unfree labor in Ancient Greece, see G.E.M. De Ste. Croix, _The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World: from the Archaic Age to the Arab Conquests_ (Cornell University Press, 1981), 133--74.</d-footnote> This process of development is explored in further detail in Appendix 2. For now, suffice it to say that around the 7th century BCE, these processes had reached a critical point in which their effects, especially those of monetization, began to ripple out into society broadly and at an increasing pace, which was then further accelerated by the invention of coinage.<d-footnote>On this last point, see Richard Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy_ (Cambridge University Press, 2004).</d-footnote> It is these effects which characterize to a large extent the profound crises and transformations of the Archaic period, including the development of Pre-Socratic monism.</p> <p>Even the most noted change of this period, the development of the <em>polis</em>, can be seen to be a result of this process of commoditization and monetization. In Appendix 2, I describe how the centers of concentrated settlement that would develop into the first <em>poleis</em> were themselves nodes of long distance trade and the expanding commodity relations that accompany it, as well as the role of this commercial expansion in the centering of slavery within the primary process of production. The <em>polis</em>, as an urban area that incorporated its surrounding countryside, on which it was dependent for subsistence, was made possible by these same developments.</p> <p>That the typical <em>polis</em> was centered around its <em>agora</em>, or marketplace, is indicative, but even more decisive is the composition of the <em>poleis,</em> or more specifically, of the <em>astē.</em> Their primary residents were 1) aristocrats enabled to live away from their land holdings by the surplus labor extracted from slaves, serfs, or debt bondsman 2) craftsmen whose livelihoods were primarily dependent on selling commodities to those aristocrats in exchange for the products of that same surplus labor, and 3) the urban poor who begged or sold their labor-power to the aristocrats or to the <em>polis</em> itself for a wage.<d-footnote>See De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 114--33, 208--26, 269--78; Moses Finley, _The Ancient Economy,_ Updated Edition (University of California Press, 1999), 123--49. It is the combination of De Ste. Croix's characterization of these groups and emphasis on the importance of unfree labor in the mode of exploitation with Finley's emphasis on the consumptive nature of ancient cities and the importance of the landed aristocracy in that consumption that best allows us to see this point.</d-footnote> In a <em>polis</em> like Athens, even the funding of public institutions was derived in large part from the dedications, <em>eisphorai</em> and <em>liturgoi</em> of the aristocrats, in other words from the proceeds of selling the products of the surplus labor appropriated on their estates as commodities (and, even in the earliest cases of temple dedications, these products were exchanged for (often mass produced) objects made of metal).<d-footnote>For the _eisphorai_ and _liturgoi_, see Michael Gagarin, _Democratic Law in Classical Athens_ (University of Texas Press, 2020), Chapter 1, Kindle. For the mass production of temple dedications, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 102--9.</d-footnote> In this sense, the <em>polis</em> as a whole was a social form mediated by monetized impersonal relations. The city itself, the <em>astu</em>, which formed the center of the <em>polis</em> and gave it its unity, was determined as a site of commodity production, exchange, and consumption above all else. Its development was to a large extent a result of the increasing interdependence brought on by the increasing division of labor that arose and expanded along with the expansion of commodity production and exchange, but it was equally made possible by the changes in the mode of exploitation that accompanied this commercialization, which centered the private exploitation of unfree labor on the estates of aristocratic landowners as the primary mode of surplus appropriation on which the subsistence of the aristocracy—and the existence of the broader social formation as such—was based.</p> <p>In contrast to the personal authority that gave unity to the earlier social formations discussed above, and the institutions of personal reciprocity that mediated social relations within and between them, the monetized exchange relations that formed the primary basis of social mediation within the polis were impersonal and given objective unity by money itself as the universal embodiment of commodity-producing human labor. As the universal equivalent, money is separated off from the diverse mass of commodities as the material body in which each and all of them represent their value. It homogenizes the diverse particular forms of human activity whose products it is exchanged for. When a commodity producer exchanges their product for money, they exchange it for the embodiment of human labor in the abstract, for a commodity that has the exclusive function of representing the value of all other commodities. In this act of exchange, they posit their concrete, particular, private labor as abstract, universal, social labor. To the extent that a member of society produces commodities that they exchange for money, they posit their labor as social and qualitatively equal with all the other particular forms of labor that express their values in money. They posit their own labor as a fraction of the total social labor, but at the same time as social only insofar as it is exchanged for money, that is to say only indirectly. In this way the money form privatizes at the same time as it socializes, obscuring the social character of the productive activity of the members of society by embodying it as an external object, and one which can be possessed by an individual.</p> <p>This means that social mediation lost its interpersonal basis to the extent that it became monetized. If a man had money, he didn’t need a patronymic and lineage, nor loyalty, nor customary obligation, nor reputation, nor martial prowess to exercise social power or accumulate its trappings; he could pay for whatever product of the labor of others he wanted or needed and they wouldn’t ask who he was or why he wanted it, so long as they received money in return. To command an army no longer required one to inhabit a defined place in a hierarchy of privileges and obligations defined by honor and heredity but merely to have enough money to pay mercenaries to do your bidding, and this is how many Tyrants usurped power in the Archaic period and beyond.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 279--83*.*</d-footnote> As I noted at the end of the last section, it also meant that the formerly customary and interpersonal social presuppositions of the production and reproduction of the community became increasingly objectified in money itself, which gave unity to the now increasingly indirect and increasingly complex sociality of the different labors involved in the production and reproduction of the social formation as such.</p> <p>These developments resulted in a series of acute social crises that spread out across the Greek Mediterranean as the traditional social forms that undergirded the personal authority and class cohesion of the warrior-aristocracy were undermined. These crises began as crises of the warrior-aristocracy in the face of changing social conditions that then turned into general social crises—to a large extent as a result of the aristocratic responses to those very conditions. We already see this state of crisis expressed in the Homeric epics, both of which revolve around crises of aristocratic reciprocity and the institutions that mediated it.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 44.</d-footnote> It is these institutions themselves and the aristocratic ideals associated with them that explicitly frame the crises that animate the poems. The greed of Agamemnon and the Suitors can be seen as results of the new incentives for accumulation that accompany commercialization and that now outweighed the traditional imperatives for the leader to make a fair distribution or the guests to respect the hospitality of their host. Inversely, the refusal of Achilles to accept anything in exchange for his honor shows the unsuitability of the heroic ideal to the developing forms of social mediation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 38.</d-footnote> Finally, although there are other examples that could be given, the need for divine intervention to prevent the spiraling out of retribution and blood feud as a result of Odysseus’ decidedly heroic and honorable killing of the suitors shows the unsustainability of such forms of retribution in an increasingly (commercially) integrated society that had increasingly little place for the interpersonal violence that surrounded the warrior-aristocrat and which in many ways constituted his distinguishing feature.<d-footnote>This divine intervention is also indicative insofar as it is the gods, those supreme guarantors of aristocratic rule and superiority, who the poet ultimately relies on to resolve the seemingly insoluble contradictions arising from the system of honor and retribution in the mortal world.</d-footnote></p> <p>The Homeric response to the crisis laid out in the poems is characteristic of the overall aristocratic response to crisis in its tendency to lionize the outmoded institutions and values that previously upheld and legitimized aristocratic rule while ignoring or degrading the elements of change that undercut its viability. In a sense the aristocracy as a class acted in similar fashion to Achilles or Odysseus, obstinately trying to hold on to their honor, to the system of values and institutions in which their power and their way of life were embedded, in the face of a reality that ensured that this attempt would lead them to ruin. This impulse to double down on the traditional ideals and modes of conduct in the face of changing circumstances is part of what spelled trouble for the hereditary aristocracy in the context of a social world in which the development of commodity relations had created more integrated social formations with new incentives for accumulation of individual wealth, and possibly had also reduced the tolerance of the lower classes, especially the upper strata of these lower classes, for being treated as targets of appropriation rather than partners to an equal exchange.<d-footnote>Cf. Marx, _Capital, vol. I,_ 178*.* Aristotle also gives an example of this dynamic in the _Politics,_ when he describes the way the ruling family of the hereditary aristocracy of Mytilene, the Penthilidae, used to go around beating people over the head with clubs, until they were attacked in turn by a certain Megacles who took offense to this behavior.

Jonathan Barnes (Princeton University Press, 2014), 2082.</d-footnote></p> <p>The fuller extent of this dynamic comes into view when we look at what we know of the early laws of Athens and the circumstances that gave birth to them. The homicide law of Drako is clearly a response to the untenability of inter-elite blood feuds and the general impression we have of the seventh century BCE is that it was riven by crises arising from this kind of violent inter-elite strife within the hereditary aristocracy and between them and newer claimants to wealth and power.<d-footnote>See, e.g., Federica Carugati, "Athens Before the Crisis," in _Creating a Constitution: Law, Democracy and Growth in Ancient Athens_ (Princeton University Press, 2019), 23--4. Solon too can be seen to be concerned not so much with supporting the lower classes as with curbing those aristocratic practices which threatened the stability of the community as such, as argued by Harris in Edward M. Harris, "A Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" in _The Development of the Polis in Archaic Greece_, ed. Lynette G. Mitchell and P.J. Rhodes (Routledge, 1997), 111.</d-footnote> It is also clear from the laws of Solon and his description of the crisis that prompted his intervention that this kind of inter-elite conflict had broadened out into a general breakdown of social order in which the type of raiding we saw as a key part of the surplus appropriation of the old warrior-aristocracy became common <em>within</em> the <em>polis,</em> leading to the enslavement of citizens and accelerating the impoverishment of the small peasants and their growing indebtedness.<d-footnote>Harris, "A New Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" 106.</d-footnote> We should see this internal breakout of violent appropriation of land, people and goods as the one of the final obstinate spasms of the declining warrior-aristocracy in the face of their changing circumstances. Indeed, the Solonian legislation was the first in a series of upheavals and constitutional changes that registered and expanded the power of the <em>demos</em>, the lower classes, and laid the foundations for democracy.</p> <p>At the same time, this violent spasm was not just the death rattle of an old form of aristocracy, it was also the final labor pang in the birth of a new form. One of its most significant functions was to allow the consolidation of land in the hands of the aristocrats through direct violence, debt and the exercise of political power, thereby establishing the basis of their continuing supremacy within the emerging relations of exploitation.</p> <p>Solon’s laws also abolished the <em>hektemoroi</em>, the situation in which a portion of the population had to pay one-sixth part of their product to others. Harris argues that this did not represent the abolition of debt or the ending of a type of serfdom, as has been traditionally argued, but rather the prohibition of tribute payments like those seen in the Homeric epics, but which had become formalized into a system of fixed payments.<d-footnote>Harris, "A New Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" 103--11</d-footnote> If this is correct, then it would represent an even more explicit sweeping away of the last vestiges of the traditional mode of exploitation of the warrior-aristocracy. Whether this represents the abolition of debt, the ending of a serf-like system or the abolition of tribute payments, it—coupled with the concentration of landed property in aristocratic hands, the increased legal protections and expansion of the scope of the courts, and the ban on enslavement of Athenian citizens—would have cleared the way for the consolidation of the mode of production around the commercialized polis—where dispossessed peasants would have had to have gone and become artisans, beggars or hired laborers (outcomes encouraged by other elements of the laws attributed to Solon, such as banning the export of grain and requiring fathers to teach their sons a trade)—on the basis of the aristocratic exploitation of slave labor on large landed estates in the countryside.<d-footnote>On the other Solonian Laws, see Carugati, "Athens Before the Crisis," 24.</d-footnote></p> <p>It is also worth noting in connection with this that Solon made wealth—defined by agricultural output—the primary criteria for political participation, which likely expanded the base of that participation to certain upper-middle strata who had previously been excluded, even if the distinctions between the ‘classes’ were fairly fine and all referred to owners of substantial amounts of property, as Osborne argues.<d-footnote>Robin Osborne, _Greece in the Making: 1200--497 BC,_ 2nd ed. (Routledge, 2009), 208.</d-footnote> With these changes—already developing before the Solonian reforms and continuing to be given further definition after, but for which the Solonian crisis and its purported solution represented a decisive shift—we see how the death throes of the old warrior-aristocracy, and the aristocratic reaction against them, led to their transformation into an aristocracy defined by ownership of the primary means of production (land) and the exploitation of slave labor.</p> <p>Across the Greek Mediterranean, the primary agents in the overthrow of the old aristocratic political order were a series of figures known as tyrants (among whom some count Solon himself, although he was somewhat unusual in being appointed to resolve the civil strife in Athens rather than seizing power by force). The tyrants were not just agents but also expressions of the crisis of aristocracy—and of the class struggle that it was enmeshed with. They often rose to power using the new means made available to them by the process of commercialization and the conflict generated by the exhaustion of traditional modes of aristocratic power. They played aristocratic factions and clans off each other, took up the causes of the burgeoning middle strata of medium sized landowners and larger landowners excluded from the hereditary aristocracy’s monopoly on political power (some of whom probably derived their wealth from commercial activities before using it to buy land), played on the discontent among the lower strata of small and dispossessed peasants, hired mercenaries to back their coups, and bought off important people and segments of the population either directly or through public expenditure. Many of these means were based directly on money as a new impersonal form of social power that could be accumulated by an individual and used to purchase things (status, good will, military forces) traditionally reserved for those who had personal authority issuing from their place in a system of defined social roles and obligations. Others were based on the conditions of class struggle associated with large-scale shifts in social relations produced by both commercialization and the consolidation of a slave mode of production. It was these conditions that were decisive for the tyrants writ large and that defined their overall historical role in breaking the political control of the hereditary warrior-aristocracy and expanding the class base of political participation.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 279--83.</d-footnote></p> <p>Along with commercialization, changes in the mode of exploitation, and the class struggle that accompanied these, the final major factor that drove the crisis of aristocracy in the Archaic was a shift in the organization and conduct of warfare known as the Hoplite Revolution. Though the orthodox position that a revolution in the conduct of warfare—in which the adoption of the hoplite panoply and phalanx tactics led to the increasing importance of a middling stratum of independent farmers in the composition of Greek armies starting in the 7th century BCE, and, as a result, to the increasing political and social power of this middling stratum—remains controversial, and continues to be challenged in many of its details, Hanson persuasively argues that it holds up in its broad strokes.<d-footnote>Victor Davis Kagan, "The Hoplite Narrative," in _Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece,_ ed. Donald Kagan and Gregory F. Viggiano (Princeton University Press, 2013), 256--70.</d-footnote> This “revolution” would have displaced the traditional warrior-aristocracy from its central position in the necessary communal labor of warfare, thereby further undermining the traditional base of their position within the class structure of their social formations and so of the legitimacy of their rule. Combined with the other factors discussed above, this represented a complete break with the former social relations that had upheld the warrior-aristocracy as a class and erosion of the basis for their own self-conception. It created a crisis in which the very definition of aristocracy was called into question at the same time as the aristocrats found themselves increasingly embattled with challenges to their position from below. In a certain sense, the erosion of the religious and military basis of their previous mode of exploitation left them with little justification for their rule and position in society aside from bare exploitation itself, which would’ve provided little ideological support in the face of challenges from the tyrants and demands for increasing rights and privileges from the rising middle strata and the lower classes that often formed the broader social base of their struggles. Add to this the fact that attempts to cling to the old ways were actively creating dysfunction and only increasing the strife, and it is clear that an ideological shift needed to take place, both in terms of legitimation and practical orientation, in order for the aristocracy to re-consolidate itself and its place in the fledgling relations of production that were arising around it.</p> <p>It is in the context of this need that we should understand the development and spread of Pre-Socratic Monism and the concept of essence which emerged within it. But, before turning to PSM itself, it is useful to look at the writings of Theognis of Megara, in which we can see evidence of the shifting aristocratic response to this crisis and the changes it brought to the determination of truth even before development of PSM.</p> <h3 id="theognis-a-transitional-conception-of-truth-23">Theognis: A Transitional Conception of Truth (2.3)</h3> <p>The poems attributed to Theognis are thought to have been written sometime between 650 and 550 BCE, thus firmly within the early period of the acute crisis of aristocracy that I have been discussing, but slightly before (or contemporaneous with) the first thinkers of PSM. In them, the poet bemoans the state of affairs in his polis, where, “this city is a city still, but lo! her people are other men, who of old knew neither judgments nor laws, but wore goatskins to pieces about their sides, and had their pasture like deer without this city; and now they be good men, O son of Polypaus, and they that were high be now of low estate.”<d-footnote>Theognis, "The Elegiac Poems of Theognis," in _Elegy and Iambus,_ vol. 1, Perseus Digital Library, 53--60.</d-footnote> These new men from the countryside, who the poet feels has usurped the place of his aristocratic peers, are distinguished throughout the poems by their attaining their position as a result of wealth (<em>ploutos)</em> rather than by being of good stock. The other oppositions that structure the poems are between truth—both as honesty and reality—and deception (or falsity), and between the good and the bad. These oppositions are structured in such a way that truth is aligned with good stock (heredity) and falsity/deception with wealth, while the good and the bad stand in an ambiguous and reversible position with respect to the others as a result of the falsity and deception generated by wealth. It is anxiety over the difficulty involved in distinguishing the <em>truly</em> good, which is aligned with heredity, but under the corrupting influence of wealth requires supplemental qualities to distinguish it—qualities like intelligence/judgment (<em>gnōmē</em>), power (<em>dynamis</em>, which still has its bodily/martial strength connotations, but has taken on a sense of authority/influence that is probably more operative here<em>)</em>, and moderation or self control—from the mere appearance of goodness created by wealth.<d-footnote>Moderation or self-control are most directly expressed in terms of taking the _messēn hodon_, the middle road or being _mesos_, in the middle.</d-footnote> At the same time, despite the identification of wealth with corruption, this process of discernment is explicitly aligned with the discernment of legitimate currency from counterfeit, which is used as a model for the difference between outward appearance (<em>ideai)</em> and a true, inner content (such as a person’s mind or heart).<d-footnote>Theognis, "The Elegiac Poems of Theognis," 119--28.</d-footnote></p> <p>The first thing to note here is that unlike in the Homeric picture of the crisis that we discussed above, the commercial origins of the more acute crisis faced by Theognis can no longer be omitted or downplayed. At the same time, the effects of commercialization—represented here by wealth (the abstract expression of which is almost certainly a sign of its monetization)—can still be, and constantly are, denigrated and disavowed. This shows a certain continuity in the aristocratic response to commercialization and its effects—despite the shift in emphasis from omission and downplaying to denigration and disavowal, and despite the explicit foregrounding of (the bearers of) monetized wealth as the cause of the crisis.</p> <p>The second is that heredity has become the defining feature of aristocracy rather than honor or martial prowess, despite the supplemental quality power (authority/influence) preserving some residue of the origins of the former in the latter. On the other hand, the other two supplemental qualities represent newer values that were absent in the Homeric portrayal of the warrior-aristocrat (although we might see a precursor to the foregrounding of judgment in the craftiness of Odysseus), ones determined by the crisis and changing material basis of aristocracy itself. It is telling in this respect that one of the primary meanings of judgment within the poems seems to be the ability to correctly discern who and what is truly good in the face of the deceptive appearances generated by wealth, which is to say that judgment, as a definitional attribute of true aristocracy entails to a large extent the very ability to distinguish the aristocratic from the common. In this sense we could say that in Theognis, the aristocratic value system that upheld the legitimacy of the Homeric warrior-aristocrat has been evacuated of much of its concrete meaning and reduced to a bare status distinction the primary determination of which—heredity—is not substantial enough to clearly delineate it in the eyes of even its defenders.</p> <p>The third thing of note is that the conception of truth put forward here represents a sort of intermediate conception between the mytho-religious and philosophical conceptions discussed above in relation to bardic truth. In Theognis, truth had not yet taken on its relationship to the metaphysical categories of unity, universality, and abstraction that it would in the concept of essence. Its sorting process still operated on the basis of moral criteria (albeit new moral criteria) and took people, words, and deeds as its characteristic objects. It was concerned with separating the good (aristocratic) person—or their actions, words or intentions—from the bad, though this had already become a process that functioned on the basis of a split between hierarchically ordered levels of reality, between sensible outward appearances and an imperceptible true content seen to underlies them.<d-footnote>The modeling of this separation on the difference between either the exchange value of a commodity and its use-value, or between the material body of gold and silver and their value---which underlie the ability to counterfeit, or to find that the money you exchanged for was not actually equal to the value of the commodities exchanged for it---is already suggestive of the influence of money on this reconfiguration.</d-footnote> It also still maintained a connection between truth and the social position of its bearer, although the privileged position had shifted from that of the bard to that of the aristocrat himself. On the whole, it is a conception of truth that appears relatively confused and empty of content. The possibility of accessing the truth underlying an appearance seems uncertain, as do the criteria on which the distinction between the true and the deceptive should be based. Even the criteria that are put forward are either themselves unstable and insufficient, like heredity, or relatively empty and circular, like judgment. In this sense, Theognis’ conception of truth gives voice to a problem that it does not have the conceptual resources to address, or even formulate clearly.</p> <p>At the end of Part 1, I argued that the transition from the bardic conception of truth to that of PSM was a result of the objectification of the function of reproducing the primary social presuppositions that underlie the existence of the social formation as a whole. Theognis lived in a social formation in which this objectification was relatively incomplete and it is on that basis that we can understand the incompleteness of his conception of truth. This incomplete objectification had proceed to the point where the individual-subjective aspects of the social function of the bard had been supplanted, but the generalization of monetary mediation had not yet reached the point that it would after the introduction of coinage, and so the position of money as the primary presupposition of the social totality had not been fully solidified.<d-footnote>For a similar, though ultimately divergent, account of this objectification and the role of coinage in it using different terminology, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote></p> <p>It is also in this light that we should see the inaccessibility of truth in Theognis, as well as the relative diminishment of the importance of atemporality in his conception of it. It is because the social function of the bard had broken down and the reproduction of the social presuppositions had not yet found a stable bearer in money that the status of the truth, which had previously been grounded in that function, became uncertain<d-footnote>Clearly it is not just the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social totality that had become uncertain in this period, but the reproduction of the social totality as a whole, as evidenced by the consistent civil strife discussed above.</d-footnote>. Without such stable presuppositions, the sense of atemporality that derived from their role <em>as presuppositions</em> faded away, and although there was still a differentiation between sensible appearance and a supersensible content underlying it present, there was not a strong sense that this was accompanied by the corresponding temporal-atemporal distinction that was attached to it in both the preceding and succeeding conceptions. Even the sense that these are distinct planes of reality has now become confused; it is dirempted between the flattening entailed by it being a person’s heart or mind that serves as the object of the truth-appearance distinction and the heightening of the distinction to the point of separation implied in the anxiety over whether truth can be apprehended at all.</p> <p>Additionally, the opposition between the material body of money and its value had not been brought out into the full clarity that it would achieve after the introduction of coinage. In the distinction between legitimate and counterfeit coinage that undergirds Theognis’ conception of truth, it is the material body of money (its weight, purity, etc.) that distinguishes the true from the false, whereas, with the introduction of coinage, the heightened visibility of the difference between a coins value and the value of the metal it is coined from will reverse this relation—making it the abstract value rather than the material body of money that takes precedence—and thereby facilitate the transition to a conception of truth centered around the determinations of money as the embodiment of value, i.e. unity, universality and abstraction.</p> <p>It is the combination of both of these factors—the incomplete objectification of the primary social presuppositions and the underdevelopment of the opposition between use-value and value—that explains the peculiarities of Theognis conception of truth, especially the incompleteness and problematic character of it that led us to see it as intermediate or transitional. In the poems of Theognis a new conception of truth began to emerge from the husk of the old, just as in his social situation a new mode of production was being born from the crisis of the preceding forms. It is only with the consolidation of this new mode, whose fundamental moments were monetary mediation and the exploitation of slave labor, that the fledgling determination of truth glimpsed in his works was able to develop into the fully-fledged concept of essence that characterized the thought of the Pre-Socratic Monists.</p> <p>As we shall see in Part 3, this did not happen of its own accord—a brute movement of the economic base that resounded through the superstructure and can be interpreted on the basis of homology. It was rather a reciprocal process in which certain conceptions were taken up and developed by certain (class-determined) subjects in response to the economic and social transformations facing them and on the basis of the functionality of those conceptions for those subjects within the class struggle that situated them, and, perhaps, on an inability on the part of those subjects to recognize the true content of the value form.</p> <h2 id="3-pre-socratic-monism">3. Pre-Socratic Monism</h2> <h3 id="money--pre-socratic-monism-31">Money &amp; Pre-Socratic Monism (3.1)</h3> <p>It is now time to turn to the emergence of the concept of essence itself and begin to build an account of its socio-historical determination. In this section, I will build off of Richard Seaford’s account of the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic Monism in <em>Money and the Early Greek Mind</em> in order to establish a baseline conception of this relation. Then, in the next section, I will provide a critique of Seaford’s account, showing how it runs into many of the same pitfalls that we saw earlier in Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel. This critique will provide a basis for developing my own positive conception of this relationship and its broader socio-historical determination in the third section. There, I will argue that it is only by understanding the determination of the concept of abstract substance developed in PSM in terms of its <em>function</em> as part of an aristocratic ideological project in response to the crisis outlined above that we can explain it adequately.</p> <p>The great merit of Seaford’s analysis of the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic thought, and what sets him apart from Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel, is the attention he pays to the concrete conditions in which this relationship developed. In part, this attention to the concrete is probably a product of general intellectual orientation and training as a classicist, but it is also a result of his delimitation of his object of investigation to what he identifies as the emergence of a specifically metaphysical content in the thought of the Pre-Socratics.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175. See especially n. 2.</d-footnote> He describes this metaphysical content as “the counter-intuitive idea of a single substance underlying the plurality of things manifest to the senses,” which allows the Pre-Socratics to develop an “idea of the universe as an <em>intelligible order</em> subject to the <em>uniformity</em> of <em>impersonal</em> power,” and is distinguished as metaphysical by the “concern with reality as opposed to appearance, with what is fundamental as opposed to what is derivative, and with comprehensive as opposed to partial understanding.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 175.</d-footnote> Despite the inclusion in his description of broader cosmological considerations, concern with comprehensiveness, and the genesis of metaphysics as a discourse, all of which fall outside the scope of our own investigation (without therefore being dismissed as legitimate considerations), it is clear that the central determinations of this content are the same ones we have been describing as those of the concept of essence: unity, universality, abstraction and truth.</p> <p>The most important consequence of the concreteness enabled by this delimitation is that Seaford, unlike Marcuse or Sohn-Rethel, is able to offer an explanation of why the emergence of the concept of essence occurred at the specific time and in the specific places that it did. His answer to these questions will ultimately turn out to be incomplete, but they provide us with many of the building blocks out of which my own explanation will be built. For Seaford, the most important of these changes is the introduction of coinage, which both leads to an intensification of the pace and extent of monetization and to a development of the opposition between use-value and value inherent in money.<d-footnote>For the first, see especially, Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 126--9, 134--6, and 198--209; For the second, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 171.</d-footnote> He does a thorough job of demonstrating that these are the primary terms in which the social formations in which PSM emerged and developed can be differentiated from the others in which it did not.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175--89, 198--200, 209--10, and 244, n. 75.</d-footnote> As a result of this, we have a plausible case for identifying the rapid monetization and development of the opposition between use-value and value that followed the introduction of coinage as decisive conditions of the emergence and development of PSM, even if we can’t yet specify how this relationship was established.</p> <p>Seaford also further specifies the significance of these two factors to the development of PSM and its central concept of abstract substance in ways that align with our exposition at the end of Part 2. He argues that rapid monetization results in what he calls the “social transcendence” of “monetary value” which he aligns with the “integrative power” of money, that explains the impersonal cosmology of the Pre-Socratics.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote> Furthermore, it is the fetishism of the commodity, in which social relations become embodied in an external <em>thing</em>, a thing on which “individual autonomy and prosperity and collective cohesion and prosperity seem to depend,” that Seaford sees as the ground of the “unconscious cosmological projection” of the money form into the thought determinations of PSM (on which more below).<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote> All this points to the complete objectification of the function of reproducing the social presuppositions of the social formation as a whole that we highlighted as still missing in our analysis of the Theognis’ transitional form of truth above. It is the generalization of monetary mediation as result of the introduction of coinage that allows this objectification to be completed. Once it is, we find that truth too has achieved a stable form in the concept of abstract substance, in which the hierarchical ordering of levels of reality has become attached to the determinations of unity, universality and abstraction, which are themselves determinations of the money form and the abstract value it embodies. It has also begun to regain the sense of distinction between the planes and association of the true with atemporality that it had in bardic conception, although these would only become fully realized with the completion of the progressive abstraction of PSM in the thought of Parmenides.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 206, 211, 231, 237 and 244--6</d-footnote> This does not take us beyond the homology we have established in the preceding sections, but it does confirm it and expand our understanding of the grounds of its development in PSM.</p> <p>In a similar fashion, Seaford’s account of the development of the opposition between concrete use-value and abstract value in coinage confirms and expands our understanding of its role in the development of PSM. He argues that coinage brings out this opposition, in two ways. The first is by diminishing the importance of the material qualities of the metal (its weight, purity, etc.) in favor of abstract quantity (the determinations of unit and amount) and the second is by establishing a “systematic discrepancy between the conventional value of a coin and the concrete value of its bullion.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 171.</d-footnote> Together, these increase the visibility of the opposition between use-value and value, and in doing so bring forward the mysterious ideality of value, the way it appears to be an abstract, supersensible element of every commodity, and one that is independent of their concrete material properties and origins.<d-footnote>Cf. Marx, _Capital,_ vol. I, 163--4.</d-footnote> It is this same ideality that characterizes the abstract substance of PSM, which, like value, is conceived of as an abstract universal that unifies the diverse multiplicity of concrete sensible particulars that it is separated off from. Similarly, the progressive abstraction that Seaford emphasizes in the development of PSM from Thales to Parmenides follows the contours of the opposition between abstract value and its concrete monetary embodiment, moving from conceptions that resemble money in being themselves concrete objects separated off from all others as the universal equivalent, the object-type in which their qualitative differences are extinguished and equalized, to those that resemble value in being a pure abstraction, divested of material qualities except insofar as it is embodied in the things that represent its form of appearance.</p> <p>In addition to the introduction of coinage, Seaford’s concreteness allows him to specify a number of other important socio-historical conditions of the emergence of the concept of abstract substance, although, without an explicit concept of the mode of production, he is left to present them (for the most part) as an external aggregate of independent conditions, which prevents him from giving an adequate account of the determinate relationships between them. The most important of these are the crisis of the traditional social order centered around the warrior-aristocracy, the class struggle that accompanied the rise of the Tyrants, and the aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency.<d-footnote>It should be noted here that all three of these suggest an implicit recognition of the importance of the mode of production and its class structure for explaining the emergence and development of PSM, registering some of the effects of the transition that we described above without being able to articulate them together as moments of a totality.</d-footnote> In terms of the first two of these, aside from providing material that was used in constructing our account of the crisis described in Section 2.2 (and Appendix 2), the main thing that Seaford provides us with is confirmation that the social formations in which PSM developed were experiencing acute manifestations of that crisis.<d-footnote>Such as the fact that all of the _poleis_ in which PSM emerged and developed were either experiencing, or had recently experienced, the rule of a tyrant and/or heightened class antagonism. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 183.</d-footnote></p> <p>The third, on the other hand, introduces a new consideration, and one that will play an important part in my own conception of the social determination of PSM. Seaford introduces this ideological consideration in his discussion of Parmenides in order to explain the “problem of <em>why</em> value is abstracted from circulation.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 246.</d-footnote> He thinks that this abstraction of value from circulation lies at the basis of the differences between Parmenides’ concept of substance, which resembles monetary value in its total abstraction, and the substance concepts of his predecessors, which combine elements of both value and circulation in their relative concretion.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 246.</d-footnote> The aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency, which finds its <em>locus classicus</em> in Aristotle’s formulation that, “it is the mark of an <em>eleutheros</em> (free man, gentleman) not to live for the benefit of another,” is introduced as an external ideological factor that acts on the homologous relationship between money and the philosophical content of PSM, unconsciously motivating the separation of abstract value from concrete circulation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247; De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World_, 90, 116--7; 2014, _Rhetoric_, in _The Complete Works of Aristotle:The Revised Oxford Translation,_ ed. Jonathan Barnes, 2176 (1367a32), where the translation is "\...not to live at another's beck and call."</d-footnote> In doing so, it makes self-sufficiency, which Seaford thinks is already latent in the determination of value, into one of the central determinations that defines abstract substance.</p> <p>This ideological determination of PSM brings us closer to our own concern with its ideological character, although it doesn’t go far enough in that direction insofar as it posits the ideological as an external influence that shapes the development of the concept of abstract substance—and does so at a relatively late stage in this development. This relative externality of ideological considerations to the determination of the substance concept of PSM raises the question of what, for Seaford, differentiates the ideological character of the concept of self-sufficiency from the supposedly non-ideological character of the money-derived content of the concept of substance. Seaford does not explicitly spell this out, but it is clear from the way he discusses self-sufficiency that it must be the derivation of the former concept from the class structure of the social formations in question—and from the position of the aristocracy within that structure—that marks it as ideological.</p> <p>Following De Ste. Croix, Seaford describes the “ideology of economic self-sufficiency” as an expression of the “crucial opposition between those who by virtue of their command over the labor power of others were <em>free</em> to lead a civilized life (the ‘propertied class’) and those who had to work to maintain themselves.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247.</d-footnote> The class character of this ideology is introduced in this way only to be dropped and never mentioned again as the discussion turns back to the determination of self-sufficiency and its relation to the monetary determinations of substance.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247. It is also, as far as I can tell, the only time in which he makes explicit reference to the mode of production in _Money and the Early Greek Mind_.</d-footnote> This is what leads us to identify class origins as the distinguishing mark of ideological content for Seaford. It thereby also allows him to posit the other content of the concept of abstract substance in PSM as non-ideological insofar as it can be seen to <em>originate</em> from the determinations of the money form rather than from the class structure of the social formations in which that concept emerged and developed. This definition of ideology in terms of origins both obscures the ideological character of PSM as a whole and removes the questions of the mode of production and the reciprocal determination of its elements from consideration. As we shall see below, it is only by understanding PSM as determined from the beginning by its ideological function and class character that we can begin to offer an adequate explanation of its origins and development.</p> <h3 id="critiquing-seafords-formalism-32">Critiquing Seaford’s Formalism (3.2)</h3> <p>As I said at the beginning of the last section, Seaford’s account of the emergence and development of PSM gets us a long way towards our goal of explaining the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence. In this section, I will identify the aspects of Seaford’s analysis of the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic Monism that make it insufficient in relation to this goal. I will argue that this insufficiency is related to the formalistic framework of his project, which bears a number of similarities to the aspects of the works of Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel that I criticized at the beginning of this piece.</p> <p>The formalism of Seaford’s approach can be detected in both its aims and its method. It aims at showing that money, or monetization, is a necessary historical condition of possibility of the “genesis and form” of the “metaphysical preconceptions about the basic constituent of the world and its transformations” shared by the various pre-socratic philosophers, or, in other words, of “the counter-intuitive idea of a single substance underlying the plurality of things manifest to the senses.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greak Mind,_ 12 and 175.</d-footnote> Although this is not identical to the Kantian idealism that we saw in Sohn Rethel’s attempt to establish the necessary conditions of possibility of both “scientific cognition” and exchange itself in terms of the normative “postulates,” it still partakes of some of the same formalism, and even has something of the same form insofar as Seaford tends to frame his arguments about the monetary origin of said “preconceptions” in terms of their non-derivability from observation or deduction.<d-footnote>See, e.g. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 252.</d-footnote> The aim of this project is formalist insofar as it aims at establishing the formal grounds of the possibility of PSM, rather than explaining the <em>actuality</em> of its socio-historical determination.<d-footnote>The focus on giving a historical explanation of the seeming _apriority_ of its preconceptions adds to this formalism</d-footnote> It is the latter that is our aim here, and this involves giving an account of why, and how, the form determinations of money were taken up into thought (in a disguised form) as the content determinations of abstract substance, rather than simply establishing the necessity (or at least plausibility) of the origination of the latter in the former.</p> <p>Seaford’s argumentative method, while perhaps adequate to this aim, is constrained by the same formalism insofar as it centers around establishing that there is a (relatively complete) homology between the determinations of money and those of abstract substance, then eliminating other possible sources of the content of the latter (or assimilating them under the dominant influence of the monetary determinations on either historical or formal grounds (i.e. by showing the relative incompleteness of the homology between these and abstract substance), thereby establishing money as the source of those conceptual determinations.<d-footnote>See, e.g. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175--89, 205--9, 217--30 and 246--9. I am not primarily concerned here with the intrinsic weaknesses of this method, although I will note here that these center around the bad infinity of possible conditions and combinations of conditions that necessarily lie outside its eliminative procedure.</d-footnote> In this methodology, the aim of establishing money or monetization as a historical condition of possibility of the concept of monistic substance and the reliance on homology reciprocally determine each other. One the one had, It is only because the historical conditions of PSM are understood as conditions of possibility, and therefore formal conditions, that their “influence” on the latter is able to be analyzed primarily in terms of the formal relationship established by homology. On the other, it is only because that “influence” is understood in terms of homologous correspondence–which allows them to be understood as independent factors whose external conditioning of thought can be registered and isolated out in terms of the presence or absence of shared content–that Seaford is able to determine those historical conditions as <em>conditions of possibility</em> of the concept of abstract substance.<d-footnote>Even the dismissal of certain other conditions on the basis of historical, rather than formal, criteria would not be enough to identify monetization as the decisive condition that differentiates between the circumstances in which PSM emerged and those in which it didn't without the supplementary evidence supplied by the relatively more complete homology of the content determinations of money with those of PSM compared to those other factors.</d-footnote> This reciprocally determining formalism also explains the externality and independence of the conditions in their relationship to each other and to PSM that we noted in the last section, as well as their determination as origins or sources of the content of PSM.</p> <p>Seaford does attempt to offer an explanatory mechanism that could bridge the gap between socio-historical conditions of possibility and the actual relationship between thought and those conditions, but it is caught up in many of the same problems as his overall approach. His proposal for addressing both the why and the how of the homology between the money form and the substance concept of PSM is the “unconscious cosmological projection of abstract monetary substance.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 12.</d-footnote> He portrays this unconscious cosmological projection of money (or of its universal power and exchangeability) as a particular instance of a more general phenomenon in which cosmic order is unconsciously imagined on the basis of the dominant human social institutions in a given society.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 11 and 224--5. The inadequacy of unconscious cosmological projection as an explanation of the relationship between monetization and PSM can already be seen here in the slippage between monetary substance, which presumably refers to value as an _abstract object_ distinguishable from its _concrete monetary form of appearance_, and the universal power and exchangeability of money, which refer to _social functions_ of money arising from the concrete instantiation of value in the process and relations of exchange. Universal power in particular should not be seen as a property of money itself, but as a description of one of the social functions that it has for its possessors. This confusion about what exactly is being projected produces a certain looseness that facilitates the overall argument but simultaneously reduces its clarity and raises questions about its validity.</d-footnote> The determinate difference between PSM and other instances of this projection would then be the fact that the cosmic order takes on the abstract and impersonal determinations of money rather than, for example, the personal characteristics of the monarchical household or the redistributive form of the sacrificial feast.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 11 and 224--5.</d-footnote> In this conception, PSM, “like all representations of the cosmos…attempts to discover order and uniformity underlying apparent chaos.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote> Seaford thus suggests a transhistorical psychological mechanism that responds to a transhistorical psychological need for order and uniformity, in which objects are projected or “imagined” as a model for cosmological representation because they stand out as embodiments of order in their societies, and so can be “abstracted from the potential chaos of experience.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote></p> <p>The largest problem with this explanation is that the concept of projection itself is vague and Seaford does nothing to clarify the sense in which he is using it. As Laplanche and Pontalis had already pointed out in 1967, projection has been used in a number of different, often ill defined, senses, most of which can be reduced down to a general notion of displacement or externalization of an element (typically a psychological or neurological element).<d-footnote>Jean Laplanche and Jean-Bertrand Pontalis, _The Language of Psychoanalysis_, trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith (Routledge, 2018), 349.</d-footnote> In contrast to this is the psychoanalytic conception, in which this externalization is predicated on a rejection of or refusal to recognize the projected element (as belonging to the subject).<d-footnote>Laplanche, _Language of Psychoanalysis,_ 349.</d-footnote> Seaford gives no indication of using projection in the more specified psychoanalytic sense, despite this leaving no explanation for <em>why</em> this projection happens aside from a similarly vague (and, in my opinion, highly suspect) assertion of a transhistorical relation between cosmological representations and “attempts to discover order and uniformity underlying apparent chaos.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224. Note the similarity to Marcuse's 'quest for unity and universality.'</d-footnote> Indeed, the element supposed to be projected, “human institutions” which are the “elements of the familiar that “especially embody the order and uniformity that is abstracted from the potential chaos of experience,” is similarly indeterminate (and therefore both highly contestable and at the same time imbued with an immediate sense of plausibility).<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote> Not only that, but the unconscious nature of the proposed projection relies on a similarly underdetermined notion of the unconscious that leaves out the psychoanalytic emphasis on repression as a constitutive factor in unconscious operations, which leaves us with little idea as to what causes the unconscious repression and projection of social institutions, as opposed to a conscious transformation of the material in thought. Ultimately, the only answers Seaford provides as to why we should take unconscious cosmological projection to be the mechanism through which money determines the ideas introduced by PSM are non-answers insofar as they do little more than re-assert the existence of the formal correspondence established by his general approach—a correspondence they were meant to explain.</p> <p>Another reason for the inadequacy of Seaford’s account for our purposes is that he doesn’t give enough consideration to the <em>function</em> of PSM, or its central metaphysical concepts, within the broader social situation that they arise in, or within the determinate class relations that condition the individuals who developed it. This further consigns his explanation to its repetitive dependence on the homology between the money form and the concept of abstract substance and prevents him from escaping the charges of developing a reflection theory of socio-economic determination, despite his attempts to avoid the latter by acknowledging and integrating into his conception other sources of determination like political developments, mythological predecessors, ideological influences, and ego formation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 12 and 217--30.</d-footnote> To clarify, it is not that these factors do not play a part in the development of PSM but rather that acknowledging them without integrating them into a broader functional conception fails to recognizes the main problem with reflection theories, which lies in their formalism rather than their limited breadth, and, in doing so, reproduces that problem. It is to elaborating such a functional conception and showing how it allows us to bring together the disparate elements of our exposition up to this point that we shall turn in the next section.</p> <h3 id="the-emergence-of-essence-33">The Emergence of Essence (3.3)</h3> <p>In order to avoid the problems that we attributed above to the formalism of Seaford’s approach, we must return to the crisis of aristocracy, and the series of developing social crises it kicked off and remained entangled with, and understand PSM in terms of how it functioned as a response to those crises and their development. In particular, we should understand it as a response to acute moments of crisis by members of the aristocracy that had specific functions in relation to their class position. The acute crisis brought on by rapid monetization after the introduction of coinage would have brought into sharper focus the disjunction between the ideological and libidinal constitution of the aristocratic subject, whose lingering attachment to certain ideas, values, and forms of activity still corresponded to a significant extent to a position within older relations of production that no longer characterized the reality they found themselves in and had to navigate in order to reproduce themselves both as individuals and as a class.<d-footnote>This is especially true if we take into account Sartre's points about the importance of childhood and the class situation of the previous generations in ideological formation. See Jean-Paul Sartre, _Search for a Method_, trans. Hazel E. Barnes (Knopf, 1963), 57--65.</d-footnote></p> <p>In this light, the conceptual innovations of PSM should be seen as a part of the broader aristocratic response to the acute developments of this crisis brought on by the rapid monetization of the social formations in which they arose. In general, it functioned to refashion the ideological foundations of the rule, self-conception and general worldview of the aristocracy in response to the threats posed to them by crisis—and the role the previous aristocratic ideological forms continued to play in the development and perpetuation of said crisis. Earlier, we saw how neither the nostalgic omission characteristic of Homer’s early response to the crisis brought on by commercialization, nor the anxious denigration of Theognis’ response, was able to adequately orient them to these changing conditions. At the same time, we saw how the parallel development of commercialization and the crisis allowed this need for ideological reconfiguration to come out more clearly in the poems of Theognis—where the emptying out of the previous value system had already prompted the beginnings of a reorientation towards new ones—and how this was accompanied by a reconceptualization of truth that mirrored the (still incomplete) objectification of the social function of reproducing the presuppositions of the social formation as a whole. We should understand the development of Pre-Socratic Monism as a new stage in this development of the aristocratic response to crisis in which the rapid and pervasive monetization brought on by the introduction of coinage (along with the other features of coins mentioned above) allowed the early philosophers to develop an ideological account that was able to more adequately respond to the crises they faced.</p> <p>This functional conception aids our attempt to explain the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence in a number of ways. The first is by allowing us to develop a better account of the reasons for the isomorphism between the determinations of its concept of substance and the form-determinations of money. In order to more effectively respond to the social developments facing them, aristocrats in rapidly monetizing <em>poleis</em>, both individually and as a class, needed to develop a more adequate understanding of their societies. The crisis had created an unusual situation in which the reproduction of the exploiting class as a class required not so much a (more or less direct) reproduction of the ruling ideology, and its forms practice and “know-how”, as a <em>fundamental transformation of the ruling ideology</em> on the basis of which the exploiting class could refashion its misaligned and counter-productive forms of practice and “know-how.”<d-footnote>This conception of the ruling ideology and its relation to practice and "know-how" draws from Louis Althusser, _On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses_, trans. G.M. Goshgarian (Verso, 2014), 235--6.</d-footnote> So, when I say they needed to develop a more adequate understanding, I do not mean this simply in the sense of abstract or instrumental knowledge, but rather in the sense of a conceptual anchoring point, a reality schema, on the basis of which they could ensure the effectiveness of this reorientation.Their societies were increasingly constituted as interdependent totalities given unity by money as the singular concrete embodiment of the abstract value of commodities, for which they were universally exchangeable and in which they expressed their equivalence and interchangeability with each other. In positing the universe in a similar fashion, as an ordered impersonal totality in which multiplicity is given unity by a single universal substance, PSM provided a conceptual schema that corresponded to the new reality adequately enough to serve as a foundation for this necessary ideological realignment.<d-footnote>This does not mean that it was the only schema developed to fulfill such a function, or that it did so perfectly, although the lasting influence of its conceptual innovations attest to its success---at least among certain fractions of the aristocracy.</d-footnote> In this context, we can understand the isomorphism between its determinations and those of the money form as a consequence of the ideological demands made upon the aristocracy by the crisis.<d-footnote>It is important to note that it was not just the internal crisis of aristocracy that necessitated this ideological realignment but also the heightened conditions of class struggle and external social crisis that demanded their reconfiguration as a class.</d-footnote></p> <p>Our functional conception also allows us to return to the question we raised in Section 2.1 about the continuities between the Bardic conception of truth and the determination of truth in PSM, in which key elements of the earlier conception persisted despite the objectification of the social function of the bard, which eliminated the direct connection between speech and the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social totality—a connection on which the truth of that speech had rested. As I noted above, Theognis’ transitional conception of Truth did not just correspond to the (incomplete) objectification of the formerly subjective presuppositions, but also to the attempt to reconfigure aristocratic values and redefine aristocracy on the basis of those values, however limited that attempt may have been. This ideological project provides a functional reason for the retention of the concept of truth among both Theognis and the pre-socratics, despite the collapse of the social relationships in which the traditional conception had been embedded.<d-footnote>For the conception of a project used here, see Sartre, _Search for a Method_, 93--100; and Fredric Jameson, _Marxism and Form: Twentieth Century Dialectical Theories of Literature_ (Princeton University Press, 1974), 214--21.</d-footnote> The goal of that project was to reestablish, to the extent that they could, the position they had previously enjoyed before the crisis, and in particular before the usurpation of the tyrants, as well as the general challenging of their status from below by the broader lower classes connected to this usurpation. In response to these challenges, they looked back to the previous fount of aristocratic legitimacy and attempted to adapt it to the conditions they found themselves in.<d-footnote>This is supported by the explicit incorporation of more anachronistic mythico-religious elements connected to the traditional conception of truth in the presentation of the various pre-socratics, such as the residual mythological elements and aspects of the mystery cults that informed both the form and content of PSM, especially in the works of Heraclitus and Parmenides. See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 217--30 and 231--42; and Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 130--4.</d-footnote> The tension between this restorative tendency and the adaptive one discussed in the preceding paragraph goes a long way towards explaining the reasons why the traditional conception of truth was both partially retained and at the same time maintained its correspondence with the now objectified social presupposition of the social formation.</p> <p>There was a double reciprocality between the subjective project of the aristocratic proponents of PSM and the objective conditions in which that project was formulated. On the first level, the objective conditions determined the needs that the project constituted a response to and the class situation in which those needs and that response were situated, while the subjective project determined the specific way in which those needs would be taken up—i.e. in terms of the inherited traditions of the aristocratic subjects who formulated and developed that project and the promise of restoration that they held out. On the second level, the objective conditions also made it so that the subjective project could not be formulated along the same lines as it had been before. The objectification of the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social formation as a whole, and the need for a reality schema on which to base the project of ideological realignment, meant that the traditional concept of truth had to be reformulated, while, from the subjective side, the contours of that traditional conception seem to have determined that reformulation as a reformulation that retained its connection to the (now objective) social presuppositions.</p> <p>To fully understand this last point, we must examine the subjective reasons for retaining a conception of truth a little more closely. What was the appeal of a conception of truth for the aristocratic proponents of PSM? While we cannot say for certain, the most likely reason for this appeal, and the one that best explains the continued centrality of the social presuppositions to this conception, is that it has something to do with the <em>transcendence</em> enabled by the supersensible and atemporal aspects of truth, which was based on the <em>social</em> transcendence of the presuppositions of the social formation.<d-footnote>As we saw in Section 3.1, Seaford attributes this social transcendence to the "integrative power" of money, and the way in which it becomes a necessary form of mediation on which the individual and community both depend. This is not necessarily wrong, as both of these are aspects of its role as a presupposition of the social formation as a whole, but it does not fully grasp why that role makes it socially transcendent. As I argued in Section 2.1, it was the place of the cultural presuppositions reproduced by the bard outside of the sensuous activity of the community as conditions of communal production that were not themselves produced by the community that constituted their social transcendence. With money, the situation is similar, although it is produced by the community. The reason why it still functions as a presupposition despite being produced as a part of the communal labor is because of the way that the process of commercialization individualizes social production and posits money as the sole representative of the _sociality_ of labor. In this way, money can be seen as socially transcendent insofar as it stands outside the individual processes of production that constitute the total social labor and, though itself produced, is separated off from the rest of social production as the ground of its determination as _social_ production.</d-footnote> This transcendence allowed the aristocratic proponents of PSM to eternalize their position in the relations of exploitation, which was beneficial as a means of both legitimating the aristocracy as a whole, and of strengthening the claims of their ideological project in relation to other aristocratic ideologies that did not invoke the same transcendence (and which likely represented newer, more commercialized class fractions).<d-footnote>On this last point, see Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 107--10.</d-footnote></p> <p>We can see here how the function of legitimating the rule of the aristocracy, which, in Section 2.1, we separated out in discussing the social function of the bard in as the less important side in terms of understanding the determination of truth, actually played a role in the persistence of that determination after the concrete relations in which it was embedded dissolved, and of its connection to the social transcendence of the social presuppositions. Without the direct connection that existed between bardic speech and the reproduction of those presuppositions, it was this function of legitimation and its connection to that transcendence that maintained the overall connection between truth and the now-objectified presuppositions. At the same time both the dissolution of that direct connection and the objectification of those presuppositions meant that truth had to be configured differently to maintain its general ideological functionality.<d-footnote>For example, the truth of a statement could no longer be seen as attached to the social position of the speaker, but instead had to be understood as independent and objective, and so (in principle) universally accessible, but, at the same time, increasingly contestable and relative insofar as its independence and objectivity separated it from its connection to any specific individual.</d-footnote></p> <p>The third way in which our functional conception of PSM helps us is by allowing us to specify the relationship between the monetary content of PSM and the aristocratic ideology of self-sufficiency that we discussed in Section 3.1. This ideology of self-sufficiency, already recognizable in Homer, increasingly revealed itself to be the bedrock on which the distinction between aristocrat and non-aristocrat could be made as the monetary confusions of the crisis were worked out and weaker elements of the traditional concept of aristocracy, like heredity, fell to the wayside as the class was reconstituted along the lines set out by the transforming mode of exploitation and commercialization.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World_, 114--7; Moses Finley, _The World of Odysseus_ (New York Review Books, 2002), 68--70.</d-footnote> In this sense, it both pre-existed the developments of PSM and had a certain centrality to the ideological project of the aristocracy as a whole that exceeded the bounds of the specific project that animated PSM. So, to a certain extent, Seaford was right to pose it as external to PSM, but, by understanding it as a supplementary influence that modified and introduced extraneous content to the money-derived content of PSM, he did not understand the way in which the two were co-constitutive in the formulation of PSM and reciprocally determined one another.</p> <p>Both the reconfiguration of truth according to the determinations of the money form and the definition of aristocracy in terms of self sufficiency should be seen as part of the same project of ideological realignment that represented the subjective moment of the determination of PSM. The ideology of self-sufficiency centered around an abstract negation of dependence that allowed the aristocrat to be distinguished from both the commoner and the slave (and from women, who, even if part of an aristocratic household, were considered dependent on the male householder), and made the definition of aristocracy the same as that of freedom, which as a moral ideal provided both a justification for aristocratic rule and a normative standard on which individual conduct could be guided and evaluated, and thereby brought into line with the continuing reproduction of the mode of exploitation.<d-footnote>This alignment of aristocracy and freedom also played a significant role in bringing the conduct of the democratic _polis_ as a whole into line with the reproduction of the relations of exploitation in so far as political freedom took on the same determinations and thereby shaped the norms and expectations of inter-_polis_ relations and conduct for the citizen body in general.</d-footnote> The importance of this emphasis on self-sufficiency can be seen not just in the later developments of a figure like Parmenides, as Seaford emphasizes, but already in one of the earliest formulations of the doctrine of PSM, that of Anaximander, whose <em>apeiron</em>, aside from taking on the determinations of money (especially in its function as means of circulation), is said to have no beginning, and to surround and steer all things.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 192. Seaford does suggest the possibility of earlier influences of the ideology of self-sufficiency, but only traces it back to Xenophanes, merely raises the possibility without following through on it, and does not see how much of a constitutive role it plays in the overall substance conception of PSM. See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 212 and 248.</d-footnote> This connection of abstract substance with stasis and independence clearly has something to do with the transcendence of truth that we discussed above, but its specific form, especially the way in which the <em>apeiron</em> “steers all things” from its position of static independence, bears a significant resemblance to the ideology of self-sufficiency and the aristocratic class position on which it was based.</p> <p>If we take a closer look at that class position in relation to the monetized economy of the <em>polis</em>, and the way in which aristocratic ideology represents a one-sided abstraction that covers over the contradictions inherent in that relation, this resemblance becomes even more telling. As the primary owners of the land and slaves through which the surplus product, on which the whole monetary economy of the polis was based, was appropriated, the aristocracy did indeed have a certain foundational independence in relation to that economy. At the same time, this appearance of independence, which expressed itself in the one-sided abstraction of the ideology of self-sufficiency, was matched by a reciprocal dependence on the slaves whose surplus labor supported their consumption, on the commodified division of labor that was inseparable from said surplus appropriation, and on the goods (and services) they received in exchange for the products of the surplus labor they appropriated, without which they could not have lived as they did.<d-footnote>This one sided appearance of independence was strengthened by the fact that, as owners of agricultural land and slaves to work it, most aristocrats could hypothetically have supported themselves and their households without engaging in exchange, although probably only temporarily and, again, not in the concrete ways in which they actually lived. Furthermore, the goods that supported both the immediate consumption of the aristocracy and the exchange they engaged in had become their property neither as a result of their own labor nor through exchange, so that when they were exchanged (or consumed), they appeared to a certain extent as not just a foundation, but an unproduced foundation, separated both spatially and socially from the process of becoming that gave rise to it. From the perspective we developed above in relation to the social presuppositions of the social formation, it could be said that the ideology of self-sufficiency had its roots in aristocratic control of the other major presuppositions of the social formation, land and slaves, from which it obtained its own transcendence..</d-footnote> From the perspective of this one-sided self-sufficiency, the aristocracy could appear as a static, unproduced foundation of the social formation as a whole, one which steered the whole world of exchange-mediated activity and covered over the aristocracy’s own dependence on both that world of exchange and the slaves whose labor provided the foundation of their existence and social position. It was this one-sided abstraction of the aristocratic position in terms of independence that was transferred to the abstract substance of PSM and increasingly made self-sufficiency into one of its core determinations.</p> <p>This combination of determinations derived from the money form and the ideology of self-sufficiency (or the contradictory objective situation that it covered over) were complementary and helped to stabilize each other. The determination of truth as essence allowed the proponents of PSM to compensate for the one-sidedness of aristocratic self-sufficiency by aligning independence with true reality and consigning the side of aristocratic dependence to the inessential (and, following the absolute distinction posited by Parmenides, <em>untrue</em>) world of becoming. It also supplemented the ideological function of distinguishing between aristocrats and non-aristocrats on the basis of self-sufficiency with a positive account of their right to rule on the basis of intellectual superiority or access to truth. The determination of self sufficiency, on the other hand, allowed them to cohere and stabilize the concept of abstract substance itself in its reflection of the contradiction between the abstract value and concrete embodiment of money.<d-footnote>This is evidenced by the progressive abstraction of the substance concepts of the pre-socratics (which will be discussed more below), which was accompanied by an increasing prominence of the determination of self-sufficiency. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 244.</d-footnote> It also counteracted (to some extent) the deprivileging of truth that had resulted from the objectification of the social function of the bard by re-establishing a connection between truth and the position of the aristocrat.<d-footnote>This was also aided by the class position of the aristocracy itself, which both ensured that they were the main people who had the free time necessary for metaphysical inquiry and, by separating them from the immediate process of production, promoted their development of an abstract consciousness suited to those pursuits.</d-footnote> Together, these factors allowed the aristocratic proponents of PSM to depict themselves as the expositers of an esoteric (even if <em>in principle</em> universal) doctrine that granted access to true reality in opposition to the mere appearance of everyday life, but only for the few whose social position identified them with that truth and enabled them to reach the heights of abstract intellect needed to understand that doctrine.</p> <p>Our functional conception of PSM has already allowed us to develop a much more concrete conception of the emergence of the concept of essence in PSM, but there is one crucial question left to be answered in order to fill out this picture. This is the question of why the determinations of money took the form of cosmological or metaphysical determinations about the universe, or why they were displaced from their social context into the cosmological/metaphysical register. The first likely reason for this is that despite the innovativeness of their new conception, the early philosophers still did not produce it from thin air. The thinkers in the tradition of PSM needed to draw on the ideological resources present to them in order to refashion them, and these were largely cosmological and mytho-poetic.<d-footnote>See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 217--30.</d-footnote> As the tradition developed, we can see a progressive detachment from these origins, what some have referred to as a secularization, but never a full break.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 89--106 and 130.</d-footnote> The second reason is that despite needing to develop a conception that allowed them to orient themselves within the newly and increasingly monetized social world they lived in, explaining that world, or the mechanisms of its monetary mediation, was not the primary (implicit or explicit) aim of their accounts. These accounts responded to the conflict and confusion caused by the misalignment between aristocratic ideology and its social conditions, and its primary function should be seen in terms of refashioning that ideology rather than directly explaining those conditions. In fact, the latter aim probably wouldn’t have been a legible project given the ideological foundations that served as their starting point—although it would become one for a figure like Aristotle, but only after the ideological and philosophical changes that PSM inaugurated had developed and entrenched themselves. The third, and most significant, reason brings us back to the critique of Seaford’s unconscious cosmological projection that I made above. I mentioned there that Seaford’s use of the psychological concepts of projection and the unconscious ignored the psychoanalytic specification of these mechanisms in terms of a negative reaction to some content that is unable to be recognized. From this perspective, we can see the displacement of the determinations of money from their social context into the realm of pure thought as a response to some aspect(s) of the social content of the former that they were unable (or unwilling) to recognize, or, to put it in more Jamesonian language, we can see it as an imaginary solution to the real contradiction between money or monetization and their own class position and ideological project.<d-footnote>Jameson, _The Political Unconscious_, 79.</d-footnote></p> <p>The primary contradiction that motivated this displacement was between the equality of abstract human labor, which is posited by the money form, and the relations of exploitation that determined the class position of the aristocracy, which posited an inequality between the labor of slaves and that of free men. Marx himself notes this as an explanation for Aristotle’s inability to develop a concept of value in the first chapter of <em>Capital.</em> He says that “Aristotle himself was unable to extract this fact, that, in the form of commodity values, all labor is expressed as equal human labor and therefore as labor of equal quality, by inspection from the form of value, because Greek society was founded on the labor of slaves, hence had as its natural basis the inequality of men and of their labor-powers.”<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 151--2. Although it is clear that Aristotle was able to turn the concept of essence back on the original context from which its primary determinations originated, it is also clear that this is a secondary application of the primarily metaphysical concept, and therefore still dependent on the distancing effected by the original displacement, and also that he was still unable to directly apply it to the analysis of value or money itself, whose essence he cannot identify, leading him to declare it inessential and untrue.</d-footnote> If we take the class-situated demand for ideological realignment made by the crisis and the objectification of the social function of the bard as the positive grounds of the functionally-determined taking up of the money form by PSM, then we can take this contradiction between the equality posited by money and the inequality posited by slavery (which has its roots in the same conditions that produced the crisis and its demands) as the negative ground that determined that taking up as a displacement into the cosmological/metaphysical register. We can also see how the ideological project itself further determined the inability to take up this contradiction, which would have stood in opposition to its aim of legitimizing the position of the aristocracy in the relations of exploitation.</p> <p>There is another way in which this equality posited by the money-form may have served as a negative ground of the development of PSM. In order to posit the equality of different concrete labors, money must simultaneously posit them as homogenous fractions of the total social labor. In exchanging their products for money, the owners of those products posit the labor that went into them as as equal not to a specific other kind of labor, but rather to all other kinds of labor that have their equivalent in money, and this is what allows the value of the different products of those labors to appear “as values of quantitatively comparable magnitude.”<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 159.</d-footnote> In doing so, those owners posit their labor in relation to the sum total of the labor in their society, but in an externalized form, as a relation between objects, rather than as a relation between people.<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 164.</d-footnote> At the same time, the process of commercialization that gives rise to money increases the division of labor and in doing so it also increases the degree of interdependence between the producers, integrating previously independent branches of production, and communities, into the unified division of labor of a broader social formation.<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 471-2.</d-footnote> This means that money, along with the commercialization process that it represents the formal culmination of, makes a number of independent communities into an interdependent social totality in a new and more comprehensive way, turns the implicit and subjective unity of those communities (in which which the primary processes of production had, for the most part, been conducted on the basis of the independent household with the function of reproducing that household) into an explicit and objective one, and, at the same time, obscures the social character and interdependence of the various labor processes which it brings into relation and thereby constitutes as fractions of the total social labor, and does so exactly insofar as it enacts that objectification.<d-footnote>Contra Marx, I think that the way in which the commodity and money forms constitute labor as a fraction of a social whole should also be understood as the basis of the qualitative equality of the different labors objectified in the process of exchange. Marx's proposal, that it is their physiological equality insofar as they are expenditures of human muscles, nerves, etc. that forms the basis of their commensurability as quantities of abstract labor, relies on something external to the commodity form to explain the equalization posited by it. While this remains a possibility, it seems more likely to me that the equalization posited by the commodity form has its basis in an aspect of that form itself rather than in an external abstraction, the concrete derivation of which from the act of exchange seems unclear. Exchange itself, and especially monetary exchange, posits the different labors as social at the same time as it posits them as equal, so it seems reasonable to look for the basis of their equality in the sociality posited along with it. In fact, as we saw above, the quantitative comparability of commodities (in which their equality is expressed) is itself based on their exchangeability not with each other directly, but with the embodiment of abstract social labor. This allows us to identify the equality between the labor embodied in exchanged commodities and the quantitative determination of their value as labor _time_ as both having their origin in the way in which exchange posits the different labors as a fraction of the total social labor, with the former deriving from the socialization it effects and the latter from the externalization. It also suggests a possible basis in the commodity form itself for the persistent reappearance of assertions of the inequality of human beings under capitalism, in the form of theoretical and practical racism, despite the tendency to acknowledge the realization of formal equality on the basis of the wage relation. On this account of the origins of equalization, that persistent tendency to racialization could be understood as having its basis in the commodity form insofar as 1) the necessarily nation-state-based organization of capitalist social formations whose economic self-identity is expressed in the differential exchange rates between different national currencies keeps the world broken up into a multiplicity of separate social totalities, which provides a material basis for denying the extension of the principle of formal equality beyond the bounds of the national community (and the derivative ideological expansion of this denial to include members of the racist's nation who can be imaginatively identified as foreign), and 2) the continuing inability to recognize the social content of the commodity form due to the externalized form of social totality posited by the commodity, and the fetishism resulting from it, also undermines the recognition of equality by obscuring its origins and contributing to its ideological slipperiness insofar as it provides a basis for its continuing determination as abstract, merely formal equality. On the national organization of capitalist social formations and the exchange rates between national currencies, see John Milios and Dimitris P. Sotiropoulos, _Rethinking Imperialism: A Study of Capitalist Rule_ (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), 105--8 and 154--9.</d-footnote> As we saw above, the ideology of self-sufficiency was based in the one-sided abstraction away from the interdependent side of this contradiction, and so recognizing this sociality would have further prevented PSM from fulfilling its function insofar as it undermined the functionality of that ideology.</p> <p>This explanation of the displacement also allows us to understand the process of progressive abstraction that we discussed above, in which the attempt to identify the nature of the underlying substance moved from candidates that resembled the concrete use-value of money to candidates that resembled its abstract value.<d-footnote>See Section 3.1.</d-footnote> Now, we can see how the contours of that development, as well as the confusion that prompted it, were results of this negative ground of the displacement of the money form. It was the way in which this displacement and its grounds (along with the inherent fetishism of the money form) obscured the <em>actual substance</em> of value—abstract labor—that determined the form of PSM as a identificatory search and determined the poles within which the development took place. It was because this actual substance was inaccessible that the concept of substance arose in the form of a question as to the identity of that substance, and that the contours of the development took place between the contradictory poles of that substance’s form of appearance, the relation between which cannot be reconciled without a notion of that substance itself.</p> <p>This absence created an instability in the conceptual content of the early formulations of PSM in which it oscillated between the poles of the contradiction, and it was the determination of self sufficiency that helped stabilize this oscillation by driving the process of progressive abstraction noted by Seaford. As PSM developed, there was a simultaneous increase in the prominence of self sufficiency in the substance concepts of its proponents and in the abstraction of that concept as it moved from a greater resemblance to concrete money toward one to abstract value, until, with Parmenides concept of abstract Being, the determinations of truth became completely identified with determinations of self-subsistent abstract value.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 244.</d-footnote> This is not necessarily to say that Parmenides’ conception more adequately reflects the substance of value, which, though abstract, is the result of a process of mediation that it cannot be separated from (which probably makes it more akin to Heraclitus’ conception and its “reversible exchange”), but rather that in it the one-sided abstraction of value and the one-sided abstraction of self-sufficiency developed into a relatively stable form in which each covered over the defects of the other—thus bringing to a close the first first phase of the development of the concept of essence in Ancient Greece in which the question of substance, of identifying the <em>arche</em>, was primary.<d-footnote>For a discussion of "reversible exchange" in Heraclitus, see Chris Kassam, "Heraclitus, Seaford and Reversible Exchange," _The Journal of Speculative Philosophy_ 31, no. 4 (2017): 609--33, &lt;https://doi.org/10.5325/jspecphil.31.4.0609&gt;. I think that Kassam overemphasizes the extent to which the reversibility of exchange in Heraclitus negates the increased level of abstraction that Seaford identifies there. It seems clear to me that Heraclitus posits substance as the inseparable unity of both the abstract self-subsistence of the one and the concrete becoming of the many, while at the same time privileging the one as the underlying moment and ground of the truth of the movement. My favorite example of this is D50 (B54), which Laks and Most translate as "Invisible fitting-together (_harmoniê_), stronger than a visible one." Besides already asserting the precedence of invisible harmony, and so the abstract moment, in terms of its content, this fragment also enacts it formally. The greek text is structured as two pairs of oppositions, an inner opposition between _aphanēs_ (invisible) and _phanerēs_ (visible), which itself has a visible harmony in terms of its morphology, and an outer opposition between _harmoniê_ (fitting-together/harmony) and _kreíttōn_ (stronger), the latter of which originally meant superiority granted to the warrior-aristocrat by the gods and was connected to the idea of domination and came to have a distinct physical/martial sense compared to the other comparative forms that were used to mean 'better.' This seems to be an unreconciled contradiction both visibly and in terms of meaning, but, in the context of the sentence, there is an invisible harmony insofar as the outer terms both determine the relationship between the terms of the inner opposition, with the first providing a substrate of sorts for the meaning of visible and invisible (as both referring to harmonies) and the second providing the structure of their relation. Thus, the outer terms not only create an invisible harmony between the inner terms but also reconcile their own opposition through that act of providing invisible harmony to the inner opposition. It is this invisible harmony that establishes the harmony of the fragment as a whole, that reconciles the opposition between form and content and into which it had divided itself.

This crisis, and the misalignment it caused between the ideological constitution of the aristocracy and objective conditions they found themselves in, created a demand for fundamental ideological realignment that the Pre-Socratic Monists attempted to meet. To do so, they took up and adapted the traditional conception of truth as a means of both reasserting the legitimacy which it had conferred upon their predecessors and providing a reality schema on the basis of which the required reorientation could be grounded. This meant reconfiguring that conception on the basis of the determinations of money, which had taken the place of the customary and cultural traditions reproduced by the bard as the social presupposition of the social totality. At the same time, the contradiction between the substance of value and the position of the aristocracy required the determinations of money to be taken up in a disguised form in order to retain their functional value, displacing them into the cosmological/metaphysical register. But, this reconfiguration of truth on the basis of the displaced form determinations of money could not fulfill the ideological function demanded of it by the crisis on its own. It both required supplementation from, and helped cover over the one-sidedness of, the pre-existing and developing aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency, which provided a basic definition of the aristocrat on the basis of their place in the relations of exploitation, helped stabilize the conceptual confusion caused by the displacement of money, and determined the development of the concept of substance towards increasing abstraction and correspondence with abstract value rather than its concrete embodiment in money.</p> <h2 id="4-conclusion">4. Conclusion</h2> <h3 id="methodological-conclusions-41">Methodological Conclusions (4.1)</h3> <p>At the beginning of this piece, I said that in it I would focus on laying the groundwork for a larger project with two aims: providing a historical materialist account of the origins and development of the concept of essence and developing a Marxist theory of essence that facilitates the project of revolutionary praxis in the present. It is now time to evaluate our progress on these fronts, although, due to the preliminary nature of our investigation, what we will be able to say about the latter will necessarily be more abstract and provisional than what we can say about the former.</p> <p>The contribution made by this piece with respect to the first aim can be broken up into two categories. The first is the confirmation and development of certain theoretical and methodological principles and the second is the provision of a baseline understanding of the emergence of the concept of essence itself in the Greek context. In terms of methodology, the main principles whose fruitfulness I believe has been shown in the course of our investigation, and which I would like to highlight here are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Any explanation of the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence must be grounded in a reconstruction of the concrete historical material corresponding to particular social formations rather than transhistorical determinations or teleological schemas that determine that material retrospectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Such a reconstruction must itself have its basis in the mode of production and its transformations considered as a total social process in which relatively independent spheres and elements reciprocally condition one another in an asymmetrical fashion that gives priority to the broadly economic base.<d-footnote>See Appendix 1 for a more in depth examination of this principle.</d-footnote></p> </li> <li> <p>Attention must be paid to uneven character of such a process, and especially to the lag between the ideological and subjective elements and the economic base, such as we saw in the case of the misalignment between the ideological constitution of the aristocratic subject and the demands imposed upon them by their changing position in the class structure of their social formations.</p> </li> <li> <p>The identification of a homology between conceptual or ideological elements and economic or more broadly social ones can serve as a starting point for investigation and indicator of a connection between those elements and their conditions of possibility, but this identification must be surpassed to offer a proper explanation.</p> </li> <li> <p>A key element of any such explanation is a functional account of the taking up of certain of the objective contents of such a homology into thought.</p> </li> <li> <p>Such a functional account should involve the two moments of class-situated <em>response</em> to the objective situation and subjective project oriented towards intervening in class struggle–and so acting on the objective conditions that solicited the response.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Principles 4–6 in particular represent the methodological <em>results</em> of the investigation undertaken here, and though they remain open to revision or qualification on the basis of further study, I believe that they provide a strong foundation upon which to conduct such study. One way of viewing such a contribution is as an extension of the Hegelian determination of the concept as purposive activity that takes up and transforms its external conditions, and its Marxist reformulation in terms of labor, to the question of the socio-historical determination of philosophy.<d-footnote>For the Hegelian conception of the concept, see Karen Ng, "From Actuality to the Concept in Hegel's Logic" in _The Oxford Handbook of Hegel_, ed. Dean Moyar (Oxford University Press, 2017). For the Marxist conception, see Marx, _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1884_, 75. See also Appendix 1.</d-footnote> From this perspective, we could generalize them into the principle that <em>the determination of thought by its objective conditions always involves activity on the part of individuals according to their subjective purposes in relation to those conditions.</em></p> <h3 id="historical-conclusions-42">Historical Conclusions (4.2)</h3> <p>On the side of the historical content of the emergence and development of the concept of essence, the conclusions outlined at the end of Section 3.3 provide us with a starting point for constructing a broader narrative of that development up to the present. At the same time, we cannot assume a continuity in either the content or function of the concept of essence after this first phase, and so that construction would require a renewed effort of historical reconstruction of the development of both the concept itself and the conditions in which it developed. It is very possible that its persistence and development, if these can be established, resulted from its taking on different functions for different individuals and class fractions in different periods and circumstances. There is also a need for examining other regions like India and China in which a concept of essence seemed to emerge independently around the same time and incorporating those developments into our overall narrative.<d-footnote>Seaford's _The Origins of Philosophy in Ancient Greece and Ancient China_ could provide a good starting point for this work.</d-footnote> Additionally, it seems likely that in attempting to track the further development of the concept of essence after its emergence, further attention would need to be paid to the relative autonomy of philosophical development as it matures and becomes institutionalized. Still, the above account of the relationship between money and the concept of essence suggests a few candidates for explaining the apparent persistence of that concept under different modes of production and concrete circumstances that seem like fruitful areas for further investigation.</p> <p>The first is the connection between the reconfiguration of truth and the emergence of essence. Since it was the monetized objectification of the social presuppositions that determined the contours of the reconfiguration of truth at the heart of the emergence of the concept of essence, this also seems like a good place to look in terms of generating research questions on the basis of which to investigate the persistence of that concept. Is there a persistent connection between the determinations of essence and the role of money as a preposition of social production? Or between essence (or truth) and the general presuppositions regardless of whether or not these are monetary? Or, is this just a condition of their emergence that ceases to play a role in their persistence as time goes on? What happens when capital takes up both the monetary and non-monetary presuppositions into its own process of realization? Similarly, it seems like the negative conditioning of that emergence due to the inability to recognize the substance of value raises a similar set of questions. In particular, the question of whether the persistence of the displacement at the core of the emergence of the concept of essence has its basis in a continuing inability to recognize the equality and interdependence of human labor seems fruitful, and I have already given some provisional indications of how this continuity might manifest itself under capitalist relations of production in note 126. These are just two possible avenues of inquiry suggested by the project undertaken above, but I think they already provide a more promising basis for developing a concrete account of the history of the concept of essence than those currently available.</p> <h3 id="practical-conclusions-43">Practical Conclusions (4.3)</h3> <p>There is a significant historical distance between the object of my investigation here and revolutionary practice in the present day that makes it harder to evaluate its practical significance, so all of the following will have an even more provisional and suggestive character than even the historical conclusions discussed above. Still, I think elements of the research conducted here can help direct our attention in some pertinent directions in terms of developing a marxist concept of essence adequate to the task of facilitating contemporary revolutionary praxis. Before getting into this, I think it is important to point out that my research has led me to rethink Marcuse’s assumption that truth is a subordinate determination of the concept of essence, and to recognize that it was rather essence that appeared to be a form of the concept of truth, a reconfiguration of it on the basis of changing material conditions and ideological imperatives. It will take further research to determine how this relationship continued to be reconfigured over time, so, for now I will speak of the concept of essence with the understanding that it may in fact be the concept of truth in general that I’m attempting to refer to.</p> <p>The first practical consideration I want to discuss has to do with the points made in section 3.3 about the function of essence as both a reality schema used to ground practic-ideological reorientation and as a means of legitimation of the place of the ruling class in the mode of exploitation. On the one hand, I think that the connection between essence and legitimation calls into question its usefulness for a revolutionary project, in which case it might only be the critique of the concept of essence that is useful to us—insofar as it provides us with a means of dispelling the connection between reality indexing and legitimation propagated by that concept. On the other hand, any revolutionary project itself needs a means of effecting practico-ideological reorientation on the basis of current realities, and this might be one of the ways in which a Marxist concept of essence would be valuable, although it would require disentangling these two functions in such a way that its reality schema could be based not on the reproduction of the current relations of production but instead on their overthrow. How to do this, and whether we need to, remain open questions, but I think the research undertaken here has provided a useful basis for beginning to think these questions through.</p> <p>The second practical consideration relates to the negative grounds discussed near the end of section 3.3 and to Marcuse’s assertion of a relation between essence and freedom. I hope that my overall argument has served to dispel the notion that the concept of essence has any positive connection to any substantive idea of freedom that is not premised on exploitation. At the same time, I do think that the role of the negative grounds of an inability to recognize the equality and interdependence posited by the money form could indicate a negative and indirect relationship between the concept of essence and freedom, although this would require more historical work to verify. If the inability to recognize this content and/or opposition to the implications of its realization continued to provide a foundation for the maintenance of the projected determinations of money as metaphysical determinations in the concept of essence, then we should see this content as the continually returning repressed content that haunts thought throughout the history of philosophy, and the concept of essence as preserving the possibility of the realization of equality and interdependence in a negative manner, as that which cannot be realized in order for it to continue to function conceptually. We could also see this as part of the reason why the concept of essence is able to function as a reality schema for monetized social totality, which itself relies on the non-realization of substantive equality and direct interdependence in order to continue to exist as self-externalized social totality. Ultimately, freedom, in its adequate form as collective self-determination, is derivative of these latter determinations insofar as it is premised on the absence of exploitation and the directly collective self-determination of social production and reproduction, without which the possibility of purposive control of the production apparatus and the free mediation of the relationship between human beings and nature according to consciously determined purposes are impossible. Whether we determine that it is solely the critique of the concept of essence or also its reformulation that facilitates revolutionary practice today, we should take this primacy of equality and interdependence into account and orient ourselves more towards them than towards the freedom that would follow from them, or, in other words, we should orient ourselves towards freedom only insofar as it is seen as a product of the instantiation of substantive equality and collective mediation of our interdependent social production.</p> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Althusser, Louis. <em>On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses</em>.
