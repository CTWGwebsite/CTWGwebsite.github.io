More specifically, they were mostly (probably) written by Max Horkheimer, albeit with considerable input from Theodor W. Adorno and occasional feedback from others.</p> <p>The translated fragments have previously been published in the twelfth volume of Horkheimer’s <em>Gesammelte Schriften</em>; we have used the texts there as the basis for our translations. With the exception of “On the Ideology of Politics Today,” the fragments translated here were sourced from an internal ‘publication,’ a typed booklet of twenty “Concepts” (aphorisms) attached to the <em>Festschrift</em> edition of the <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em>—the first version of what would become the <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>—printed as a limited-run mimeograph for Friedrich Pollock’s 50th birthday in May 1944.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p> <p>The translations of the two internal memos are based directly on scans of the typescripts from Horkheimer’s Nachlass.</p> <p>Finally, this collection includes a critical edition of Max Horkheimer’s 1943 essay “On the Sociology of Class Relations” transcribed and edited by James Crane.

We have found it helpful to divide our subsequent analysis of the racket theory project into three major sections, which are not exclusive in terms of content. Our narrative starts with the earliest use of the term in Max Horkheimer’s essay “The End of Reason” (1942). After this, we turn to analyzing the stream of texts which were explicitly composed for or about publication(s), mostly written between spring 1942 and fall 1943. Then we treat the topic of reflexivity and the specific character of the racket theory project that flows from its particular form of reflexivity. Finally, we briefly discuss some particularities of the core racket theory texts before concluding. Translations from additional German sources are our own.</p> <h2 id="the-beginnings-of-racket-theorie">The Beginnings of ‘Racket Theorie’</h2> <p>In the development of early Critical Theory as a whole, racket theory is in many respects the successor to the Institute’s 1930s socio-psychological studies on the role of ‘authority,’ defined as the psychological internalization of class domination,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in modern society, which culminated in the 1936 publication of <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em>. The remaining members of the Institute—specifically Horkheimer, Adorno, Löwenthal, and Paul Massing—would return to the more general problematic of ‘authority’ and ‘authoritarianism’ in the late 1940s with the <em>Studies in Prejudice</em> series that Horkheimer edited with Samuel Flowerman for the American Jewish Committee, and especially in <em>The Authoritarian Personality</em> (1950), where Adorno would build off of the same Frommian concept of the authoritarian character structure that grounded the 1936 <em>Studien</em>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p> <p>Horkheimer’s essays “The Jews and Europe” (1939) and “Authoritarian State” (1940) were also important precursors to the racket theory project. These two essays touch on many themes that would reappear a few years later in the racket theory corpus: fundamental commonalities between fascism and liberal capitalism, the decline of law and return of direct domination, the worthlessness of reformism, etc. The essential difference between these essays and the racket theory corpus is the absence of any unifying concept in the former. From 1942, the concept of the racket would quickly come to fill this role in both their short- and long-form reflections on economics and politics. It would serve as the term mediating between their presentation of the constant of impersonal domination in capitalist society as a totality and the variable forms of more personal or direct domination through which the former increasingly found expression in the everyday lives of the subjects of late capitalism.</p> <p>The story of the racket concept in particular begins with the final issue of the Institute for Social Research’s official journal, <em>Studies in Philosophy and Social Science</em>—the short-lived (1939-1942) English-language successor to their <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> (1932-1939)—in Summer 1941, which has retrospectively become known as the “State Capitalism” issue (Nos. 2 and 3 of Vol. IX), named after the central idea of Friedrich Pollock’s two controversial contributions: “State Capitalism: Its Possibilities and Limitations” and “Is National Socialism a New Order?” Though Horkheimer and Adorno’s work from this period has traditionally been interpreted as an extension of Pollock’s state capitalism thesis, such readings almost entirely ignore the substantial critiques both Horkheimer and Adorno level against Pollock’s theory—largely in agreement with the better-known critiques of Neumann and Kirchheimer—in the ensuing debate over whether the Institute should publish the text at all.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> This confrontation with Pollock’s theory was a crucial ingredient in the development of the racket theory project.</p> <p>The final issue of <em>Studies</em> opens with Horkheimer’s essay “The End of Reason,” which was written in close collaboration with Adorno. In the Horkheimer Archive, amidst the drafts for “End of Reason,” there are a number of excerpts, with unique handwritten corrections and notes for revision, from one section of the essay in particular under the title “Racket Theorie.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> This passage seems to have acquired a newfound, retrospective significance for Horkheimer and Adorno as they worked on the earliest drafts of the <em>Fragmente</em> in Spring and Summer 1942. The excerpt provides a provisional definition of the racket as a form of social domination—“[p]rotection is the archetype of domination”—after its violent historical reappearance in the transition from the “interlude” free market liberalism to monopoly capitalism: “Monopolism has […] led social domination back to its true nature which had continued to operate only where the humane form of domination had left some loopholes to inhumanity.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> The passage concludes with the earliest formulation of a research program devoted to the racket itself: “A study of such border phenomena as racketeering may offer useful parallels for understanding certain developmental tendencies in modern society.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> The apparent marginality of racketeering relative to the monopolistic planning of states is exactly what made the racket so promising as a model for the explanation of monopoly.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p> <h2 id="thwarted-plans-for-publication">Thwarted Plans for Publication</h2> <p>Prompted by internal debates opened during the composition and publication of the “State Capitalism” issue, Horkheimer prepared a memo (the “LA Memo”) in April 1942 about the ‘non-philosophical’ problems—many of them related to so-called state capitalism—that would have to be tackled in his planned book on dialectics, which would eventually become <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>. The word ‘racket’ only appears once in memo, indicating that it was not yet the focal concept for the planned work. A slightly earlier letter to Felix Weil from March of ‘42 related Horkheimer’s desire to recruit Weil as well as Friedrich Pollock (and perhaps Henryk Grossmann and Arkady Gurland) to assist with writing the sociological-economic part of the dialectics book.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p> <p>By the Summer of ‘42, Horkheimer and Adorno had begun work on what would become <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, and they were increasingly aware that an extended treatment of their new thinking about class, authority, and the economy would not fit in the ‘dialectics book.’ This was largely due to the fact that the theory of the racket was conceived from the beginning as a multidisciplinary project, something Horkheimer and Adorno could not accomplish without collaborators in political science, law, and economics. In August of ‘42, they—probably Adorno working on the basis of prior discussions with Horkheimer—produced another memo (“Notes for the Programme of the Book”) outlining their plans for an independent book on what they were now calling “racket theory”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> or “sociology of rackets.”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Inspired by this second memo, Adorno quickly drafted the essay “Reflections on Class Theory,” a text which he told Horkheimer could be “readily broken up and transferred to different places in the end product [i.e. the planned book] as needed.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p> <p>The rudimentary plan of these memos gestated into more concrete plans for a 1943 yearbook—presumably a continuation of or successor to <em>Studies in Philosophy and Social Science</em>—that would include contributions from the likes of Arkady Gurland, Herbert Marcuse, Franz Neumann, and Otto Kirchheimer. Kirchheimer’s contribution would be about “rackets in the labor movement” and “analyze the differences between industrial monopolies and the trade unions,” while Neumann would write “a study on the possibilities of political forms which do not have the character of rackets” and Gurland’s essay would deal with “certain statistical data with regard to the changes in the working classes.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Marcuse’s contribution was presumably to be the essay he was working on at the time, a study of “how new forms of control, manipulation, and behavior express themselves in the language of this age” entitled “Operational Thinking and Social Domination.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Horkheimer confided in Marcuse that he “[had] the feeling that the realization of this plan would be the first step toward giving [sic] a piece of Critical Theory which would not be purely philosophical.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>There were, however, some significant problems with this plan. As Thomas Wheatland has shown in <em>The</em> <em>Frankfurt School In Exile</em>, the Institute for Social Research’s affiliation with Columbia University, which facilitated the former’s emigration to the United States in 1934, was contingent on both the Institute’s financial autonomy and the continuation of their pre-existing social research using quantitative and empirical methods.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> With the Horkheimer circle’s bitter break with Erich Fromm, the leading empirical social researcher of the group, in 1939 and the Institute’s rapidly worsening financial situation, they had become incapable of fulfilling either of Columbia’s desiderata by the outbreak of WWII.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> In addition to recurrent suspicions towards the Institute core’s Marxist, or even communist, sympathies<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and an undisclosed quota system that limited the number of Jewish faculty members,<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> a more permanent affiliation between the Institute and Columbia’s sociology department was endangered by the latter’s internal disputes over its own direction and leadership between 1939 and 1942. After the Institute failed to secure a source of external funding for any of the ambitious group research projects it proposed in this period, Horkheimer, who had since moved to Los Angeles in Spring 1941, finally responded to Columbia’s reluctance to support the Institute beyond offering a teaching appointment to Franz Neumann in 1942 by making the decision to radically downsize the Institute in late 1942.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> The lack of any institutional affiliation meant that funding for the yearbook would be hard to come by.</p> <p>At the same time, several of the contributing authors—Marcuse, Neumann, and Kirchheimer—had recently obtained gainful employment at the Research &amp; Analysis branch of the United States Office of Strategic Services and would have little time to complete their projected contributions.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> On top of these two problems, one of the major planned contributors, Henryk Grossmann, found himself increasingly at odds with the inner circle of the Institute both theoretically and interpersonally.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Plans were quickly scaled back from a full-fledged yearbook to a smaller mimeographed edition,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> but even this apparently proved unfeasible. Otto Kirchheimer actually completed his essay and wound up getting “In Quest of Sovereignty” published in <em>The Journal of Politics</em> in May 1944 after it became clear that the Institute’s publication plans had come to naught. Marcuse would eventually repurpose some of his work from “Operational Thinking…” for <em>One Dimensional Man</em>.</p> <p>That’s as far as plans for publication in book form got, but Horkheimer also produced a series of fragments related to the racket idea and a substantial essay on the topic. While we know that Horkheimer started work on his fragments in 1942, the exact date is not entirely clear. The most likely possibility is that at least some of them were started in Spring or Summer 1942 and thus provided a rough conceptual basis for the subsequent racket theory texts. It is also unclear what exactly Horkheimer planned to do with these fragments: whether they were intended for publication or merely a means for internal theoretical edification or etc.</p> <p>In early 1943, Horkheimer began writing a more cohesive essay on racket theory, hoping against hope that he still might be able to produce the planned yearbook or at least find some outlet for the racket idea. The text received the deceptively unimaginative title “On the Sociology of Class Relations” and would only be published in full posthumously. Horkheimer sent out copies of an early draft to various Institute associates—Marcuse, Kirchheimer, and Neumann—for feedback in September 1943 and produced a finished draft on the basis of their feedback shortly afterwards. “Sociology of Class Relations” stands out as the most integrated and wide-ranging text in the entire racket theory corpus.</p> <p>Horkheimer continued to periodically revise the fragments with input from Adorno until Spring 1944, when they were all, with the sole exception of “On the Ideology of Politics Today,” compiled together in a staple-bound typed booklet (complete with a table of contents, pagination, and a prefatory note) under the title “Concepts as a Supplement to the Festschrift for Friedrich Pollock.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> As that title suggests, this compilation was a companion volume to the original <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em> version of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, which Horkheimer and Adorno had dedicated to their friend and collaborator Pollock on the occasion of his 50th birthday. The preface to the <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em> would also be the first and last time that “On the Sociology of Class Relations” was mentioned in print. Adorno and Horkheimer explained that the essay was excluded along with “all English works produced in the same period, regardless of their connection to the fragments,” but nevertheless belonged to the “whole work” which they “[hoped] to complete… in the not too distant future.”<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p> <p>After the limited ‘publication’ (so to speak) of the “Concepts” and the <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em>, Horkheimer and Adorno shelved the racket theory texts for a few years. They eventually returned to them in 1946-1947 while preparing the new edition of what was now titled <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> for publisher Querido and, slightly later, Horkheimer’s book <em>Eclipse of Reason</em>. Among the extensive changes they made to the text of <em>Dialectic</em> for the Querido edition, the fragment “Strafgefangene” (or “Prisoners”) from the “Concepts” was incorporated into the fragment “From ‘A Theory of the Criminal,’” itself a lengthy excerpt from the full “Theory of the Criminal” of the “Concepts.” Beyond this, none of the older, unpublished work was included.</p> <p>“On the Sociology of Class Relations” fared slightly better. In 1946, substantial sections of it were revised and repurposed for Chapter IV of Horkheimer’s <em>Eclipse of Reason</em>, “Rise and Decline of the Individual.”<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> Among the most radical of these revisions was the elimination of the concept of the “racket” from the text entirely.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> The publication of <em>Eclipse</em> marked the end of the Horkheimer and Adorno’s attempts to publish their writings on the racket from the early 1940s,<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> though not the end of their preoccupation with the problem of the disappearance of socialist internationalism with the ‘racketization’ of the labor movement.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p> <h2 id="the-reflexivity-of-racket-theory">The Reflexivity of Racket Theory</h2> <p>Much of the authoritative secondary literature on racket theory to date has approached these early sketches searching for some basic incoherence that is meant to explain why the project would ultimately remain unfinished.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> However, the points of incoherence often imputed to racket theory under the assumption of its necessary failure prove to be the same problems the critical theorists consciously adopted as their point of departure for the reflexive contextualization and construction of racket theory from the beginning.</p> <p>From its inception in “The End of Reason,” the concept of the racket has a paradoxical historical status: in the transition of modern capitalist society from “liberalism” to “monopolism,” the ‘archetype’ and ‘true nature’ of social domination that remains the condition of class society, i.e., ‘prehistory’ as a whole, is revealed.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> In each of their subsequent contributions to racket theory, Horkheimer and Adorno will contextualize their theoretical efforts both within the process of ‘racketization’ society undergoes in the transition from ‘liberal’ to ‘monopoly’ capitalism and in the ‘negative invariance’<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> of human prehistory as a whole. Closing his first thesis of his essay devoted to rackets, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942), Adorno formulates the historical discovery of prehistory in the language of the <em>Manifesto</em>: “All history is the history of class struggles because it was always the same thing, namely, prehistory.”<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> The last line of Horkheimer’s “On the Sociology of Class Relations” (1943) is a direct interpolation from Marx’s remarks on the method of political economy from the ‘Introduction’ to the <em>Grundrisse</em>: “the anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the ape.”<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> In a letter to Felix Weil from January 1943, Horkheimer explains: “The meaning of that truth is that once we know man, we can discover his beginnings in earlier forms of life. Once Fascism had developed in European society, we now are able to find its hallmarks in earlier stages of human history, but it would be an error to say that, because of those traces, the development was a necessary one.”<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> Throughout the fragments, the racket will appear under the dual aspect of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic,’ historical variable and prehistorical constant, according to this parallax. This accounts for the centrality of the problem of law in the sketches on racket theory, and more specifically on what Evgeny Pashukanis called “indissoluble internal connection between the categories of the economy based on the commodity and on money, and the legal form itself.”<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> For the subject of modern social domination is in the end neither the state as collective capitalist nor the conspiracy of the rackets, but “the unconscious colossus of real existence, subjectless capitalism, [which] inflicts its destruction blindly.”<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p> <p>In a pair of letters written in February 1943, Horkheimer is clear: the theoretical perspective required for racket theory is none other than the Marxian critique of political economy, which alone makes it possible for the social theorist to “to deprive liberalism of the weapon to think of itself as of the ‘natural’ economic system and to show up the identity of the meta-economic structure of both the present day collective and the old free market system.”<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> The twist, however, is that the Marxian theory of social totality becomes illegible in the fragmentation of the social sciences into a system of rackets this theory is needed to critique: “This is what the critique of political economy, which established dialectical relations between the totality of the social sciences, has become among these academic groups, a kind of dealing between the different rackets which confirm one another that they are indispensable.”<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> The same ‘racketization’ of society in the transition from free-market, ‘liberal’ capitalism to monopoly capitalism that underlies and drives the development of racket theory simultaneously undermines and frustrates the intelligibility of the theory itself. For Horkheimer and Adorno, the false modesty of epistemological pluralism which posits the <em>a priori</em> insurmountability of the division of labor in the sciences is as vicious as the pre-established harmony of the sciences was in the dogmatic philosophical systems of the past. The dispute unfolding within the social sciences between special-scientific pluralism and the renaissance of metaphysical holism is interpreted as a refractory expression of a generalized social crisis characterized by the simultaneous fragmentation and consolidation of political rackets. The lack of conscious coordination between the sciences is the reverse side of an unconscious agreement each has with the existing order of society. This reality became increasingly pressing for the racket theorists in the 1940s as they found themselves increasingly forced to seek funding from various government and non-profit ‘rackets’ whose patronage was conditional on the silence of critical theory towards the total mobilization of American society during WWII. The content of racket theory rebounds on its form.</p> <p>In a letter written in August, 1942, on the style of his collaborations with Adorno, Horkheimer writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>I’m far from imagining that our thought could “break through in America” … . We no longer hope for more than that, should the day finally break, what we’ve written will be but a small star, flickering, though barely visible, in the horrific night of the present. For what else should the gaze which stares into the fireworks of magazines and the other slick products of scientific and unscientific mass culture see when it turns away from it all if not darkness? … Any theses of ours, as the guiding principles of a successful publication, would at best only add a new shading of color to the bouquet of rockets.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The degree to which their stylistic experimentation during the composition of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> was influenced by their conception of the racket as a form of social domination has yet to be fully explored.</p> <h2 id="additional-remarks-on-the-texts-and-their-content">Additional Remarks on the Texts and their Content</h2> <p>As mentioned above, all of the fragments that we are translating and publishing here were all included in a booklet except for “On the Ideology of Politics Today.” Before discussing the content of the fragments from the “Concepts” compilation, some attention must be given to this particular fragment. While this fragment is incomplete—it breaks off mid-sentence—it still contains a particularly pointed criticism of Friedrich Pollock’s theory of state capitalism, one which has prompted previous interpreters to attempt—unsuccessfully, in our view—to direct the criticism away from Pollock himself.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p> <p>The five fragments from the “Concepts” that we selected for translation and publication are all closely related on a thematic level. In particular, they dedicate significant space to analyzing the conflicted relation between rackets and law—both concepts serving as synecdoches for specific forms of domination. The particularism of the racket is also its “fundamental illegality;”<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> it is the antithesis of the abstract, universal domination of law. Despite the apparent conflict between rackets and law, they are inseparably bound together in reality. The state’s justice is founded by and can only be administered by rackets; law in class society is “set in pre-established harmony with the rule of cliques which hold weapons and means of production.”<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> Its apparent universality is set up for the advantage of a particular class. The law has an elective affinity with money, commodities, and private property. In spite of the universal validity of both forms, the sanctions of law gravitate towards the poor in particular just as commoditized wealth goes to the rich. Thus rackets and law are in a chiasmic relation of speculative identity and non-identity: rackets found the law; law is foundered on rackets.</p> <p>The figure of the criminal holds a special place in this tortuous interplay of universal and particular. The criminal is punished for transgressing the universally binding restrictions that enable collective survival in the state—the so-called common good—in the interests of their own benefit. But, as Horkheimer argues, “[t]he enemy is never the object of punishment, for it is always administered to the defenseless.”<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> Thus, punishment does not follow the logic of self-defense taught by Hobbes: it is an impassioned act of revenge against someone already disarmed that reveals the “illegality of the law.”<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> Law constitutes itself as human society’s defense against nature, but behind this rationalistic alibi is the same cruelly natural fate it was supposed to prevent: painful death without reason.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup></p> <p>Another form of false universality and unity assumed by the racket is the fascist ‘collective’ or ‘community.’ Whatever internal unity such a formation possesses must be placed in the context of its violent competition with other ‘collectives’ and suppression of the outcasts unlucky enough to be excluded from the benefits of any racket. Of course, this aforementioned unity is also largely transient, if not entirely illusory. Such ‘collectives’ are invariably characterized by violently enforced internal hierarchies and struggle within each level of their hierarchy. The racketized form of collectivity is present also in the working class in the shape of the reformist unions and parties that narrowly seek after privileges for their members. This is not an inevitable result, but rather a betrayal—one that leads to the destruction of its all-too-clever perpetrator.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>Turning our attention to the two memos, we must recognize that these are somewhat special documents, as they were not intended for external promulgation. We have chosen to translate and publish them because they provide unique insight into the Frankfurt School’s racket theory project and their internal working process more generally.</p> <p>The “LA Memo” (“On parts of the Los Angeles work program that cannot be carried out by the philosophers”) is difficult to date exactly, but it is definitely from some point in April 1942. The document is of special interest because of its strikingly clear formulation of the sociological and economic problems motivating the Institute’s research at the time. The language used in the memo indicates that it dates to the period when Horkheimer and Adorno still believed that a treatment of racket theory could fit into the ‘dialectics book.’ The “Notes for the Programme of the Book,” dated August 20th, 1942, were accompanied by thirty sheets of “excerpts from texts on the history of rackets” (seemingly compiled by Adorno) from September 15th, 1942.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> These excerpts were mostly from works from or about Ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy that dealt with topics relevant to the themes of the racket theory project (political power, state violence, etc).</p> <p>Both of these internal documents show the Institute’s continued interest in synthetic interdisciplinary social research that would incorporate history, philosophy, economics, sociology, and psychoanalysis. It also indirectly shows the difficulties of such a project. The ambitious outline found in “Notes for the Programme of the Book” recalls the similarly ambitious 1934 plans for <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em>, plans which the Institute was still incapable of fulfilling then despite having more financial resources at their disposal as well as actual stable working relationships between all the major contributors.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p> <p><br/></p> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketTexts/">Read the Fragments and Texts on Racket Theory</a></p> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ClassRelations/">Read “On the Sociology of Class Relations”</a></p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <p><br/></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>See <a href="https://jamescrane.substack.com/i/161511932/translators-note-reconstructing-the-formation-of-the-encore">James Crane, “Translator’s note: Reconstructing the Formation of the <em>Encore</em>.” in <em>Substudies</em> (blog), 4/18/2025</a> <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>MHA Na 1 <a href="https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/horkheimer/content/titleinfo/5668657">639</a>, [39]-[218]. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Max Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family” [1936] in <em>Critical Theory: Selected Essays</em> (Continuum, 2002), 68-69. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>For more on Erich Fromm’s importance for the Freudo-Marxist ‘analytic social psychology’ of the early Frankfurt School, see J.

Legal ownership was the ideological expression of the fact that a minority of people occupied a position which enabled them to exclude the rest of society from freely using the land or other instruments necessary for the continuation of social life on a given scale. The ruling class has absorbed the gifts of culture, that is to say, the difference between the total product of consumer goods and the bare necessities of life of those who produced them, and, though guided itself by controlled social forces, has determined the kind of goods to be made and the methods to be used.</p> <p>The privileges thus held by the ruling minorities throughout the ages were not altogether irrational. It is true that, in the last analysis, they were conquered and maintained by force; but the fact that the groups which enjoyed them were able to make use of that force for the organization and stabilization of some robust form of society was a sign of their being economically more advanced. Their rules promoted and conserved a mode of production which, at its hey-day was not inadequate to the developmental status of the productive forces. In this respect, the rulers represented a higher rationality than the rest of the population. In the later periods of their reigns, when the principles of organization, which they represented, were made obsolete by the progress of other parts of the population, their power became more convulsive and terroristic but, at the same time, became weaker and hence more irrational, finally approaching blind despotism. They were transformed into purely repressive factors. The social and cultural forms for which they stood, wearily maintained by their administrative apparatus against new possibilities of human association, exercised a mutilating effect upon the minds and faculties of mankind.</p> <p>The notion of class as it underlies the materialistic theory of history needs further elucidation. It does not refer to a consistent and homogenous unity. At least during the most typical periods, property of the means of production was not identical with their well-planned social use, nor with the existence of a unified will and determination. The various ruling groups understood each other fairly well whenever it was necessary to crush the resistance of the exploited masses or of any forces threatening to set up a new social rule. Thus, when it came to punitive measures against the progressive burghers of Southern France or even against the proletarian elements in Flanders, the worldly and spiritual powers of the Middle Ages, emperors, kings, and popes, forgot their traditional conflicts for the time being and united for the defense of the prevailing hierarchical system of society. However, medieval history offers no picture of solidarity among the rulers of the Christian world. On the contrary, there was a never ending fight over booty going on among the different hierarchical groups. Each wanted to assume authority over large areas in order to be nourished and housed and served by as large a population as possible. The same holds good for the ruling groups of Greek antiquity, as represented by the city-states and factions. The ruling class, held together by the common interest in its specific mode of exploitation has always been characterized by its internal struggles, by the efforts of one of its parts to secure the spoils that others might appropriate. The struggle for security among the elite has been a race for the most far-reaching command possible, in other words, for control of production.</p> <p>For several reasons this nature of class was obscured during the 19th century. The emancipation of the bourgeoisie from the restrictions of mercantilism and the release of the laborer from serfdom seemed to have abolished the insurmountable differences among the various sectors of humanity. Economic competition embracing all parts of the population was more peaceful although more thorough and universal than the quarrels and discords of the great in times past. [It was one of the achievements of Marx’s writings that he,]<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> while stressing the progressive features of capitalism, unveiled its oppressive character and showed the old issue of power behind the apparently rational set-up of the market system. Today the similarity of the different historical phases of the bourgeois economy with regard to the principle of exploitation tends to become manifest. Even academic economists are shifting from the optimistic concept of an economy gravitating towards sheer harmony to a pessimistic power theory. Formerly they blamed Marx for the introduction of the “non-economic” concept of exploitation. Now they go much too far in the vindication of non-economic factors. They tend to replace economy by a more than simple political or psychological explanation of present-day events.</p> <p>In fact, the idea of competition as it was conceived in liberalistic theory was misleading in many respects, two of them being particularly important for the theory of class relations. First, the nature of competition among workers was essentially different from the nature of competition among capitalists. Competition among workers, at least during the heyday of liberalism, simply meant that there were so many workers that wages could hardly rise above the cost of bare living, and in many cases even dropped below it. This comes to the fore in the nature of the labor contract. Fascism has only revealed what was already inherent in liberalism: the delusive nature of the labor contract as a deal between partners equally free. It would be a grave theoretical mistake to denounce the contract in modern totalitarianism as a mere formality, and stress its genuine authenticity under liberalism. In both phases of the economic system, the aim of the contract may well be considered as the maintenance of that same basic inequality which is shrouded in its democratic language.</p> <p>Second, the monopolization of certain key positions within capitalist competition is much older than the monopolistic economy. Competition among the entrepreneurs themselves was never quite as free as it seemed. Here we are not thinking of state interference with industry, which economists are wont to [reproach]<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> as long as big business does not take the state under its own management. We have in mind rather the inequality resulting from the different degrees of social power exercised by various industries. Such differences depend largely upon the stage of economic concentration and centralization of the respective industries, upon its importance for the regular functioning of the economic life of the nation, and upon its affiliation with the military and administrative power apparatus. Therefore, the groups which by birth or deceit, brutality or shrewdness, expertness in engineering machinery or human relations, by marriage or adulation, have come into control of a part of the total capital invested in industry, form a hierarchy of economic power which has limited the free play of competition at each of its stages. The discovery that the national economy of various capitalistic countries depended upon 200, 60, or even a smaller number of families, brought this situation into a clear light which eventually made the veil of free competition transparent.</p> <p>The development of capitalistic society according to its own inherent tendencies caused the progressive traits of competition to disappear. It severed the link between the needs of consumers and the profit-interest of the individual entrepreneur; it diminished the possibility, slight as it was, of an independent mind gaining access to an independent position; it reduced the number of relatively autonomous economic subjects, who by the very fact of that plurality had an interest in the functioning of general law and in its impartial administration. All this vanishes in the later stages of capitalism and allows society to revert to more direct forms of domination, which in fact never had been quite suspended. Yet this process is not only a reactionary one. While the inequalities among the entrepreneurs are shifting into monopolistic and eventually totalitarian control of national life, the relation between Capital and Labor undergoes a most characteristic change. During the latest phase of capitalism, the working class has entered competition by adapting itself to the monopolistic structure of society. It has assumed a form which fits into the monopolistic set-up. Consequently its relationships to the different capitalistic groups are no longer radically different from those prevailing among the capitalistic groups themselves.</p> <p>The new situation is expressed in the concept of Labor (with a capital <em>L</em>) as it is recognized as a guiding intellectual principle not only in the minds of workers but also with the general public. Like Agriculture or Industry, or even sections of Industry, such as Steel, Rubber, and Oil, Labor is a collective term which is not an ordinary <em>abstractum</em> or <em>generale</em>. With regard to the individual elements included in their logical structure, such entities resemble a unit like State, Nation, Church, rather than a generality like Color, or Animal. They emphasize the concreteness of themselves as universal concepts, and disregard the elements of which they are comprised. Their logical structure mirrors exactly their objects. It stresses the collective individualities at the expense of the single individuals absorbed by them. The logical elements of the collective concept of Labor, i.e. the mass of ordinary members, are not the forces which, by their own ideas and spontaneity, determine the course of the whole. To use mathematical terminology, they are not so much the constant value with regard to the whole as the fluctuating one. On the contrary, the whole, i.e., the organization, determines and even overawes the individual, for the leaders, with their specific materialistic and power interests, with their philosophy and character structure, have an infinitely greater weight than any plain member.</p> <p>There is a decisive difference between the social units of our monopolistic society and those of earlier periods.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> All these older units are totalities in the sense that they are thoroughly organized, integrated, and ruled by a hierarchy. In contrast to modern totalities, however, the life of the totemistic tribe, the clan, the church of the Middle Ages, the nation in the era of the bourgeois revolutions, took their course according to mythological patterns which had assumed their shape in long historical developments. The patterns had become fixed images and models for the totalities, as did the Gospel for the church. True, such patterns, magical, religious, or philosophical, were intellectual authorities of the then present forms of domination. They reflected, as it were, the hierarchical stratification of society. But while they formed a cultural binding-substance which maintained a social formation even when its role in production had become obsolete, they also preserved the idea of human solidarity. This they did by the very fact that they objectified spiritual structures. Any system of ideas as far as it’s written in meaningful language, whether religious, artistic, or logical, has a general connotation and pretends to be true in a universal sense.</p> <p>To be sure, the objectivity and universality of the older collective units formed an ideology which constituted an essential condition of their parasitic existence in the body of society. But the patterns of organizations such as the medieval church did not directly coincide with the forms of material life. Organization in the strictest sense applied mainly to the hierarchy itself and to the ritual functions of both clergy and laity. Apart from that, neither life itself nor the intellectual framework by which it was reflected was completely integrated. The basic spiritual categories were not entirely fused with pragmatic considerations. Thus they maintained a certain element of independence and autonomy. They were not ready-made factory products, no plastic molds simply superimposed by the organization. The participation of the layman in the activities of such bodies remained separate from his daily work and life. There was still a cleavage between culture and production. This cleavage left more loopholes than the modern type of super-organization which virtually reduces the individual to a mere center of reaction. Modern universals, such as Labor, are integral parts of a unified social and economic system controlled by monopolies. By the very means of such universals, monopolies absorb the individual entirely and transform him into an element of the mechanism of production in which the so-called culture is only a cog. In short, the older forms of totalities which professed to comply with an aloof spiritual model, contained an element which is lacking in the purely pragmatistic totalities of monopolism. The latter also show a hierarchical structure – and are strictly integrated and despotic totalities but the ascent of their functionaries to the upper grade has nothing to do with any quality of theirs with regard to an objective spiritual content but almost exclusively with their ability to impose on people, to handle people, to be clever with people. Purely administrative and technical qualities define the human forces governing modern totalities. Such traits were by no means lacking in leaders of the different sectors of ancient classes, but by their radical separation from any autonomous idea. These traits give the modern totality its particular character.</p> <p>The concept of labor as a pragmatic totality becomes quite clear when compared with the proletariat as conceived by Marx. For him, the workers were the masses of all exploited people in industrialist society. In spite of all the minor differences of their individual fates, each of them, on the whole, had the same outlook on life: periods of employment would become shorter, the pressure of the “reserve army” on wages grow stronger, and misery, in the midst of an ever wealthier society, become unbearable. Marxian theory predicted that the capitalists would become less and less able to grant even a bare existence to the majority of the population. This trend would be expressed in the life of the average worker by a decay of his whole situation, by a deepening of his poverty, by growing hopelessness and despair. The economic pressure resulting from this state of affairs, together with the enlightenment of the workers achieved by their role in the modern productive process, would lead the formation of a party which would finally change the world. This party would spring from the similarity of the conditions of the workers all over the world. Its principles and structure would not be so much concerned with the temporary differences in their financial situation in various branches of production or various geographical and national settings. It would not express so much the actual conscience of the individual worker as affected by all the mutilating influences of exploitation. Essentially, it would embody the resistance against the frustrations imposed upon man by social forms which had become purely oppressive. It would not be based upon psychological factors but upon the objective tendency of the economic system. The efforts of this party would be inspired by the fulfillment of just those human aspirations, material and spiritual, which were suppressed and distorted by the modern industrial process which has made the individual a kind of accessory to machinery. The party’s aims were to be connected with the plight of the individual and the masses, and had no special affinity to any particular category of workers at the expense of others. It represented the oppressed masses as a whole. Since the reason for the laborer’s frustrations was not considered to be found in any specific defect of capitalism but in the very principle of class-rule, the efforts of the workers’ party were to be guided at each stage by the objective idea of abolishing that rule and the establishing of true community.</p> <p>This plan, however, was burdened from the very beginning of labor movements with an intrinsic difficulty. While the workers had to bear the full pressure of this society, whose tendency was to keep them below the minimum standard of living, they had to struggle daily in order to keep themselves alive. This meant that they kept alive a society whose rulers became stronger and stronger through the appropriated labor of the proletariat. Thus, the concept of class struggle always had these two connotations: the abolition of the wage system as such, and the attainment of higher wages within that system. It was the latter down-to-earth activity which once was conceived as the necessary stepping stone to revolution, as, for instance, through the general strike. The obsolescence of the latter idea is only one symptom of the fundamental change that has occurred. The class struggle has been transformed into a system of trade between monopolistic units, into a means of class adaptation, and into wars. Formerly, the relationship between daily struggle and revolutionary aim determined the whole labor movement, at least in continental Europe. Critical theory decided which way was to be taken in each situation. However, the struggling class was never “integrated” into one more competitor in the hunt for surplus value. The party was decidedly not concerned with the increase of its members’ incomes, nor the income or career or social position of its leaders. Working for and even adhering to that party meant the renunciation of all such things. Party members were an avant-garde of the working class for the very reason that such principles could be understood and assimilated only by relatively advanced elements of the working class. They were supposed to control the leaders very closely, and the criterion of that control was supposed to be not the avant-garde’s own wishes and needs, but the common interest of the working class in all countries, as the avant-garde was able to understand it. The tremendous majority of the proletariat was composed of individuals who, in their own psychology, expressed the mutilating effect of exploitation rather than the idea of a free humanity. The party, in spite of, even because of its antagonism to the majority of the masses represented, thought of itself as the genuine conscience of that same majority. Because the masses were unable to concretize their true interests, the party, in its decisions, had to rely on the theory of capitalistic society.</p> <p>Social theory was the heir to the older systems of thought which were supposed to have set the rules for past totalities. These older systems had vanished because the prevailing forms of solidarity proclaimed by them had proven to be treacherous. Unlike the medieval doctrine of the church or the liberalistic apology of the market system, proletarian theory of capitalism did not glorify its subject. It looked upon capitalism as the final form of domination. In no way did it justify the established ideas and superstitions of those whom it guided. In contrast to the tendencies of today’s mass culture, it did not sell the people their own way of living, which they unconsciously abhorred, but overtly acclaimed. Proletarian theory was the critical analysis of reality including the worker’s own warped thoughts. The locus of theory was the difference between the objective interest of the exploited class and the immediate interest of the individual workers: The more this difference is obscured by the existing social set-up, the more theory tends to vanish. Even when the actual masses were hostile to the party, they felt its theory linked them with their own ultimate interests. The party was not above the masses as the labor-leaders of today are above the laborers whom they integrate into their organizational patterns. The proletariat itself remained somewhat amorphous and chaotic, composed of individual subjects. Although deprived as they were of their human qualities by being transformed into mere elements of production, they had not yet become statistical figures of organizations. The character of the individual was not quite replaced by that of the member, defined exclusively by its standardized interests. Around the middle of the 19th century, the non-integrated nature of the individual worker as a part of an amorphous proletariat of the disinherited peasant or artisan, and his retrogressiveness in terms of the ever increasing rational “socialization” (<em>Vergesellschaftung</em>) of society was inseparably bound up with his “progressiveness” in the sense of revolution. [It is significant that, even today, worker’s organizations which are with some justification labeled as “backward” both theoretically and economically have proven to be the most spontaneous elements in critical situations, such as the Spanish Civil War.]<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p> <p>However, the clock cannot be put back nor can the organizational development be revoked or even theoretically rejected. The hope of the proletariat today does not consist of sticking to traditional party and civil war patterns. Rather, it must recognize and fight the monopolistic set-up of society infiltrating into the proletariat’s own organizations and infesting the minds of its individuals. In the 19th century concept of a future rational society the traits which expressed the planning, organizing, and centralizing functions in opposition to “chaotic” liberalistic economy prevailed over the traits expressing the plight of the individual. The workers’ parliamentary parties, which themselves were a product of liberalism and denounced liberalistic irrationality and promoted socialist economy in opposition to an anarchic capitalism. Under monopolism the other side of rationality has become manifest by its increasing suppression: the participation of all in the shaping of social life, equal chance to develop one’s own potentialities, equal security for all. Together with the rationalization of production, the idea of democracy calls for laying aside all fenced off economic positions, for establishing a world free from monopolies. The amorphism, by which the proletariat in the era of Marx and Engels differed fundamentally from any kind of totality, was the reason why, despite its being split into national groups, skilled and unskilled labor, employed and unemployed, its interests could become crystallized in a body such as the party. The trade union, though its role was not to be underestimated, had to subordinate its actions to the party’s strategy. The amorphism of the masses and its complement, theoretical thinking, both expressed in the party’s fight against exploitation as such, formed the contrast to the pragmatic totalities of today. The rise of workers from a passive role in the capitalistic process has been paid for with their complete integration.</p> <p>Labor in monopolistic society is itself a kind of monopoly: to be more exact, it is the monopoly of its leaders. [There are some decisive differences between Labor and capitalistic monopolies. The most important arises from the fact that each capitalistic monopoly constitutes some kind of economic unity which tries to appropriate as much surplus value as possible. The term Labor, however, comprises both the leaders who appropriate the profits and the members who create them. The same process which, both in reality and ideology, has made Labor an economic subject, has transformed the laborer, who was already the object of the entrepreneur, into the object of his organization as well. At the same time that ideology has become more realistic, more down-to-earth, its inherent contradiction to reality, its absurdity, has increased. While the masses think of themselves as the creators of their own destiny, the leaders use them as a commodity. The fact that Labor is a monopoly does not mean that its members, labor aristocracy excepted, are monopolists. It does mean that]<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> the leaders control labor supplies as the presidents of the big corporations control raw materials, machines, or other elements of production. Labor leaders trade on this kind of merchandise, manipulate it, advertise it, and try to fix its price as high as possible. Labor, becoming a trade among others, completes the process of the reification of the human mind. A man’s productive power today is not only bought by the factory and subordinated to the requirements of technology but rationed and managed by superior agencies of the Labor Movement. It is a double-barrelled transformation into things. With religious and moral ideologies fading and proletarian theory being abolished by the march of economic and political events,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> the conscience of the workers tends to become identical with the categories of their leaders’ trade. The idea of intrinsic antagonism between the international proletariat and any system of domination is completely superseded by the concepts connected with the disputes of power between the various monopolies. True, the proletarians of older days did not have any conceptual knowledge of the social mechanisms unveiled by theory, and their minds and souls bore the hallmarks of oppression. Yet, their misery was still the misery of single human beings and therefore connected them with any exploited mass in any country and in any sector of society. Their undeveloped minds were not kept in movement by the techniques of modern mass culture hammering the behavior patterns prevalent under monopolism into their eyes and ears and muscles during leisure time as well as during working hours (from which the so-called amusement period can hardly be differentiated anyway). Workers today as well as the public in general are intellectually better trained, better informed, and much less naive. They know the details of national affairs, and the tricks and crooked means typical of political movements, particularly of those which live from propaganda against corruption. The workers, at least those who have not gone through the hell of Fascism, will join in any persecution of a capitalist or politician who has been singled out because he violated the rules; but they do not question the rules themselves. They have learned to take the basic injustice of class society as a powerful fact and to take powerful facts as the only thing to be respected. Their minds are closed to dreams of a basically different world and to concepts which instead of being mere classifications of facts are formed under the aspect of real fulfillment of those dreams. Their childish belief in such things has been so drastically wiped out of their memory that now they stubbornly believe in reality as it is. Desperately, they repeat the commands which are knocked into the children’s systems when they try to open their eyes: there is only one way to live and that is the actual one, the one of hardboiled smartness; the things that seemed to be opposed to it are idle slogans, lies, metaphysics; he who is unable to adapt himself to this state of affairs, whether oneself or any other man, the badly adjusted, stupid one, is rightly doomed. Modern economic conditions make for a positivistic attitude in members as well as in leaders, in that they resemble each other more and more. [Such a transformation, although constantly challenged by tendencies in the opposite direction, strengthens Labor as a new force in social life.]<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p> <p>Not that inequality has decreased. Even statistics cannot hide the fact that the gap between the social power of a single worker and that of a single corporation president has widened and this difference is the real yardstick as far as social justice is concerned. And, while the unions, dealing in certain categories of labor, have been able to raise their prices, the whole weight of society is felt by other categories, organized or unorganized. There is, furthermore, the cleavage between members of unions and those who cannot afford to enter in them, between the members of privileged nations and those who, in this smaller-growing world, are exploited, not only by their own traditional elites, but also through the medium of these elites, by the ruling groups of the industrially more developed countries. The principle of exploitation has not changed at all. Marx’s prediction that private competitive industry would become increasingly unable to employ the bulk of the proletariat as wage earners in the production of consumer goods or machines for consumer goods has come true. As a consequence, the association of the masses against universal exploitation has been made even more difficult by the appearance of new antagonisms within the ranks of the oppressed masses themselves. The opposing interests of farmers and workers, colored and white labor, soldiers and civilians are complicated by those of the various categories of the employed. Since it is the trend of capitalistic society that ever greater parts of the middle classes lose their economic independence. This process engulfs almost the whole population. It forms a complement to the emancipation of large masses from economic stagnation and pauperization. The more the world becomes ripe for the realization of theoretical thought, the more theoretical thought and every human trait which points to it seem to vanish, and, wherever they become manifest, are wiped out pitilessly by ideological control mechanisms serving the monopolies both of Industry and of Labor. The conscious precautions taken by radio, press, and motion pictures are only a visible supplement to the unconscious trends necessitated by economic and social development. The persecution of any independent social thought represents none of the groups struggling for a greater share of power, and has no usefulness for any prevailing interest, is not only planned and practiced by the agencies of culture but takes place within each member of society. [There are however, some centers of resistance left within man. It is a counter-evidence against social pessimism that notwithstanding the continuous assault by collective patterns humanity is still alive, if not in the individual as a member of social groups at least in the individual as far as he is left alone.]<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p> <p>The power of collective patterns of monopolistic society goes far beyond the sphere of conscious influence. From the day of his birth, the individual is made to feel that there is only one way to get along in this world: by resigning his unlimited hope. This he can only achieve by imitation (<em>mimesis</em>). He continuously ruminates what he perceives around him not only consciously – he acquires judgment and notions much later – but with his whole being. Long before he can even speak, he echoes the gestures of the persons and things around him. Later on, he echoes the traits and attitudes of all the collectives at whose mercy he is: his family, his classmates, his athletic team and all the other teams which enforce a deeper conformity, a more radical surrender by complete assimilation than any father or teacher in the 19th century. By echoing, repeating, imitating the surroundings, by adapting himself to all the powerful groups to which he belongs, by transforming himself from a human being into a member of specific organized bodies, by reducing his potentialities to readiness and ability to conform to, and gain influence in, such bodies, he can finally manage to survive. It is survival by practicing the oldest biological means of survival: mimicry. Modern culture is a resurrection of oppressed mimetic practices. Just as the child repeats the words of his mother and the youngster, the brutality of his elders at whose hands he has suffered much, industrialized culture, the giant loudspeaker voice of monopolism, copies reality endlessly and boringly. All the ingenious devices of the amusement industry serve but to reproduce over and over again, without betraying the slightest revolt, scenes of life which are already dull and automatized when they happen in reality. Motion pictures, radio, popular biographies and novels shout incessantly the same rhythm: this is our groove, this is the rut of the great and the little ones, this is reality as it is and should be and will be. Even the words which could express a hope for something else than the fruits of success have been absorbed. On the one hand, beatitude – and everything which refers to the absolute – has been assimilated by confining the idea to religious edification as a leisure time function; it has become part of Sunday School vernacular. Happiness, on the other hand, has come to mean exactly the normal life of which thought, even religious thought, at certain times, contained a radical criticism. Language has been so thoroughly reduced to the function ascribed to it in positivistic theory; it has become just another tool in the giant apparatus of production in monopolistic society. Every sentence which is not equivalent to an operation in that apparatus appears to the layman just as meaningless as it is decried to be by contemporary semantics, whose doctrine actually implies that only the purely symbolic and the operational, that is, the purely senseless sentence makes sense. Under the pressure of the pragmatic totalities of today, man’s self-expression has become identical with his function in the prevailing system. Within himself as well as in others, man desperately represses any other impulse. Wherever he perceives an unadjusted longing, he feels an overwhelming wrath and fury, an utter rage which crashes down on everybody and everything which, by exhibiting the idea of complete fulfillment, forces him to curb and repress the longing anew. [It is just this spitefulness which indicates that humanity has not been completely absorbed by the repressive collectivization of man. It has a disquieting aspect for the rulers. In spite of their social and psychological victories, they sense that their hold over the masses is in jeopardy. This is why terror has to implement collectivization.]<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p> <p>In the earlier periods of bourgeois society as well as in the history of other forms of society, there existed a greater multitude of independent economic subjects who took care of their own individual property and maintained it against competitive social forces. Such times necessitated the fostering of relatively independent thought which by its very nature, its “objectivity,” is related to the interests of humanity. Against its own wishes, the society of middle class proprietors and, particularly, the professions related to the now-vanishing economic sphere of [distribution],<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> had to promote thinking which, whether they liked it or not, was antagonistic to class rule and domination. Today the individual in the course of his economic functions is never directly confronted with society. It is always his group, his association, his union, which takes care of his rights.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Therefore the very category of the individual, with its good and bad implications, is in a state of liquidation. Thought, unrelated to the interest of any established group, unrelated to the business of any industry, has lost its significance. It is considered vain and empty. That self same society which, in the fact of hunger and starvation in great areas of the world, leaves a considerable part of its machinery idle, that society which suppresses or shelves important inventions, and which, in the rare periods of full employment, devotes a tremendous part of its working hours to idiotic advertisements (for even what is left of culture boils itself down to advertisements and propaganda) or to the production of instruments of destruction, that self-same society to which these sinister luxuries are inherent, has made usefulness its gospel. Conversely it has stamped the only ultimate aim for which civilization could be useful, a luxury: truth as it envisages the realization of humanity instead of the domination of nature.</p> <p>However, the difference of the actual situation from other chapters of history should not be exaggerated. In the earlier periods mentioned above, the existence of independent thought in the middle classes was paid for by the miserable material condition of the working class even in the most highly developed countries. The revolutionary thinkers of the proletariat came from the middle- or upper-classes. Since that time, the working class as a whole has made tremendous progress. Its rationality, at least as far as it is able to express itself, is purely pragmatic, and therefore “particularistic,” like that of the rest of society; but the tremendous physical, organizational, and cultural pressure which is necessary to keep it in this state, the increased furor with which not only every trace of independent political practice but the expression of any independent thought or even the mere suspicion of the existence of such thought are hated and eventually persecuted, the hectic strengthening of all reactionary organizations and movements, betray the rising fear of the abolition of fear and repression. The feverish attempt to channel the ever greater fury which develops in the masses due to the necessity of repressing their own original longings, and to prevent that furor from being conquered by eventual insight into the ever increasing senselessness of that repression and into the real identity of human interests. Such channeling which has always been the business of the rulers, of their cultural and terroristic apparatus, has also become the business of labor organizations which, at the same time, lead labor into the struggle of competition and increase its strength. [The antagonism between the classes is reproduced within the structure of labor and especially within the labor unions themselves – although it is perhaps better veiled there than it ever has been in society as a whole. Docilely and without a hint of any opposing interests, the workers surrender part of their money to the mammoth trusts which trade in their labor.]<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p> <p>It is not so much the amount of the contributions which makes the labor leaders a kind of group of the ruling class, but the social control exercised by them on the basis of these contributions. Certainly a great part of their material interests is opposed to the interests of other competing groups but this holds true for all groups which have ever formed the ruling class: they all have fought each other. Their affinity springs from the source of their income. They all live on what they can grasp from the circulating surplus value. This also goes for the industrialist himself. The working hours under which his immediate supervision are spent on the production of surplus value do not correspond to the share he himself gets of the whole surplus value at the disposition of the ruling class. He receives his proof not as an industrialist but as a businessman; as such he has to compete with others in order to get as large an amount as possible out of the entire result of each production period. He is in the same position as those capitalists whose business is not directly productive, like the bankers, the entrepreneurs in the communications- or entertainment-industries, and all the liberal professions and activities [which are exercised by so-called ‘third persons.’]<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> All of them have to develop their skill of shrewd calculation, of not giving away everything without getting as much as possible in return, of becoming acceptable to stronger groups, of using their fellowman exclusively as a tool for strengthening their grip on society. This skill is not derived from conscious determination. People are determined to assume such an attitude towards life but awareness of their willingness stirs up counter-trends in their own minds and in the minds of the people upon whom they want to impose. The qualities necessary for ascent spring from the unconscious; they have become second nature in man. Be that as it may, these psychological qualities are indispensable. The liberalistic ideology that a man’s fate depends on the economic significance of his activity demands two corrections. First, economic significance in this society means usefulness not with regard to the needs of all but with regard to essential conditions of the hierarchy of power. In order to be allowed to live, the individual must prove his value to some of the groups which are engaged in their struggle for a greater share of control over national and international economy. Second, the quantity and quality of goods or services which an individual contributes to the wealth of society is but one of the factors which determine his success.</p> <p>The more the economy is rationalized the more obvious it becomes that the differences of intelligence needed for the various functions could easily be overcome by adequate training. Under such conditions adaptability to the prevailing power relations rather than any other personal trait becomes paramount. It has been the fallacy of technocratic thinking from St. Simon to Veblen to underestimate the similarity of promising character traits in the different branches of production and of business and to confound rational use of the means of production with rational inclinations of certain categories of its agents.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> The engineer, indeed, embodies progress. He looks at people not exclusively as means of profit-making. His function as commander is more directly linked to the requirements of the work itself; therefore, his orders bear on the signs of greater objectivity. His subordinates recognize at least part of his commands as founded in the nature of things and therefore rational in a universal sense. But even the essence of this rationality is not reason but domination. The engineer’s understanding of things regards none of their elements by which they can be handled and transformed – their weakest points, so to speak. He is not interested in things as they really are but as they can be fitted into schema completely alien to their own nature. In fact his methods of thinking, his categories, lead necessarily to the triumph of modern technology: the smashing of atoms. No one is considered as an aim, all are mere tools. His mind is that of class society in its streamlined form, without any ornaments. His purposeful rule would make humanity a mass of utopia without any purpose.</p> <p>The labor leaders have become an acquisitive group among others. The conditions under which they work are more difficult. It is not so easy for them as for the leaders of the big capitalist trusts to keep their doings from discussion by a public opinion which in the last analysis is controlled by the entrepreneurs. [The large masses of members with whom the labor magnates have to deal, plus certain basically democratic patterns inherent in all non-fascist labor organizations, do not allow for the same conspiratory techniques which have been employed so successfully by big business in all its national and international undertakings. This is why the labor bureaucracy tries to dispense with membership meetings as much as possible. Every ruling minority needs secrecy as a condition of its perpetuation. Despite all these essential differences, however, the similarity between the organized totality of Labor and other monopolies should not be underrated.]<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>Each of the capitalist, professional and labor groups exercise specific functions in the social process and each uses that function to get as large a share of power over men, goods and services as possible. There have been, throughout history, diverse methods employed in this struggle: competition, swindles, robbery, war. This struggle which, as pointed out in the beginning, characterizes the set-up of each ruling class as definitely in its role in production, has become a trait of the labor groups today. Although labor leaders cannot achieve any results without obtaining, at least temporarily, some advantages for the workers. But their own social and economic power, their own position and income (all these factors overwhelmingly superior to the power, position, and income of the individual worker) depend on the maintenance of capitalism. This economic fact holds true despite the great services they may render to their respective memberships. The entrepreneur’s activities too very often had a positive effect on the income of labor; higher incomes of the entrepreneurs are no more opposed to the interests of labor than higher incomes of the labor leaders. But there is now a new kind of solidarity between the old and the new elites; social history during the last decades has brought closer cooperation between them. The attitude of the great labor unions towards the State in the last several decades was similar to that of the big capitalistic organizations. They were concerned with preventing the government from mingling in their affairs. “No interference with or without our private business” was their doctrine.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> [It was the “<em>Herr im Hause</em>” standpoint.]<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> [In the meantime the increasing economic power of monopolies has made understanding the central government imperative for labor leaders, and the same understanding is important for the government.]<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> The integration of cooperative elements into the administration has made progress during the war. Society becomes a planned and regulated process, not with regard to great events (they still depend on blind forces resulting from the struggle between the classes and among the various ruling groups), but as far as the life of the individual is concerned; not in the sense of self-administration (the decisions are made as compromises among the prominent whose interests do not correspond to those of the rest of society) but with regard to a more streamlined performance of the material and human apparatus of production.</p> <p>It is possible that once the strongest capitalistic groups gain direct control of the state, the labor bureaucracy will be abolished as well as the governmental one, and be replaced by more dependable commissioners of big business. Although this could be achieved without a formal change of constitutional principles, it would mean a development similar to that in Germany. It is also possible that labor in its actual structure will acquire an even stronger portion of the set-up to come. In both cases the material condition of labor may temporarily improve in the ruler states of the future at the expense of the vanquished as well as the vassal nations but at the same time the gap between the significance of a single member and of the prominent functionaries will deepen, the impotence of the human individual will become more marked, and the differences in wage according to sex, age, industrial and race groups will increase. This will bring about the triumph of particularistic rationality within the workers and their complete disillusionment. They will fit even more completely into the system and, at the same time, become more obstinate against its exacting requirements. Concomitant with all the labor saving devices, which the workers expertly enjoy, is an ever-increasing personal discontent and an economical attitude towards any expenditure of labor power. No one wants to be a sucker. True, the technological process has not made the workers revolutionary but refractory, insubordinate, difficult to handle. While formerly the ruling class could use sweeping ideologies which were good enough for the whole population, monopolism has had to develop quite a science of Personnel Management. Big plants today keep specialists who cater to the personal problems of the single worker. They adapt the smartest techniques, such as resort places, abridged psycho-analysis, and Tschaikowskij symphonies over loudspeakers during working hours. All this accompanies an unabated terror against anyone who seriously opposes the system as such. Workers become a more and more disquieting factor within the whole setup of Monopolism by their very assimilation to its material and cultural patterns. They threaten to gain what this period destroys, namely, in individuality. Therefore capitalism itself tends to promote pseudo-collectivistic social patterns and fascist forms of government.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p> <p>Gradual abolishment of the market as a regulator of production is a symptom of the vanishing influence of anything outside the decisive groups.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> True, the needs which, in the market system, made themselves felt in a most distorted anonymous and irrational form, can now be determined by statistics and be satisfied or rejected in accordance with the policy of the rulers. But if this new rationality is in one way closer to the idea of reason than the market system, it is in another way farther from it. Dealings between the ruling and the ruled were really determined not by the market but by the unequal distribution of power as it was expressed in the property of the means of production; yet the transformation of human relations into objective economic mechanisms granted the individual, at least in principle, a certain independence; domination was humanized by dehumanized, that is to say, intermediary, spheres. Today the expression of human needs is distorted no longer by the dubious economic indicators of the market, but by their conscious molding in a giant system of socio-psychological surgery. The misery of unsuccessful competitors and of backward groups can no longer be ascribed to anonymous processes which permitted a distinction between them as economic subjects and as human beings. The downfall of vanquished opponents, competitors as well as whole social strata, minorities and nations, is decided upon by the elites. Those who are to suffer are singled out and called by their names. However, the insidious policies of economic leaders today are as private and particularistic, and therefore perhaps even blinder with regard to the real needs of society, than the automatic trends which once determined the market. It is still irrationality which shapes the fate of humans. This does not mean that reason is not maintained by any individuals or groups at all. There are more people today who have real insight into the economic situation and its potentialities than at any other period. Their chances seem to have improved by the progress of methods of production, communication, and planning, and by the decomposition of all kinds of superstitions. Actually, the positions of thought have deteriorated by the perfection of the methods of domination, by the extinction of theoretical thought and by the new and stronger taboos resulting from the pseudo enlightened philosophy of [pragmatism, which expresses the abandoning of unintegrated thought.]<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p> <p>Under monopolism and totalitarianism the perennial nature of domination, its parasitic character, becomes blatant. Each ruling class has always been monopolistic in so far as it has fenced itself off from the overwhelming majority of individuals. The structure has been that of competing rackets. Even the socially expedient functions which the ruling classes have fulfilled, have been turned into weapons against the underlying population and against the competing groups of their own class. The racket-pattern which has been typical of the behavior of the rulers toward the ruled is now representative of all human relations, even those within Labor.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p> <p>The similarity of the most respectable historical entities as, for instance, the hierarchies of the Middle Ages, to modern rackets, is obvious. The concept of racket therefore refers to the big as well as to the small units; they all struggle for as great a share as possible of the surplus value. In this respect the highest capitalistic bodies resemble the little pressure groups working within or without the pale of the law among the most miserable strata of the population. Emphasis is to be laid on the fact that the role of a group in production though determining to a great extent its share of consumption, has been in class society a good strategic position for grasping as much goods and services as possible in the sphere of distribution. This is particularly the case in periods when the mode of production to which its leaders stick so tenaciously has become obsolete. They make use of their productive apparatus as robbers make use of their guns. What the petty illegal racket has been to the particular branch of business which it “protected” and fleeced, the class, which constitutes the total of its under-rackets, has been so society as a whole. In the contemporary slang-use of rackets as an equivalent for any profitable job there may be no conscious thought of these implications. But objectively, such use of the term expresses the idea that in present-day society every activity, whatever it may be, has as its content and goal no interest other than the acquisition of as large a part as possible of the circulating surplus value. The attempt to monopolize an economic function, is for the sake neither of production nor satisfaction of needs. The label of “unproductivity” used against all sorts of activities and even against whole groups belies the constant fear that anything one does may be useless, seems to originate in an unconscious fear that all the hectic activity in this pragmatic society is labor of Sisyphus. Industry overcomes its own awareness and society’s realization that production is a mere stronghold in the fight for prey by adopting production as a kind of religious creed, by promoting technocratic ideas and attaching the “unproductive” label to other groups, which do not even have an access to the big industrial bastions. It is a mechanism similar to the one which produced the terroristic rackets in 16th and 17th century Europe, which killed hundreds of thousands of unfortunates and wiped out the female population of whole counties for their alleged intercourse with Satan. These torturing, murderous, predatory rackets exalted all the more fervently the tortured, murdered, robbed God on the cross, and adored all the more devoutly the Virgin for her conception through the holy spirit. Today the rackets propagate productivity and common spirit, persecute as “racket” each person or group which refuses to join them, and as destructive, each undertaking which tries to put an end to destruction. Those who accomplish repression by an ocean of spoken and written words watch jealously, lest a single “unrelated” sentence be heard.</p> <p>A true sociology of the racket as the living [element]<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> of the ruling class in history could serve both a political and a scientific purpose. It could help clarify the goal of political practice: a society whose pattern is different from that of the racket, a racketless society. It could serve to define the idea of Democracy which still leads an underground existence in the minds of individuals. Today rackets have adapted this idea to their economic and political practices. They have slyly formalized political concepts and thus made expert political cliques dominating whole groups and states into champions of Democracy. Conversely they brand humanist theoreticians as advocates of dictatorship, for they have tried to promote and practice, no matter how inadequately, democratic contents. Despite all this, the meaning of Democracy, deeply connected with that of truth, is not forgotten. It needs to be expressed against a world which is more repressive and hostile than ever and against the shrewdest tactics of stupidity. Scientifically the sociology of the racket could yield a more adequate philosophy of history. Moreover, it could help throw more light upon many issues in the realm of humanities, even upon such remote and controversial problems as the initiation rites and patriarchal rackets of magicians in primitive tribes. It would show that the “breaking” of young men at the occasion of their entrance into such tribes represented acceptance, not as much into the community as such as into a particularistic social totality. Very similar observations can be made with regard to the relation of adults and children through the Middle Ages up to the beginnings of the 19th century. Adults, with regard to the children, behaved as a totality. The racket was also the pattern of the organization of males with regard to females. The modern concept serves to describe past social relations. “The anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the monkey.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <p><br/></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>(Editor’s note:) Replaced by “materialist theory of history” in (1a) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>(Editor’s note:) Horkheimer’s substitution in (1a): “Marx has pointed out both the positive and the negative aspects of competition, (…)” <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>(Editor’s note:) (1a): “accuse” (handwritten insertion) <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>(Horkheimer’s footnote:) The term “totality” in the above sense of an organized structure will be so employed throughout this discussion. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:5"> <p>(Editor’s note:) From version in (1c), crossed out in (1b) and (1a).

The concept of class in its universal aspect, as typical for social theory, played an essential role in American sociology when it was young. Later on, emphasis was laid upon investigations in the light of which such concepts appear increasingly metaphysical. In our opinion the basis of this development is to be sought rather in the social process, to which we refer, than in the process of science itself. The time when sociology believed in its “larger task of constructing theoretical systems of social structure and social change,” the period before the first world war, was marked “by the general belief that theoretical sociology would somehow play a major constructive role in the progressive development of our society; sociology had the grandiose ambitions of youth.” (Charles H. Page, <em>Class and American Sociology</em>, New York 1940, p. 249). By this time its ambitions are certainly different.

The various laws resulting in the abolition of this right ratified the verdict against the existence of the independent economic subject. They put the dot on the ‘i’ of all trends and which abolished the liberal world. Gold in private possession for the owner provided a certain protection against the vacillations of the economy. Even modest property, guaranteed within certain limits, a life which was not entirely absorbed by participation in the economic process. The relative stability of the value of that particular merchandise endowed its owner with a force of resistance against his complete integration into the social mechanism, this resistance expressed itself in a certain degree of autonomy by which bourgeois culture was characterized. The more or less independent position of money for gold showed in his own mentality as well as in his literature and art. Culture obeyed its own laws to a certain extent and contained a criticism not only with regard to specific and concrete points of reality but also of its basic structure. Gold within the reach of any economic subject made the bourgeois individual somehow the successor of the aristocrat. The bourgeois could provide security for himself and make reasonably sure that even after his death his dependents would not have to submit totally to society. This freedom on the one hand excluded the masses, but, on the other hand, created cultural forms opposing this same exclusiveness. Today, no one can expect to find a place to lead a life of his own. He has to surrender completely: not to human solidarity but to the social process of monopoly. There are no safety-zones on the thoroughfare of society. Everyone must keep moving. Monopolism does not tolerate the beggar. But the beggar, whom the <em>Rentier</em> had always wanted to see removed from the streets, takes him along to the realm of the anguished. [*] Exemption from work, “privacy” voluntary or involuntary, bore witness to the existence of a non-totalitarian order. Gold in private possession was the sign of bourgeois rule. Its transfer to the state is the sign of monopoly.

What was already clear to everyone except for the professors in the times of so-called liberalism—namely, that the words ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ concealed the true cause of economic processes—has now dawned on them as well, for a simple reason. Whereas in earlier times, those concepts directly stood in for wealth management, profiteering, and exploitation, today the state, with which its sponsors are not in complete agreement for the time being, is recognized as the mediator between these factors and fluctuations in supply and demand. Now, just as the government has been found behind the veil of economics [<em>ökonomischen</em> <em>Schleier</em>] instead of naked relations of exploitation, economists declare the laws of the market have been replaced by historical, political, and psychological laws instead. They’ve taken this into account in actuality as well. The progressives and reformists among them move on to the late-democratic administrations which, on the grounds of the incompatibility of capitalism and concrete democracy, are increasingly isolated, increasingly powerless bureaucracies and, ultimately, replaced by ruling agencies [<em>Herrschaftsinstanzen</em>] more adequate to monopoly. The more fortunate majority of economic experts, even when they collaborate with wartime administrations, hold themselves back in reserve until the bright capitalist sun breaks through the clouds once more.</p> <p>However, the concept of economy they have declared obsolete is now more real than ever before. They were already disavowing it when there were still openings for professorships in economic theory. Only, in those days it was not done by liquidation of the word itself, but by its false substitution with so-called ‘national economy.’ Instead of getting to the bottom of the mode by which society produces and reproduces its material life, they investigated price-formation, economic cycles, and fluctuations of the stock market in a vacuum. Even then, out of embarrassment, they dismissed any considerations of the data which might bring out the connection between the transactions of the entrepreneur to actual power-relations as ‘extra-economic’; now, all of a sudden, the ultimate cause [<em>die Endursache</em>] is supposed to be the real confrontation between state power and national and international factors. But just as ‘national economy’ once veiled economic reality by hypostasizing market processes, now the increase of concentration on politics—or, at best, on technologie—effectively prevents cognition of the facts of the matter. This is the regression of bourgeois theory to its early stages, to Cardano and Machiavelli. The regression, however, is not the repetition but the distortion of the original state of affairs. [The rediscovery of politics, which in the Renaissance was a theoretical advance, has become in thinking under monopoly a category more ideological than the laws of the market were under liberalism: with its help, the surface is hypostasized. The dominated masses attribute world events to politics—hearing only appeal and degree, keeping themselves informed about the lives of the high and mighty, facts which need no theory. The masses experience the immediate consequences of political acts, of negotiations of rackets; they feel the effects of the emergency assistance, the inflation, the new job, the war and take big politics for fate and nature just as they once did the economic depression. And each of the protagonists shares in this belief: they know they hold a key position. Just as the entrepreneur confused his business ventures undertaken on the basis of economic cycles, his calculations and his speculations, with freedom, the presidents of trade unions and governments mistake their decisions for initiation of causal chains.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Governing, however, must defer to the same necessities as asset management: to the requirements of the reproduction of society in the form of power relations as they are. In this, there is little difference between the two periods. The unsurveyability of the market from which the self-deception of freedom arose had only expressed the fact that the relationships between entrepreneurs amongst themselves were not rational, but relationships of individual self-assertion. Today the struggles take place in much stronger groups, amongst the movements of the most concentrated masses of capital. The governments are executive apparatuses which cannot rationally penetrate the current balance of forces on which they depend, but feel their effects concretely.] They would be free, if…<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p> <h2 id="rackets-and-spirit-194244">Rackets and Spirit (1942/44)</h2> <p>The basic form of domination is the racket.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> It is possible, as some have assumed, that a single tyrant directed and protected the whole of the primal horde, but even in this case the gradation of strength between him and the weakest member of the horde establishes a hierarchy.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The next-strongest of the men guard their privileges over their lessers just as the patriarch guards his own over them. With the invention of tools, the order of rank is no longer determined by physical force alone, but just as much by the way of life prescribed to human beings by the nature of their tools. Better weapons, methods for cultivating the soil, in combination with a more suitable condition of the land, make a more abundant existence possible. Once a new stage is reached, regression into an earlier one is prevented not merely by new habits and needs in general, but also by the splitting of interests established on the basis of new methods. Unique requirements and the skills which correspond to them are formed and developed by certain individuals and groups, in opposition to the rest of society according to the positions they hold in the new division of labor. Through these abilities, the occupation of key positions in the social apparatus, the hierarchy of power, originally and exclusively grounded on natural potencies, undergoes modification until, in the course of social development, hierarchy ultimately corresponds to second, social nature—no longer to strength, but position. That first nature upon which society is grounded still is mutilated and enslaved.</p> <p>The divorce of above from below, dominators from dominated, rests on the organization of each individual power-group in itself and its opposition to those below it. Towards the top, each group is relatively amorphous, since, in the long run, their form of organization is molded by the strenuous effort not to slide towards the bottom. Organizations with the tips of their spears pointed upwards have no place in the established hierarchy, are without regular economic function, and, after periods of illegality, are brought back to life in revolutionary actions. In history thus far, whenever such undertakings were victorious, groups of functionaries and their clients replaced them in the modified hierarchy and hardened themselves downwards. These groups maintain their social function or adopt a new one, which, from then on, they monopolize. ‘Hardening’ means monopolizing the advantages which can be extorted on the grounds of a determinate, regular performance within the social process. One such hardening of a function—which would prove decisive—was private ownership of the means of production, namely the command over commodity-production in the age of industrialization.</p> <p>The most general category of group-executed functions is that of protection. Groups maintain the conditions for the continuation of the division of labor in which they have preferential standing, upholding their monopoly and warding off the changes which might endanger it. They are rackets. In each case, ‘ruling class’ means the structure of rackets on the grounds of a determinate mode of production, so far as they simultaneously protect and suppress the undermost strata. They may also be split amongst themselves according to the economic dynamics that shape their material interests; indeed, they may, consciously or unconsciously, perpetuate and even intensify the splitting so far as their protective functions are strengthened in the process. The relation of the ruling class to the unification of domination has always been a complicated one. The ambivalent relationship between the powers of empire and papacy in the joint suppression of centrifugal forces through the middle ages was more advantageous for each than the fusion of the two powers would have been. Even the maintenance of the nation-states only served a part of the special interests of the national bureaucracy, but to the benefit of the system of rackets as a whole.</p> <p>The downwards-hardening of rackets is identical with the hardening of the individuals who constitute them, something which has been consciously pursued throughout the whole of history. For the sake of one’s own children, this is what their education consisted of. Only in the liberalistic periods, in which a certain sector of rackets couldn’t be totally devoid of more obliging qualities for economic reasons, did [education] take on humane features. Prior to this, [education] was as cruel as the initiation-rites of the primitive tribe, which was already a racket itself. For individuals who lacked a rightful claim on the grounds of their descent to be integrated into a racket, the procedure was not like the incorporation of the youth into their own tribe, but rather like their consecration into the elect racket of the sorcerers. This demands the complete breaking of one’s personality, absolutely binding guarantees of one’s future faithfulness. The individual must relinquish all power, burn all of their bridges behind them. The true Leviathan, the racket demands the unqualified acceptance of the social contract. A continuum of smooth transitions runs from the sacrifice one’s own mother, which the would-be mage must make as an offering to the racket of sorcerers, to the dissertations of the universities, through which the adept must prove their thinking, feeling, and speaking have irrevocably taken on the forms of the racket of the academy. In certain situations, the outsider’s capacity for achievement may make them an attractive prospect for the racket, but it never entitles them to being incorporated into it. Official legal titles [<em>Rechtstitel</em>] merely attest to membership in a racket; thereby, the state, signing on behalf of all, certifies that the holder belongs to a racket and is thus integrated into the system. Legal titles and illegal titles, membership to the world and membership to the underworld, are distinguished by the fact that the world has at its disposal an all-embracing organization, a protection none shall escape; whoever is proscribed by its agencies is truly forsaken. Even during open conflicts between their umbrella organizations, one regards the individual with whom the other side had all-too serious difficulties with serious suspicion. It cannot be in any doubt that their defection from the one camp to the other is motivated by circumstances extraneous to their essential relation with it, not by their lack of adaptability to it. The Volscians welcomed the fugitive Coriolanus, whose affinity for domination shone far and wide, with open arms. After all, he was a man of the rackets of the gentiles and possessed the qualities of a field general, which are always a recommendation. The fugitive slave, however, is the symbol of the opposite.</p> <p>When an organization is so powerful that it can enforce its will upon a geographical area as permanent rule over the conduct of all its inhabitants, the domination of persons takes the form of laws [<em>Gesetze</em>]. This fixes relative power-relations. As a fixed medium, law [<em>Recht</em>], like other mediations, acquires a nature and force of resistance all its own. In becoming a substantial element of spirit, it incorporates the harmony of universality and particularity as a necessary idea. The sense and purpose of the law [<em>Recht</em>], to serve as the guideline for social life, is conditional upon its disregard for the determinate person and for their past, its validity for and against each and all under its remit until it is openly repealed. The means of domination oppose it as the reflection by which it unmasks itself. Increasingly closed off to those below, with the consolidation of monopoly, the totalitarian shape of society wages war against the law [<em>Recht</em>], against all mediations which have acquired a life of their own and existence in the forms of language. The fundamental illegality of the racket stands opposed to the spirit, even where the racket is not only legal, but stands behind the laws themselves. For as long as legality has existed, it has borne the features of illegality. The racket knows no mercy to life outside itself, but only the law of self-preservation. Under monopoly, language petrifies into a system of signs, more mute and expressionless than morse-code and the tapping-systems of prisoners. Language loses its sense of expression completely. It becomes a mechanism in production, like levers or wires, machinery for the calculations of administration, the embodiment of techniques of suggestion. The spiritual intercourse of individuals is reduced to the display and detection of identification tags. Speech either proves the speaker dependable enough for the rackets or betrays them as the conspirator who flashes the tip of their dagger. Petrified language points in accusation towards heaven like bare tree stumps on abandoned battlefields: it denounces the world of rackets it must yet serve. The mother-bomb launched from its airplane discharges twenty smaller bombs, tearing the fruit of mothers to shreds not once but twenty times over, stands accused for its hellish vocation precisely by the name ‘mother’ under which it has been advertised. The dead woods of words of our era will still bear witness against it after it has passed.</p> <p>Every racket conspires against the spirit; all conspire against and among one another. The reconciliation of universal and particular is immanent to the spirit; the racket is their irreconcilable opposition, though concealed behind ideas of unity and community. The evil is not domination in itself, but the final hardening of domination that defines the racket. From the whispering of the council of the elders in the primitive tribe to the understanding reached between industry and army in private clubs and boardrooms, domination provides the historical documentation of its bad consciences. The brutality of the underclasses, from which the secret of the ruling must be kept, is nothing original, but socially generated. The terrible, bloodthirsty ‘Collective’ that traverses the history of humanity is but the other face of the exclusionary rackets, consciously or unconsciously generated by them. The worn-out costumes of the aristocrats live on as ethnic dress [<em>Volkstrachten</em>], the rackets of the ruling class as the brutality of the stronger towards the weaker, as the indescribable viciousness of the mob towards the powerless. This is the racket of the little man, degenerated cultural heritage. The rackets have always pointed to the fearsomeness of the collectives they generate and direct as the ground of their own necessity, and the unholy naivete of the historian has accordingly mistaken the disfigured grimace of the masses for bare nature. To date, the racket has impressed its stamp on all social appearances; it has ruled as racket of the clergy, the court, the propertied, the race, the men, the adults, the family, the police, the criminal—and within these media themselves, in the form of individual rackets over the rest of their sphere. Everywhere it has set up the opposition between inner and outer; the man who belonged to no racket was outside in a radical sense—he was forsaken. Even in the heads of the isolated [<em>Vereinzelten</em>], rackets still ruled by means of their concepts and the schemata of judgment, the mode and content of thinking stemming from their world. To break through the boundary between inside and outside is the goal of politics, which, if fulfilled, would transform the world. In the true idea of democracy—which even now leads a repressed, subterranean existence among the masses—an intimation of a society free of the racket has never completely died out. To unfold this idea would mean breaking through the ticket of suggestion which still presses the true critique of the racket into its service [… and even now prepares to spread the fascist dictatorship of the industrial monopolies across the surface of the earth under the guise of an attack on the weakened rackets of finance capital.]<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p> <h2 id="history-of-the-american-labor-force-194244">History of the American Labor Force (1942/44)</h2> <p>The historical course of the proletariat led to a crossroads: it could become a class or a racket.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Racket meant privileges within national borders, class meant world revolution.

Judiciary [<em>Justiz</em>] is an early state monopoly, administered by the authoritative rackets. The separation of powers—of the making, applying, and executing of laws [<em>Gesetze</em>]—then arose as a protective measure for the citizens [<em>Bürger</em>] against the executive. They wanted to get the bureaucracy under control, to limit its arbitrariness, according to their interests. With the concentration of their class today, the need for the division of powers disappears; new rackets unite the powers in their hands, and the idea of universality wanes with the waxing of corruption of parliaments.</p> <p>Since the replacement of revenge by the state—which constitutes the state as its ground, whether it arises through internal development or conquest—there have been many theories of punishment as far as the citizens of the state [<em>Staatsbürger</em>] were concerned; to the slaves and serfs, it was an admitted means of terror. Punishment is rationalized as retribution, restoration, deterrence, protection, and education. Without punishment, society cannot exist, and this sign of its weakness is simultaneously its mark of shame, branding it as the very nature above which it seeks to rise.</p> <p>All of their theories dissolve—that is, in execution. However reasonable their ground for inflicting pain may be, the pain is senseless. Contra medicine, the purpose of punishment is pain. Pain is not the undesired but desired effect of each and every punitive measure. The achievement of its moral purpose, with which it may excuse itself, is questionable and immoral. The power that methodically turns pain against the powerless turns it into means of its own dark ends, hidden behind morality. The enemy is never the object of punishment, for it is always administered to the defenseless. Clearer than through any other institution, it is through punishment society shows it represents not universality but particularity, even if it were that of the majority, excepting only the one who is punished. Every human being could attain universality through insight; there would be no need for pain. Recourse to pain is the confession of the illegality of law [<em>der Illegalität des Rechts</em>].</p> <p>In class society, the particularity is quite pronounced. The laws [<em>Gesetze</em>] are set in pre-established harmony with the rule of cliques which hold weapons and means of production. Religion, especially protestantism, has taken it upon itself to support such domination through the emphasis on evil, through which it glorifies punishment. Before power, this anthropology points upwards with one finger and respectfully bows; before powerlessness, it justifies punishment as divine institution, like poverty and war. But even the overwhelming majority which must resort to punishment is still the false; whoever transfigures it commits idolatry, as did Luther, conscripting spirit in the service of domination to which the flesh is fettered out of fear and need. To the reality of misery, he added the lie that the states and rulers whose ravage fills history, whose ravage is history itself, has a sacred significance. Such a lie was unthinkable before the concept of spirit, which first entered into the world through Christianity and would surely transform it in turn. Such a lie pollutes the Christian centuries.</p> <h2 id="solidarity-19421944">Solidarity (1942/1944)</h2> <p>Solidarity is grounded on shared knowledge.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Due to the necessary inconclusivity of knowing, it seems solidarity is necessarily fleeting. The insights which once bound human beings to one another might prove incorrect. The ruptures in French schools of poetry and painting through the last century, the sworn enmity of friends over a principle, the factional splits between the smallest groups and groupuscules of the extreme left—in any event, these schisms do them more honor than the prudent coherence does psychoanalytic and political gangs.</p> <p>On closer inspection, however, there are motives beyond the theoretical one at the root of those eternal feuds of the old <em>Bohème</em>. In negation of an earlier state of knowledge, it is not crossed out but overcome by determinate negation. The transition is demanded by the thing itself [<em>die Sache selbst</em>], it is inherent within it. The slackening of intellectual forces may keep the individual from carrying this out on their own. However, once this step has been taken by anyone, only the pettiest individual [<em>individuelle</em>] interests can determine the individual [<em>Einzelnen</em>] to defend the duller, more limited mode of thinking against the more precise, richer one. This is neither blind adherence nor mere fidelity, for the more primitive consciousness is always better off when taken up by a more differentiated consciousness than it is by itself. There are mechanical obstacles which stand like walls between the subject and historically adequate knowledge, such that the subject cannot perceive it, even if it exists. But this is why the old and the new are not of equal cognitive standing.</p> <p>According to Marx’s insight, proletarian class interest should not simply oppose the bourgeois, but objectively be the higher. The power of the insight [<em>Einsichtigkeit</em>] into this objectivity facilitated the defection of the sons of the bourgeoisie over to the side of the struggling workers. The reverse path, from the proletarian to the bourgeoise, was betrayal—betrayal of truth, as much as it was for the remaining bourgeoisie to remain in an ideology which had long since become transparent as such. They were not cut off from knowledge by social fact, but by the obstinate narrowing of their own horizons for private advantage. For so long they were resolved to disclaim, to turn away from what they hypocritically cried out were the highest of values—religion and truth, love of humanity and justice—until they had become too stupid for private advantage itself and are now, for all their pedantic cleverness, rightly reduced to nothing.</p> <p>Considerations for career tempered the disputes of the <em>Bohème</em>. Whatever in solidarity is threatened by the process of knowing is that which is still impure and bad in it. Not a few communities have fallen apart without solidarity being extinguished. Every once in a while, it was picked up by a single one abandoned by all.</p> <h2 id="a-theory-of-the-criminal-19431944">A Theory of the Criminal (1943/1944)</h2> <p>The more fragmented it was, the more mediated domination was.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Individual property owners did not keep the poor down as the feudal lord and the oriental despot had with satraps and personal guards, the simple continuation of barbaric-physical violence; their will had to be objectified in law, and so limit the totality of the power it represents. Law [<em>Gesetz</em>] as means of domination develops a logic of its own, an opposition to domination which cannot be overcome by sending out silk thread. Whoever offends in bourgeois society is no longer taboo like the transgressor of primitive solidarity, no longer the rebellious slave or serf. The offender does not merely stand outside their society, but is rather the exponent of a conflict which resides within that society itself. The social principle to which the law owes its existence is reproduced in the criminal. Even through the religious hymn to the worldly sword of the executioner [<em>Richtschwert</em>] of which Protestantism sang, the human-inhuman origin of law [<em>Recht</em>] shines through, the will of the minority giving itself the form of the majority. The many lords who, though in competition with one another, sought to control the authorities, had to grant a kind of autonomy not only for their own economic command but also to the protection against the competing, executive organs of terror, so they took up the law. Criminal law protects the citizen not only from the crime, but also from the state supposed to avenge it. The perpetrator, the outsider, is still thought of as an individual. Bourgeois criminal law goes back to the civil law of the primitives rather than the measures against the transgressors, so far as one can speak of such a law at all. Positive law, “governing all the phases of tribal life,” says Malinowski, “consists… of a body of binding obligations, regarded as a right by one party and acknowledged as a duty by the other, kept in force by a specific mechanism of reciprocity and publicity inherent in the structure of their society. … Their stringency is ensured through the rational appreciation of cause and effect by the natives, combined with a number of social and personal sentiments… .”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> The formulation of principles and laws belongs to exchange. It is connected with the consolidation of private property,<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> which, ultimately, makes human beings into subjects. The market comes by its opposite honestly; the market, like money, demands the law. There is an affinity between the two media of the economy [viz., law and money]. They are universal in form: one cannot tell from the law itself where it will have effect, nor from money where it comes—although in actuality, one is drawn to the poor, the other to the rich. Precisely the neutrality of the media, their formal universality, determines the member of the bourgeois world as subject, which is the same in all. These [media] first create the concept of the human being. Personality has at least rudimentary legal relations [<em>Rechtsverhältnisse</em>], a universal for its presupposition. The criminal counts on such universality. So far as his <em>ratio</em> extends, he grabs hold of the chances that flow his way from the anonymity of the means which make him equal as well. The accursed, godforsaken, the poor sinner, affront to gods and men, is the violator of the articles of the law; the criminal, a product of humanity.</p> <p>The deception—as if among the bourgeois there were criminals other than the perpetrators of crimes against property—is ideology in the truest sense: illusory semblance to which individuals are necessarily subject given their role in the social process. Murder is certainly no longer punished less than theft, as in periods of scarcity of goods and labor. Since the Lord said <em>vengeance is mine</em>, the state has monopolized the system of vengeance, to which the individual is held to account whether they commit sacrilege, sexual murder, embezzlement, or theft. The business of the state requires uniform guidelines. Even juridical concepts are subject to leveling. Their opposition to one another is erased as every violation is measured by the same measure according to a common denominator of punishment. This reduction was accomplished according to the schema of property. The category of the commodity has taken hold of all branches of human intercourse to the effect that even life and limb are understood, attacked, or kept under guard according to the model of property. Everything within reach of human beings becomes something at someone’s disposal, an object of the legal subject [<em>Gegenstand</em> <em>des Rechtssubjekts</em>]. The law [<em>das</em> <em>Recht</em>] was even involved in the constitution of the body itself. Just as each logical classification points back to painful separations in actuality, so too do the parts of the body point back to the oldest proprietary rights [<em>Rechtsschutz</em>]. Any injury to the Lord and to his ‘hands’ [<em>Gesindes</em>]<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> had a price corresponding to the impairment [<em>Beeinträchtigung</em>] resulting from the loss. The hand was dearer than the ear. The parts of the body [<em>Körperteile</em>] belong to the body, and the body belongs to the person. The state protected its ‘member’<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> as the owner of his body [<em>Leibes</em>], and under such protection [<em>Schutz</em>] the individual formed as the embodiment of the psychological. Proprietary right over the body is a special case of the protection of private property. The bloom of criminal law coincides with those times in which the central state identified its internal peace with the security of property.</p> <p>In the concept of the criminal, bourgeois society reassures itself that it knows how to unify universal and particular interest, for only so far as it guarantees self-preservation to each can it condemn by [its] reason what it prosecutes by [its] particularism. The theoretical concept of the crime cannot be separated from the construction of the state contract by which it obliges people into obedience to the state, given that they, for the sake of their own well-being, transferred the highest of powers over to it. “But by safety must be understood,” Hobbes writes, “not the sole preservation of life in what condition soever, but in order to its happiness. For to this end did men freely assemble themselves, and institute a government, that they might, as much as their human condition would afford, live delightfully.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Once the state contract is in effect, the criminal is in breach of his own pragmatic reason which confronts him as objective in the state. This defines the criminal in distinction from the evildoer. For bourgeois thinking, there is no sin but that against the principle of the self. The criminal violates consistent, organized self-preservation for the sake of the limited, anarchic. His prudence [<em>Klugheit</em>] comes up short. He is incapable of waiting. He is all-calculating yet wants for calculating intelligence. He is punished for his folly. Any other theory of punishment betrays society’s doubts about its own rationality. The concepts of state contract and reason are equivalent for the bourgeoisie. Society regards itself as concrete reason, the union of the rational who would protect themselves from nature in common. Towards those who do not pay for their incorporation with strict obedience, society itself administers the destructive force of nature, the very same from which society had provided them escape; society becomes a premeditated, systematic force of nature in comparison to which the unmediated force of nature, for all its cruelty, still appears the truer state of innocence.</p> <p>The stigma of the criminal is uselessness. He skips over the stage of production and seeks to appropriate as much circulating surplus value as possible for himself. The industrialist, businessman, advertising agent, professor stick to circulation as well, but in the fulfillment of their contract. The criminal, however, represents on the inside what the war presents to the outside: the capture of surplus value under the elimination of exchange. Robber barons, condottiere, volunteer corps [<em>Freischärler</em>], racketeers vacillate between warrior and criminal. Whichever pole they are assigned is not up to them, but to the given state of domestic and foreign policy. Crime is the deed <em>par excellence</em>, appropriation without exchange. It forms the naive counterpart to the ownership of property [<em>Besitz</em>], which, much like itself, creates no goods, either as manual or intellectual labor, and yet exacts its tribute, whether squeezing it directly from the factory or indirectly through interests and dividends. This secret kinship with crime, the social affinity of the poles: the privileged and the condemned, provokes the proprietor to revenge. He has the entirety of the armed forces on his side; the criminal, at best, a machine gun. But property ownership, without which there would be no ego nor conscience, consciencelessly suffers not another blackmailer besides it. The life lived on one’s own terms without service to the system trespasses against the divine order of things. Criminals and capitalists are only out for profit; they are not interested in any work. The ‘joy of work’ is an ideology of large-scale industry in the period already in the process of the liquidation of the bankers and the sphere of circulation as a whole: a conceptual schema for the administration of human beings under monopoly. The capitalistic criminal wasn’t violent from the start. As a burgher, he preferred profit without bloodshed to military actions. He only resorted to war and state of siege when the existence of the class was thrown into question or there were surplus profits to be obtained. The career criminal feels much the same. “In the execution of the crime, a ‘good’ criminal avoids unnecessary cruelty and murder. The thing to aim at is ‘big money.’ The risk is equal whether you are stealing seven or seventy thousand dollars. ‘I don’t look to kill anybody. If I can prevent it, I will. But I would shoot somebody to get away, if there’s plenty of money there, say $100,000.’”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> The criminal represents the more irrational, more primitive racket in comparison to the state-protected class monopoly. His profession points back to early-bourgeois and pre-bourgeois forms of domination; these continue to thrive in the present as Mafia and Camorra, despised like overthrown deities become demonic powers for the new religion. Contemporary domination perpetuates itself in forms, however destructive to human beings they may ultimately prove, through which social life is reproduced at the same time. The criminal, on the other hand, too weak to punch above his weight with his contemporaries, apes domination which has already become obsolete. He has no part in the social reproduction of life to the end of its domination. To this extent, he is destructive.</p> <p>Where bourgeois society confronts nature directly, production and destruction coincide. In the slaughterhouse, murder [<em>Totschlag</em>] is at one with the production of the means of life. But in the relation of the classes to one another, the functions are differentiated: the entrepreneur has command over production, the policeman hunts down the criminal. Violence is no less essential to the bourgeoisie than to those forms of society in which the sword and the whip were still in the hands of the master or of those in his immediate vicinity. Wherever one clan [<em>Sippe</em>] or class would reserve the possibility of a relatively secure life for itself while leaving the other to hunger, insecurity, and labor, it needs to maintain its hold upon the force to strike as well, whether in the shape of a club to repel strangers from entering one’s cave or the nightstick to murder prisoners in the cellar of the police precinct. Due to the division of labor, this force crystallizes into apparatuses of oppression on the reverse side of culture. In the penal system and the police, every instinct of destruction finds somewhere to hide. By contrast, the destruction brought about by crime is not assigned to it by the division of labor. It is merely a deduction from production. Despite Mandeville’s illuminating suggestions concerning the productivity of destruction in general, and the dependency of arts and trades on crime in particular<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>—which Marx complements with his own satirical apology for crime, in its significance for technology, economy, and culture<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>—it remains a mere ferment of reversion and dissolution. At best, the criminal becomes an honest bandit who murders for a fixed sum. He remains at this stage just as quack doctors and faith healers still linger at that of the alchemist in the transition to natural science. The criminal will not surrender his freedom nor pocket his winnings without becoming a member of the enterprise he succumbs to. He cannot make himself into a subject, no matter how hard he tries. Black Will, the cutthroat in <em>Arden of Feversham</em>,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> long before <em>The Beggar’s Opera</em>,<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> already exhibits the ethos of the businessman [<em>Ethos des Kaufmanns</em>] who keeps the contract even when it proves unfavorable. “I have had ten pound to steal a dog, and we have no more here to kill a man; but that a bargain is a bargain, … .”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> His ideal is that of security for the branch of industry in which he is employed. “Ah, that I might be set a work thus through the year, and that murder would grow to an occupation, that a man might follow without danger of the law: – zounds, I warrant I should be warden of the company!”<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Will is a thwarted entrepreneur. But private murder was a poor line of work anyway; it was only the object of regular commerce as long as commerce itself was half-taboo. With the police, it is another matter entirely: henchmen and hangmen who share in the crookedness of the criminal and the brutality of his profession, but not in his autonomy. Though their licensed violence functions for the sake of money as well, they are not paid for services rendered, nor in spoils like Black will, but receive a wage. The policeman, the state prosecutor, and the judge bear no responsibility for the existence and content of their profession; they are essentially instruments, and only have power as such. They thus consider themselves to be of a third degree because they publicly accept wages for the first. If the criminal is the crippled, retarded twin brother of the bourgeois, the police agent is his authorized representative [<em>Prokurist</em>]. The principle in both is the same: violence, without which bourgeois property cannot exist.</p> <p>In the deed of the criminal, however, the reversion into earlier stages of development is united with the most extreme consequence of progress: it negates taboos. In planning and execution, the criminal only takes the power of the law [<em>Gesetz</em>] and its servants into consideration, but not [power, not] the thing itself [<em>die</em> <em>Sache</em>]. The overcoming of fear before this thing was the way of the bourgeois spirit from the very beginning. After the dissolution of nature in things, however, which brought the evildoers to a halt, there is no reserve for it in humanity either. Humanity establishes its dominion without restriction. The radicality of this is revealed in crime. When bourgeois thinking set out to emancipate itself from shrinking back in terror, it shied away from nothing as crime. The result is that thinking and doing, each driven to their extreme, collapse into one another: the doing merely uncovers the powerlessness of things already realized for thinking. The content, the spirit of the thing, which the crime ignores, is the secret which, according to the enlightenment, does not exist at all. Thus the worship of blind violence out of desperation for rescue from the cycle of transgression and revenge, in which crime is mythical, is one with progress itself. The abstract self of the enlightenment, which can convert nature into propaganda because it is no longer arrested by any content within it, and only ever knows its own purposes, is in the crime shot through with the senselessness of totally objectified nature. It is the deed that shrinks back from nothing and yet remains the very shrinking of the primitive into whose soul no glimmer of rescue from the darkness of the cycle breaks: this is the deed that lights the way forward for the bourgeoisie on its path towards dynamic society.</p> <h1 id="internal-memos">Internal Memos</h1> <h2 id="la-memo-1942">LA Memo (1942)</h2> <p><strong>Memorandum.

It is, however, not the underlying <em>thema probandum</em>. The emancipatory features of enlightenment and pragmatism should be worked out just as much as the repressive.

Weight should also be given to the influence of technical changes, to the transition from mediated to immediate domination.

The most recent publication of the CIO on “Industrial Democracy” (Reuttenberg and another author) seems to contradict the thesis of progressive divergence represented by Pollock and Neumann against Marcuse.</li> <li>How does academic and non-academic discussion today stand with respect to Marxian theory? It would be of the utmost importance to first conduct a survey of this discussion to subsequently work through in a critical manner. What is the position of trade union leadership towards Marxist and non-Marxist theory? Is there any serious effort being undertaken to develop Marxian economics further? What other important theorems should be seriously contemplated today?</li> <li>In relative separation from the above questions, there is the problem relating to the direct control of mass culture by monopoly. It would have the greatest significance for the project to have a clear notion of the mechanisms of control, economic and personal, through which each of the important spheres and the cultivation of the next generation are regulated. This is rather simple to establish in the case of film; the most important data is still to be compiled from other areas (radio, newspapers, magazines, universities, and scientific foundations). To this belongs the interconnections between individual sectors of the culture-industry. Perhaps Upton Sinclair, who studied a number of these questions at an earlier point in time, will be of use for these investigations. Furthermore, the literary-sociological side of the work, which has so far extended only to German and American biographies, ought to be expanded to other branches of popular literature and to the specific categories of such work as a whole.</li> </ol> <p>In the following, we provide several suggestions which should be pursued further in future correspondence. Further areas for literary analysis come to mind: best sellers and the publications of book clubs; movie-magazines, especially those which report on the stars and their private lives; introductions to the drugstore editions of major literary works; program booklets for philharmonic concerts and other kinds of entertainment; analysis of advertisements.</p> <p>Categories in connection with the big work:</p> <ul> <li>“Unmasking” but not attack</li> <li>Reduction of quality to quantity, malice towards different qualities</li> <li>Accept blows without rancor to eventually be included in racket</li> <li>Apology for the accidentality and irrationality of career (no development)</li> <li>Indifference to the area in which one finds success</li> <li>Glorification of determinate practical qualities, especially in the extra-practical domain (e.g. dexterity, quick-wittedness, aggressivity, technical specialist knowledge and tricks, “performance,” endurance, pseudo-radicalism)</li> <li>Antinomies: the hero must be individual and average at the same time.</li> <li>Conscious subordination of law [<em>Recht</em>] to the collectivity</li> <li>Success as justification.</li> </ul> <p>Naturally, many of these aspects are already included within the biographical work. Others which have already arisen have here been deliberately omitted. The end goal would be to develop them on the basis of a unified theoretical context—namely, the tendency towards the unification of the world.</p> <h2 id="notes-for-the-programme-of-the-book-8301942">Notes for the Programme of the Book (8/30/1942)</h2> <ul> <li>The part on the theory of immiseration [<em>Verelendungstheorie</em>] should be used to show that with the decrease in immiseration, with the integration of the workers into existing society, the class constitutes itself as the epitome of individual rackets, and accordingly cuts out everything which no longer belongs to the class in this sense.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> For the first time, this relation should be presented not as it always has been to date, by the enemies of the proletariat, but by a proletarian theory itself.</li> </ul> <p><ins> Problem:</ins></p> <ul> <li>Should there be a historical unity?

Crime, through its ever new methods of attack on property, constantly calls into being new methods of defence, and so is as productive as <em>strikes</em> for the invention of machines. … In his <em>Fable of the Bees</em> (<em>1705</em>) Mandeville had already shown that every possible kind of occupation is productive, and had given expression to the tendency of this whole line of argument: “That what we call Evil in this World, Moral as well as Natural, is the grand Principle that makes us Sociable Creatures, the solid Basis, the <em>Life and Support of all Trades and Employments</em> without exception; there we must look for the true origin of all Arts and Sciences; and the moment Evil ceases, the Society must be spoiled if not totally destroyed.” Only Mandeville was of course infinitely bolder and more honest than the philistine apologists of bourgeois society.” <em>Marx-Engels Collected Works</em>, Vol. 30: Marx 1861-63.

Unlike most animals, humans do not have immediate access to their own conditions of reproduction. The tools and knowledge necessary for their metabolic interchange with nature is mediated through social formations, even what constitutes human needs at any given historical period is socially mediated, unlike what modern psychology might want us to believe.<d-footnote>See Adorno’s critique of the false division of basic and non-basic needs in Theodor W Adorno, “Theses on Need,” trs. Martin Shuster and Iain Macdonald in *Adorno Studies*, Volume 1, Issue 1, January 2017, 103-105.</d-footnote> Horkheimer notes that the invention of tools marked the division between domination purely based on physical force and that based on social control.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist” [1942] in Max Horkheimer Gesammelte Schriften, Bd. 12, ed. Gunzelin Schmid Noerr (S. Fischer Verlag, 1985), 287</d-footnote> Human production (and reproduction) is mediated through tools that arise in specific social relations, the same tools in turn start to mediate the social relations, human organizations and ways of living come to be “prescribed by the nature of such tools.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Marx conceptualizes tools as <em>organs</em> of production, as a corporeal part of the human body required for human metabolism:</p> <p>The first thing of which the labourer possesses himself is not the subject of labour but its instrument. Thus Nature becomes one of the organs of his activity, one that he annexes to his own bodily organs, adding stature to himself in spite of the Bible.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1*, in *Marx/Engels Collected Works* (hereafter MECW), vol. 35 (Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1996), 189</d-footnote></p> <p>As Søren Mau has recently pointed out, as instruments of production (qua organs) can become the private property of individuals and groups, it “has the consequence that power can weave itself into the very fabric of the human metabolism.”<d-footnote>Søren Mau, *Mute Compulsion: A Marxist Theory of the Economic Power of Capital* (Verso, 2023), 115</d-footnote> The theoretical core of the concepts of the relations and forces of production consists in this fact, namely that human metabolism and reproduction is organized in definite social relations with the use of tools. Following Engels, Horkheimer argues that the primacy of tools in production is mirrored by the development of patriarchy apropos transition from mother-right to father-right with the concrete development of sedentary agriculture. The bygone age of matriarchy is associated with that of pre-history, an era without class conflict that did not objectify humans as tools for social reproduction;<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family” in *Critical theory: Selected Essays*, tr. Matthew J. O’Connell et al (Continuum, 1982), 118</d-footnote> Durkheim, meanwhile, associates pre-history without the division between public and private life as mechanical solidarity, contrasted with the organic solidarity of modernity with its highly specialized division of labour that grants its members some semblance of individuality.<d-footnote>Émile Durkheim, *The Division of Labour in Society*, trans. W. D. Halls, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013).</d-footnote> In actuality, this division between private and public signified the development of class society with domination within and outside the family by different groups of people organized in a hierarchy. The development of patriarchy and class are deeply intertwined.</p> <p>Early critical theory explicitly uses the dialectic between forces and relations of production as a starting point to develop a theory of class. The ownership of the means and objects of production by different members of the species was primarily maintained by repression of direct producers. The repression was rationalized as being in the long-term interests of the whole of society because it purportedly incentivized social and economic development; this development in turn made the forces of repression obsolete and irrational.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory” in *Can One Live After Auschwitz? A Philosophical Reader*, ed. Rolf Tiedemann (Stanford University Press, 2003), 110</d-footnote> The subordination of individuals in a hierarchy appears as rational until the conditions of social reproduction change through the development of society (apropos the forces of production.) As emblematically articulated by Max Weber, the concept of rationality in traditional theory meant the use of reason by a transcendental calculating subject to navigate the world of values.<d-footnote>See Weber’s discussion on formal rationality in Max Weber, Economy and Society: A New Translation, trans. Keith Tribe (Harvard University Press, 2019,) 172-177; Gillian Rose on Weber’s neo-kantian inheritance in Gillian Rose, Hegel Contra Sociology, (Verso, 2009,) 22-23; Horkheimer on the Marburg school and the status of the individual in Horkheimer, “Traditional and Critical Theory,” 198-200.</d-footnote> Horkheimer appropriates the concept of rationality as itself arising from historically developing social relations that organizes the conditions of social reproduction. It is not “false” consciousness to accept the conditions of subordination but rather it is in “the [immediate] interests of those who were ruled… It was a condition for the development of mankind’s capabilities.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 70</d-footnote> At stake is how humans navigate and internalize the limits of social formations as activity rather than as mere automatons fully path-dependent on a structure.</p> <p>Hence, the intersection of the process of production and the form of exploitation is central to understanding the class structure of any given social formation.<d-footnote>See “Introduction: Themes in Historical Materialism” in Jairus Banaji, *Theory as History: Essays on Modes of Production and Exploitation*, (Haymarket, 2010).</d-footnote> The processes through which the surplus labour of direct producers is appropriated by the owners of the means of production influences the forms of thinking (and social control) in society that become embodied in relatively autonomous institutions such as the family, education, and religion—the Institut für Sozialforschung prefigures what is later conceptualized as the ideological state apparatus that stabilizes the structure of capitalism by Louis Althusser.<d-footnote>See Louis Althusser, *On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses*, trans. G. M. Goshgarian (London New York: Verso, 2014).</d-footnote> As Horkheimer himself puts it:</p> <p>“To regard the economic process as a determining ground of events means that one considers all other spheres of social life in their changing relationships to it and that one conceives this process itself not in its isolated mechanical form but in connection with the specific capabilities and dispositions of men, which have, of course, been developed by the economic process itself.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 52</d-footnote></p> <p>On the flipside, Horkheimer interrogates the processes of internalization and rationalization of authority by direct producers (and the excluded), which is characteristically reflected in the culture of a society. The “so-called social nature” of humanity that appears natural to positivist psychologists as the “self-integration into a given order of things”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 56</d-footnote> through institutions such as religion is reducible to “the memory of the acts of force by which men were made ‘sociable’ and civilized and which threaten them still if they become too forgetful.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 52</d-footnote> The history of direct domination and its social memory is reflected in the tendency to accept conditions of indirect domination—the history of the caste system and its continuing prevalence today in both direct and indirect forms serves as the paradigmatic example. The liberal hope that the caste system would be eventually supplanted by the development of capitalism was never realized, caste domination was instead integrated with capitalist social relations.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 62-65.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="class-contract-and-monopoly">Class, Contract and Monopoly</h2> <p>Marx extensively wrote about class and class struggle throughout his life but never developed a systematic theory of class per se. Infamously, the manuscript for the third volume of C<em>apital</em> ends just as Marx begins a section on class. Furthermore, Michael Heinrich argues that the concept of class in the three volumes of <em>Capital</em> appears as the (unwritten) result of the unfolding categories of political economy rather than a precondition/assumption for a systematic theory of capitalism.<d-footnote>Michael Heinrich, *An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Karl Marx’s Capital*, tr. Alexander Locasio (Monthly Review Press, 2012), 192</d-footnote> Marx describes his method as “rising from the abstract to the concrete,”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, “Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58” in Karl Marx: 1857-61, Collected Works 28 (Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1986), 38 See section 3 of the Introduction in the volume for more on Marx’s method, 37–45..</d-footnote> developing the most abstract concepts of classical political economy that are layered on top of each other to describe complex tendencies that exist within capitalism as a historically emergent system. Marx starts with describing the dynamics of commodities as products of labour, from which he derives most other mutually interlocking concepts and categories of “exchange value and use value, exchange value and value, concrete and abstract labour, as well as the necessity of money and its functions, the concept of capital, the theory of surplus value and exploitation, the class relation underlying all of this, and so on.”<d-footnote>Mau, *Mute Compulsion*, 13</d-footnote> Thus, the concept of class in the capitalist mode of production is dependent on all these other interlocking concepts. This is quite different from modern sociological theories that abstractly conceptualize class in terms of social stratification based on occupation and their income brackets (i.e. lower, middle, and upper classes). Following Marx, Horkheimer conceptualizes class as a concrete historical category that cannot be understood in isolation/abstraction from the actual processes of social reproduction in a given social formation. Class is simultaneously understood at a structural level as the social position of a group within a specific social formation and as a group cognizant of itself as a class apropos its social location. Class as a political agent, or an interest group only exists if individuals that share common interests are conscious of their own social position.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> In “Reflections on Class Theory,” Adorno points out that “the concept of class is bound up with the emergence of the proletariat.”<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 93</d-footnote> Class only becomes intelligible with the universal domination over the proletariat through necessitating conditions that require an individual to sell her labour-power for wages, a situation which is the result of the ongoing process of primitive accumulation.<d-footnote>Most readings of Marx on primitive accumulation understand it as something restricted to the past. For Marx, however, primitive accumulation is a necessary component of capitalism as a system. Capitalism functions through the continual appropriation of resources that create conditions of wage labour. See William Clare Roberts, “What Was Primitive Accumulation? Reconstructing the Origin of a Critical Concept,” *European Journal of Political Theory* 19, no. 4 (October 2020): 532–52, [https://doi.org/10.1177/1474885117735961](https://doi.org/10.1177/1474885117735961)</d-footnote> The declaration that “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles”<d-footnote>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, “Manifesto of the Communist Party” in MECW*,* Vol. 6 (Lawrence and Wishart, 1976) 484</d-footnote> in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> implied that what was previously thought of as natural hierarchies of the primitive tribe or the divine right of kings were nothing but stronger groups dominating the weaker ones to control production and thereby exist outside the immediate process of production qua labour, i.e. to be served by majority of the population.<d-footnote>As Horkheimer puts it, “to assume authority over large areas in order to be nourished and housed and served by as large a population as possible. The same holds good for the ruling groups of Greek antiquity, as represented by the city-states and factions.” Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The past is understood retroactively through the present—or inversely, as Adorno puts it, the history of domination and oppression culminates in the universal domination of capitalism.<d-footnote>“If all the oppression that man has ever inflicted on man culminates in the modern age in the cold inhumanity of free wage labor, then the past is revealed in conditions and things – the romantic contrast to industrial reason – as the trace of former suffering. The archaic silence of pyramids and ruins becomes conscious of itself in materialist thought: it is the echo of factory noise in the landscape of the immutable.” Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 94</d-footnote> Hence, for Marx (and the critical theorists), class struggle implied the fight against the system of capitalism and the very concept of classes as such.</p> <p>The capitalist process of production is based on the “so-called labour contract,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, Authority and the Family, 86</d-footnote> where the worker could sell her labour-power for a wage through which she could access the conditions of her continual reproduction. The contract guaranteed by the state and law, which were (purportedly) and to varying degrees held up by democratic institutions that represented the will of the people within the nation-state. However, this free contract concealed the actual inequality between people, where an individual worker was more “dependent on the settlement of a contract” than the owners of Capital, who could choose between workers.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This meant that the working class had to adapt to existing unequal conditions by competition (contra struggle) amongst themselves as each individual worker had to compete against others to sell her labour, which meant that wages rarely rose above subsistence levels, and even below subsistence observed throughout the history of capitalism. Hence, “The distinction between employer and worker lay in the fact that this impersonal necessity […] represented for the employer the condition for his control and for the worker a pitiless fate.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> The subordination of the individual to irrational economic circumstances through the contract is also personal submission to the will of an employer.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>The Soviet jurist Evgeny Pashukanis locates the birth of legality and the institution of law with the development and universalization of capitalist social relations. In capitalism, the relationship of exploitation is legally mediated through the form of the contract as the worker disposes of her labour power as a commodity on the market, in contrast with direct forms of subjugation seen in societies based on slavery and serfdom. Social regulation, sanctions, and disciplinary mechanisms are rendered through the legal form rather than direct unalienated punishment.<d-footnote>Michel Foucault shows the transition between direct punishment to indirect punishment through the legal apparatus. Michel Foucault, *Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison,* tr. Alan Sheridan (Vintage Books, 1995)</d-footnote> Hence Pashukanis argues that it is only in capitalism that “the legal form attains universal significance, legal ideology becomes the ideology par excellence, and defending the class interest of the exploiters appears with ever increasing success as the defense of the abstract principle of legal subjectivity.”<d-footnote>Evgeny Bronislavovich Pashukanis, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism*, tr. Barbara Einhorn, ed. Chris Arthur (Transaction, 2002), 45</d-footnote> The primary function of the legal form is the concealment of the actuality of exploitation in the process of production, which is accompanied by the reduction of individuals (who embody differences) to a formal equality as subjects of the law. The legal form becomes the essential “precondition for the non-coercive extraction of surplus value, on which the reproduction of the capitalist relations of production rest.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> For Horkheimer, the ban on collective bargaining and the state control over contracts in fascism “revealed what was already inherent in liberalism.” Hence, “it would be a grave theoretical mistake to denounce the contract in modern totalitarianism as a mere formality, and stress its genuine authenticity under liberalism.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The very impersonal nature of the labour contract incentivizes reactionary responses by hiding the actual relations of exploitation between people, which in conditions of social crisis leads to minority groups being held as a scapegoat.<d-footnote>See Moishe Postone, “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism: Notes on the German Reaction to "Holocaust",” *New German Critique*, no. 19 (1980): 97–115, [https://doi.org/10.2307/487974](https://doi.org/10.2307/487974).</d-footnote></p> <p>The development of capitalism is highlighted by intra-class struggle within the ruling class as the logic of monopolization/expansion comes in conflict with each other, alongside the primary struggle between producers and owners of the means of production. The ruling class, “has always been characterized by its internal struggles, by the efforts of one of its parts to secure the spoils that others might appropriate. The struggle for security among the elite has been a race for the most far-reaching command possible, in other words, for control of production.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The development of nation-states lead to the struggle over industries central to social reproduction of economic life, which in turn lead to the dominance of a small number of elite families over these industries. The tendency towards monopolization closely knit with the intra-class conflict within the bourgeoisie is mutually determined by the inner tendencies of capital accumulation and pre-capitalist social forms such as caste. What the economists understood as externalities that hampered intended functioning of the market were rather immanent to the very functioning of the logic of capitalist accumulation; it is in the direct interests of the ruling class to reduce and hamper competition amongst themselves through subordinating one another while incentivizing competition in the working class to reduce wages.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>The discrepancy between the legal discourse<d-footnote>As Pashukanis argues, “The constitutional state is a mirage, but one which suits the bourgeoisie very well \[…\] Power as the 'collective will', as the 'rule of law'. is realised in bourgeois society to the extent that this society represents a market.” [Pashukanis, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism*, 147](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?uVZXCo).</d-footnote> of the abstract individual who can freely interact with the market and the actuality of unfreedom is highlighted by this tendency of monopolization immanent to class society. The assertion that <em>real</em> utopian ideals of liberalism qua capitalism is corrupted by what are <em>purportedly</em> external forces of the state and bureaucracy becomes the ideological rationalization of the struggle within the ruling class. Labels such as cronyism are attributed to those who gain an advantageous monopoly position through political and ideological connections with the existing state. The utopian ideal of liberalism naturalizes capitalist social relations as a fundamental part of human existence while simultaneously denying the immanent tendencies of capitalism. This highlights the actual non-identity of the concept of class; it designates the real unity of (bourgeois) interests of a class that is accompanied by its actual dis-unity.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 98</d-footnote> These discrepancies are accentuated during monopolization as the entirety of society is pitted against itself to gain control over resources necessary for social reproduction, members of a social strata attempt to better their social position while suppressing the members of strata below them—social mobility is intimately interwoven with the subordination of others within the constraints of class society.</p> <p>The development of organizational forms with a rigid hierarchy, which Horkheimer calls totalities, is not merely a result of the optimization mechanisms of the capitalist market that maximizes allocative efficiency of resources,<d-footnote>See R. H. Coase, “The Nature of the Firm,” *Economica* 4, no. 16 (November 1937): 386–405, [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x)</d-footnote> but rather contains within itself the history of struggle for the control over resources. The power relations that have developed over time and the optimization mechanisms of the market mutually determine each other. The concept of allocative efficiency is reframed as the most effective method of monopolizing resources that are not fully integrated into capitalist relations of production through what Marx called the original/primitive accumulation. While monopolies have always existed throughout the development of capitalism, the monopoly stage of capitalism only arises with the near-full integration of capital in social life and state vis-a-vis control over production by a small minority.</p> <p>For Paul A. Baran and Paul Sweezy, monopolies are big corporations that are highly efficient rational calculators for extracting social surplus. They are “profit maximizers and capital accumulators,” and “they are managed by company men whose fortunes are identified with the corporations’ success or failure.”<d-footnote>Paul A. Baran and Paul M. Sweezy, *Monopoly Capital: An Essay on the American Economic and Social Order*, (Monthly Review Press, 1968).</d-footnote> These monopolies start organizing normal economic life with aid from the state as they control the price system, tax and labour policy to maximize production and profitability of the corporation. Production is centralized in a small number of production units that are hierarchically organized for the efficient transfer of information and social control over the workers.<d-footnote>Otto Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” in *The Journal of Politics*, May, 1944, Vol. 6, No. 2, 139-176 [https://doi.org/10.2307/2125270](https://doi.org/10.2307/2125270); 148</d-footnote> This is accompanied by change in the production process (what Marx called real subsumption<d-footnote>In the economic manuscripts of 1861-63, Marx writes about the real subsumption of capitalism as changing the very nature of work to suit the needs of capital accumulation as opposed to formal subsumption, where surplus is extracted from pre-capitalist ways of production. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, MECW, Vol. 34 (Lawrence and Wishart, 1994\) 104–17.</d-footnote>): the scientific management of Taylor and the moving conveyor belts that fed the highly specialized division of labour of Ford.<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 145</d-footnote> Otto Kirchheimer in “Quest for Sovereignty” demonstrates that highly organized <em>hierarchical</em> monopolies efficiently “[respond] quite often to the needs of government” as self interested bourgeoise nation-states under specific conditions such as war, “leads to a wholesome transfer of public authority to the principal agencies of private self-administration.”<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, op. cit., 150</d-footnote> With hindsight, we can observe that the process of privatization has taken place regardless of any extraneous conditions. Hence, Adorno points out that with monopolization</p> <p>The ruling class disappears behind the concentration of capital. This latter has reached a magnitude and acquired a weight of its own that enables capital to present itself as an institution, as the expression of society as a whole. By virtue of its omnipotence, the particular is able to usurp the totality: this overall social aspect of capital is the endpoint of the old fetish character of the commodity according to which relations between men are reflected back to them as relations between things.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 99</d-footnote></p> <p>In the mid-20th century, monopoly capitalism could absorb the majority of the population into the production process—at least in the first world. This fundamentally changed with the further development of capitalism into neo-liberal capitalism with the regulation and creation of new markets in spheres that were previously managed by the state such as education.<d-footnote>David Harvey, *A Brief History of Neoliberalism* (Oxford University Press, 2005), 65</d-footnote> The result was a massive tide of exclusion from the production process, and therefore the expansion of what Marx called the relative surplus population.<d-footnote>“The labouring population therefore produces, along with the accumulation of capital produced by it, the means by which it itself is made relatively superfluous, is turned into a relative surplus population; and it does this to an always increasing extent.” Marx, *Capital*, 623</d-footnote> The expansion of the surplus population was simultaneously accompanied by the total integration of all aspects of life into the market.</p> <p>What, then, is the nature of class and class struggle with this furthering integration of capitalism into every facet of life? Horkheimer points out that during the revolutionary movements of the 19th and early 20th century, capitalism did not fully hold sway over every aspect of life—there were spaces with relative autonomy for individual entrepreneurs, subsistence producers, etc. As the impersonal market forces of capitalism began to dominate almost everyone with extending monopolization (and later on the advent of neoliberalism), class struggle fundamentally changes its form while the antagonisms of capitalism are heightened through, for example, the rapid expansion of the informal sector and imperialist super exploitation of the global south. As Horkheimer puts it,</p> <p>The development of capitalistic society according to its own inherent tendencies caused the progressive traits of competition to disappear. It severed the link between the needs of consumers and the profit-interest of the individual entrepreneur; it diminished the possibility, slight as it was, of an independent mind gaining access to an independent position; it reduced the number of relatively autonomous economic subjects, who by the very fact of that plurality had an interest in the functioning of general law and in its impartial administration. All this vanishes in the later stages of capitalism and allows society to revert to more direct forms of domination, which in fact never had been quite suspended.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> <p>For the early critical theorists, the rapid immiseration of the working class during moments of crisis undermined the institutions that rationalized conditions of subordination. Which rises the possibility of revolutionary aspirations in the working class to change the very conditions of social reproduction, hence the “resolute will of progressive groups to win the victory over the naked force of arms”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 60</d-footnote> of the ruling classes. However, Horkheimer points out that it is equally possible for reactionary forces to co-opt the anxieties caused by crisis to reinstate “outmoded cultural apparatuses” with intensified disciplinary power.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 60</d-footnote> With the universalization of the impersonal mechanisms of capitalism (the interlocking forms of market, law and the state), capitalism provides movements for radical progress and regression into explicit forms of social domination. For Horkheimer (and the rest of the institution), the monopoly stage of Capitalism was already a regress into barbarism. Class struggle had largely been replaced by <em>class adaptation</em> as a result of the development of highly integrated monopoly society, the working class’s relationship to “the different capitalistic groups [is] no longer radically different from those prevailing among the capitalistic groups themselves.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> This does not imply that the possibility of radical change disappears, but rather shows the forms of consciousness that develop in monopoly capitalism.</p>]]></content><author><name>Re Tejus</name></author><category term="Racketology"/><category term="report"/><category term="write-up"/><category term="study"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part 1 on the Frankfurt School's racket concept]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">From Racket Theory to Real Domination</title><link href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_Camatte/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="From Racket Theory to Real Domination"/><published>2025-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_Camatte</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_Camatte/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>In the early 1940s, the Frankfurt School developed a body of work—most of it only published posthumously decades later—that has been given the name ‘racket theory.’ That body of work is the topic of Section 2 of this essay.</p> <p>The other subject of this essay is the French (post-) Marxist theorist Jacques Camatte. In what follows I will be mostly concerned with works dating to before Camatte’s turn towards holocaust denial,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> homophobia,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> transphobia,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> anti-abortion politics, and the <em>nouvelle droite</em>. With regard to the thematic material, I will be focused on drawing out the aspects of Camatte’s work that resonate with the Frankfurt School’s racket theory.</p> <p>While my verdict on Camatte is fundamentally unfavorable, I have tried my best to keep the text from degenerating into an ultra-left version of the classic “my dad can beat up your dad” argument. Also, I started writing this before Camatte died; it is not a theoretical obituary. Special thanks to James Crane for translating most of the quotations from Horkheimer.</p> <h2 id="the-frankfurt-schools-racket-theory">The Frankfurt School’s Racket Theory</h2> <p>Let’s begin our crash course in racketology with a long quotation from Otto Kirchheimer:</p> <blockquote> <p>The term racket is a polemical one. It reflects on a society in which social position has increasingly come to depend on a relation of participation, on the primordial effect of whether an individual succeeded or failed to “arrive”. Racket connotes a society in which individuals have lost the belief that compensation for their individual efforts will result from the mere functioning of impersonal market agencies. But it keeps in equal distance from, and does not incorporate, the idea of a society wherein the antagonism between men and inanimate elements of production has been dissolved in the image of a free association for the common use of productive forces. It is the experience of an associational practice which implies that neither the individual’s choice of an association nor the aims that the latter pursues are the result of conscious acts belonging to the realm of human freedom.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>This gives us much of what is fundamental in the Frankfurt School’s critical appropriation of the concept of the racket, but it is too matter-of-fact, too much of a finished product. To get at the origin of their racket theory, we have to turn to an essay by Adorno entitled “Reflections on Class Theory.”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Relevant for my purposes are the following three sentences, which form a dialectical series:</p> <ol> <li>“All history is the history of class struggles because it was always the same thing, namely, prehistory.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></li> <li>“In the image of the latest economic phase, history is the history of monopolies.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></li> <li>“In the image of the manifest act of usurpation that is practiced nowadays by the leaders of capital and labor acting in consort, it is the history of gang wars and rackets.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></li> </ol> <p>I do not have the space for an extended reading of Adorno’s “Reflections,” so I am just going to translate the essential theses above into the problematic we discover in the broader racket theory corpus:</p> <p>A. The equation history = class struggles = prehistory poses a challenge on the terrain of theory: to find unity in history with reference to future freedom (communism-as-society) by and while positing class struggle as its motor (communism-as-the-real-movement).<br/> B. The ascendance of monopolies that abrogate the principle of economic competition requires a rethinking of the concept of class because “the concept of class […] is modeled on the bourgeoisie itself. As the anonymous unity of the owners of the means of production and their various appendages, the bourgeoisie is the class par excellence.”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Now “the ruling class disappears behind the concentration of capital;”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> it consists of monopolists and monolith social capital. Problem (A) is further complicated. History is the history of monopolies. (Thus, pseudo-marxisms: Veblen, progressivism, social democracy, theoretical Popular Frontism, etc.)<br/> C. Finally, the homological hierarchies of domination present in organized labor and monopoly capital throw the destiny of the proletariat into question. The return of direct domination is complemented by a tendency towards ‘voluntary’ conformism. Freedom becomes a dirty word.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p> <p>The theory of rackets, imagined in this way as a fragmentary response to Adorno’s inaugural essay, is an answer to the question of how theory can maintain the core of historical materialism (A) while undergoing a fundamental rethinking of the concept of class (B) and class struggle (C).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> I lack the space to explain it below, but Camatte’s problematic is similar. Now for racket theory proper.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>In the fragment “Die Rackets und der Geist,” Horkheimer writes that the racket is the “basic form of domination.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> This is because class society is itself a racket: “‘Ruling class’ always means the structure of rackets on the basis of a determinate mode of production, so far as they simultaneously protect and suppress the lowest strata.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Or again: “The structure [of every ruling class in history] has been that of competing rackets.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p> <p>The use of the term racket was inspired by what the members of the Frankfurt School (and many others) saw as the increasing monopolization of the capitalist economy, a process that entailed corresponding changes in politics and culture. The tendency within capitalism towards concentration and centralization “allows society to revert to more direct forms of domination, which in fact never had been quite suspended.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>But the ruling class is not the only racket. Racket-style organization, according to Horkheimer, now also predominates in the labor movement. This is part of a wider historical tendency: “Under the pressure of the ruling class, people within the ruled class are forced to become rulers against those who are even more powerless. The oppressed themselves still become, through this mediation, the direct executioner of those further down.”<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> Part of a wider historical tendency, but not identical with it! Horkheimer is clear, albeit pessimistically so, about the specific historical potential of the proletariat in the fragment “Geschichte der amerikanischen Arbeiterschaft” :</p> <blockquote> <p>The historical course of the proletariat led to a crossroads: it could become a class or a racket. Becoming a ‘racket’ would have meant privileges within national borders, becoming a ‘class’ would have meant world revolution. Leaders have robbed the proletariat of this decision.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The resignation of the proletariat’s historic task by the official labor movement, which for Horkheimer was emblemized by the American Federation of Labor and the German Social Democrats, meant that a strong distinction had to be made between radical and reformist (actually conformist) forms of class struggle.</p> <p>In the foregoing passages, Horkheimer is referring to a particular meaning of racket, namely the protection racket. This interpretation agrees with Horkheimer’s earlier claim in “The End of Reason” that “Protection is the archetype of domination.”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> The unity of protection and domination is one of two essential unifying characteristics of the various social forms to which Horkheimer gives the name racket. Thus: “The most general category of functions practiced by groups is protection. Groups maintain the conditions for the continuation of the division of labor in which they have favored standing; they uphold and violently ward off changes that could endanger their monopoly. They are rackets.”<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p> <p>The other essential characteristic of the racket is its particularism: “Every racket conspires against spirit, and all conspire against, among one another. The reconciliation of universal and particular is immanent to spirit; the racket is their irreconcilable opposition, disguised by ideas of unity and community.”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Competitiveness and hostility grow out of this fundamental particularism.</p> <p>This leaves us with the question of what exactly the purpose of the racket is as a form of social organization. Kirchheimer provides a rather direct answer: for him, the aim of all so-called racketeers is the “establishment of domination over a segment of the process of production or distribution.”<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Horkheimer sometimes provides similarly broad qualifications (“to get as large a share of power over men, goods and services as possible”), but in other places he places a distinct emphasis on the sphere of distribution or circulation. For instance:</p> <blockquote> <p>The concept of racket therefore refers to the big as well as to the small units; they all struggle for as great a share as possible of the surplus value. […] Emphasis is to be laid on the fact that the role of a group in production though determining to a great extent its share of consumption, has been in class society a good strategic position for grasping as much goods and services as possible in the sphere of distribution.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The emphasis on distribution in passages like the one above suggests a close connection to Friedrich Pollock’s theory of state capitalism,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> and indeed most commentators have interpreted Horkheimer in this way. Such interpretations ignore Horkheimer’s strong criticism of Pollock’s theory in the fragment “Die Ideologie der Politik Heute.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Adorno was perhaps even more repulsed by Pollock’s theory of state capitalism, writing to Horkheimer that “a critique [of Pollock’s essay “State Capitalism”] that would express my view of the matter would have been psychologically beyond my control” and going on to request that Horkheimer completely rewrite it.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> In my opinion, the analyses of Franz Neumann’s <em>Behemoth</em> bear greater resemblance to (Adorno and) Horkheimer’s theory than do those of Pollock’s essays on state capitalism.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p> <p>In any case, the racket theory had a broader scope than the theory of state capitalism. Older forms of social organization were also castigated: the family is a racket, gender is a racket, and so are the initiatory communities of so-called “primitive tribes.” Thus, Horkheimer applied the concept in a transhistorical manner, but he had his reasons for doing so. As far as he was concerned, the concept was only thinkable in the first place with reference to modern rackets: “The modern concept [of the racket] serves to describe past social relations. ‘The anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the monkey.’”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> The racket-style organization is only boiled down to its essence in the modern racket.</p> <p>Horkheimer’s condemnation of rackets is wide-ranging, but it is not an attack on organization <em>as such</em> or even all organizations contemporaneous to his work. A handful of fragments and texts from the 1940s provide us with indications of what Horkheimer thought a revolutionary organization would look like. For starters, a non-racket organization in class society can only be a fighting organization “with its point directed upwards,” but such organizations “have no place in the established hierarchy, are without regular economic function, and, after periods of illegality, live on in revolutionary actions.”<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> Horkheimer had previously condemned the tendency of reformist opposition to become integrated into capitalism in “Authoritarian State,” writing that “Whatever seeks to extend itself under domination runs the danger of reproducing it.”<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p> <p>More concretely, Horkheimer was a proponent of workers’ council democracy.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> In the racket theory corpus, he and Adorno repeatedly assert that workers are capable of taking over and competently managing the present system of production.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> He closely read the articles on the Spanish Civil War that Karl Korsch sent him, and scattered positive references to the anarchists of Spain may indicate sympathy for Korsch’s argument that they were the successors of the revolutionary spirit of 1917.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p> <h2 id="camattes-theory-of-the-real-domination-of-capital">Camatte’s Theory of the Real Domination of Capital</h2> <p>Now I turn to summary and analysis of the relevant parts of Jacques Camatte’s oeuvre. I am concerned in particular with Series II of <em>Invariance</em> (i.e., the years 1971-1975), which is dominated in content by Camatte’s ambiguous rejection of most of Marxism (or “the theory of the proletariat” as he calls it).<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p> <p>Theory of the material community of capital and real domination. Camatte’s eccentric reading of texts such as the <em>Grundrisse</em> and “Results of the Immediate Process of Production” lead him to create two new and interrelated concepts to describe the present form of capitalism.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> The first is the <em>real domination of capital</em>, a ‘creative’ gloss on Marx’s abortive theory of the <em>real subsumption of labor under capital</em>. The real domination of capital refers to the domination of <em>the whole of society</em> by capital and the relegation of human existence to a mere moment in the valorization process. According to Camatte, this real domination grows out of the predominance of fixed capital and relative surplus value in the production process of capital—factors which increasingly render the proletariat secondary (if not irrelevant) to the production process.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> Domination of the proletariat in the production process by means of fixed capital is then extended to mastery of the entire valorization process including circulation and eventually the real domination of society as a whole. The second concept—the material community of capital—is closely related, but distinct. The material community of capital is what supplanted the human communities (<em>Gemeinwesen</em>) of pre-capitalist modes of production. Camatte once wrote a letter to his comrade Gianni Collu explaining the concept of <em>Gemeinwesen</em> or community; he wrote that it is “the substance of the social reality of humans” and “a superior unity above all the state-unities, above the unending mob of organizations;” individuals are mere accidents of this substance.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> The establishment of capital’s real domination went hand-in-hand with its constitution as the material community of humanity. The alienated human community (capitalism) is mediated and reproduced by the socio-material processes of capital, i.e. the production and exchange of commodities within the valorization process of capital. With the advent of capital’s real domination of humanity, the material community becomes autonomous and self-reproducing, as capital is now the ground for all social institutions (e.g., the state, etc.). Capital posits its own presuppositions and becomes the presupposition of humanity. What was previously mystification now becomes real and effective. Capital dispenses with gold and value and becomes its own tautologous representation.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p> <p>Capital has thus succeeded in “[absorbing] the movement that negates it, the proletariat,” and, consequently, “all forms of working-class political organization have disappeared.”<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> At the same time, capitalists are absorbed into the automatic functioning of capital. Class conflict therefore goes the way of the dodo and is replaced by inconsequential squabbles between the gangs/rackets/organizations/groups “which are the varied modes of being of capital.”<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> Camatte explains further: “This mode of being [the gang-racket] arises from the fact that capital can only valorize itself, and hence only exist and develop its being, if a particle of itself, now autonomized, confronts the whole of society, positing itself in relation to the total-socialized equivalent, capital. [Capital] needs this confrontation (competition, emulation) because it only exists through differentiation.”<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> It is unclear if Camatte came to the word ‘racket’ by himself or if he learned it from the Frankfurt School. The former case is very plausible, as most of the texts from the Frankfurt School that presaged Camatte’s new theoretical path vis-a-vis “rackets” would not be published for several years.</p> <p>The eclipse of the proletariat by capital had consequences for practice and organization. Camatte and Collu give two points of departure for future practice: “refuse to reconstitute a group, even an informal one” and “maintain a network of personal contacts with people having realized (or in the process of doing so) the highest degree of theoretical knowledge: antifollowerism, antipedagogy; the party in its historical sense is not a school.”<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> Camatte further spelled out the practical implications of “On Organization” in a 1970 letter to his comrades:</p> <blockquote> <p>…we could be a certain number of revolutionaries without forming a group, even informally (that is to say, non-structured), but evidently this is only possible tendentially, in the sense that it is only through theoretical activity that we can avoid the traps laid for us by capitalist society. In other words, we cannot be a group and still play a part in the unification of the class that must develop presently; this can only happen if we consider ourselves as the heart of the movement [!?]; if we do not become autonomous [s’autonomise]; if, therefore, we see ourselves as an element of the becoming-unification, not as an instrument, a means to bring it about. This is why there is no interior and exterior.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>This effectively put Camatte on a level with (or even below) the <em>attentistes</em> of the French councilist group Informations et Correspondances Ouvrières (ICO),<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> although the emphasis on theoretical activity—and the belief that this groupuscular theoretical activity is of world-historical importance—gives his take a distinctively Bordigist flair.</p> <p>Texts following “On Organization” have a somewhat softer position; Camatte even had some backhanded compliments for the French Maoist movement!<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> The change in tone was connected to his latest prophetic vision: “Since [May ‘68] there has begun inside the universal class […] a struggle which will lead to the revolutionization of this class and its constitution as a party-community, the first moment of its negation.”<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> The party (-community) of which Camatte speaks is the <em>historical party</em>, i.e. communism qua ‘the real movement.’ The editor-in-chief of <em>Invariance</em> saw the new organizations of the 1960s as momentary, fragmented expressions of the movement—already underway!—that would negate ‘the proletariat’ and unify the new ‘universal class’ (which includes the “middle classes”) en route to the “immediate triumph of communism.”<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p> <p>Once we get into <em>Invariance</em>’s third series, it becomes clear that after about 1973 Camatte broke with any and all remotely conventional ideas of revolution. “Resistance,” he writes, “is a disguised [form of] waiting, an unspoken hope that the world’s course may still change.”<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> Instead of resisting, we must “leave the world,” create “communist forms” and “new modes of action,” embrace non-violence, etc. “Men and women will come to realize that they themselves are the determining elements, and that they do not have to abdicate their power to the machine…”<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> Camatte’s thinking has reached complete tautology. There is no longer anything in it worth discussing.</p> <h2 id="remarks-in-place-of-a-conclusion">Remarks (In Place of a Conclusion)</h2> <p>The similarities between Horkheimer and Adorno’s theory and that of Camatte are striking. Furthermore, direct inspiration from the Frankfurt School is (probably) not the decisive factor in Camatte’s intellectual development—although surely there was some degree of it, especially in the 1970s. I consider both the Frankfurt School’s racket theory and Camatte’s work to be failed theoretical programs, albeit ones with rational kernels. However, I also think that the Frankfurt School’s failure is more compelling, interesting, and important.</p> <p>A key difference between the Frankfurt School and Camatte lies in their conceptions of reconciliation, utopia, and revolution. Camatte is harmonistic, whereas the Frankfurt School is therapeutic.</p> <p>Camatte’s elliptical descriptions of communism betray this harmonistic tendency. His basic stance is defined by the thesis that communism “is not a question of having or of doing, but of being.”<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> It “is not a new mode of production; it is the affirmation of a new community.”<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> These abstract-metaphysical theses contrast with the Frankfurt School’s indications of what communism would look like, which are generally negative.</p> <p>The harmonism is also present in his descriptions of revolution and transition. In the texts of <em>Invariance</em> Series I, the transition simply appears as a series of policies (all taken from Bordiga) easily enacted by the omnipotent class-party-state-community: abolition of the separation between economic enterprises, shortening of the working day, cessation of all commodity exchange, disalienation of labor, etc. To that extent, and only to that extent, the early Camatte is guilty of “[degrading] the revolution to mere progress.”<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> Subsequent treatments of the topic in Series II of <em>Invariance</em> degenerate into the fairytale prophecies summarized above. In Camatte’s mature work, the mechanical predictions of vulgar historical materialism—predictions which at least had the pretension of being scientific—are replaced by a willfully abstract belief in humanity. Despite the continuous and drastic changes in his theory, one never finds any trace of genuine autocritique in Camatte, only the mind-numbingly repetitious discourse of a pseudosagelike know-it-all. The puppet called “Gemeinwesen” is always supposed to win.</p> <p>The works of the Frankfurt School, by contrast, are suffused with the awareness that what has been lost can never be regained, not really.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> Even the dead are not safe from the enemy, and we have scarcely any idea what victory would look like. Thus Benjamin:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whoever wishes to know what the situation of a ‘redeemed humanity’ might actually be, what conditions are required for the development of such a situation, and when this development can be expected to occur, poses questions to which there are no answers. He might just as well seek to know the color of ultraviolet rays.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Benjamin’s polemical denial that we can have any idea of what redemption looks like is complemented by Adorno’s negative utopianism. The utopian can and does appear to us, but only fleetingly through reflection. Adorno’s descriptions of the good life are gnomically simple: it is “life without fear” or “a world in which no one goes hungry.” In Horkheimer’s early work, on the other hand, we find a certain cynicism and an awareness of the tragic element in everything. Revolution is nothing metaphysical; it is simply a matter of pain, hunger, and misery, of sufferings that can never be repaid. Socialism is not the perfection of humanity.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> Nor is either revolution or socialism a sure thing: “the experience of our generation,” Benjamin wrote, was that “capitalism will not die a natural death.”<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup></p> <p>Adorno and Horkheimer’s reflective meditations have a greater edificatory—and indeed truly <em>mystical</em>—effect than Camatte’s attempts at intuitive illumination, to say nothing of Benjamin’s Marxist mysticism.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> Camatte’s trajectory as a thinker is something like Benjamin’s intellectual life being played backwards. Instead of moving from mysticism to Marxism, it is his later works which are characterized by sophomoric metaphysics and infatuation with reactionary mystics (Klages, Bachofen, etc.).</p> <p>The most compelling part of Camatte’s work—the concept of the material community of capital—predates his turn away from Marxism. Again there is a striking resemblance to the Frankfurt School—here I refer to Adorno’s analysis of (capitalist) society as a reified totality.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> One of the key differences relates to <em>analysis</em> in its original sense: breaking things down. Camatte explicitly refused the possibility of this, claiming that capital has overridden its logical elements and presupposed categories (the commodity, value, money, labor, etc.). Conversely, Adorno tended to center the basic exchange relation, and hence the aforementioned elementary categories. (I think many people who take influence from Camatte actually interpret the material community concept with reference to the elementary concepts, hence in a Lukácsian-Adornian manner.) Camatte began with the real subsumption of labor within the immediate process of production and then extrapolated this into the real domination of humanity by capital, whereas Adorno, being more sociologically cautious, focused on the expansion of commodity fetishism to cover greater and greater parts of social life. In my opinion, the Lukács-Adorno approach has infinitely more analytical potency than Camatte’s deliberately flattened social ontology.</p> <p>As I said before, I believe that both theories are ultimately failures. The difference lies in what they offer as salvage for thinking, in the potential for a critical re-appropriation of their analysis. The Frankfurt School’s incomplete conversations about rackets offer more for this purpose than Camatte’s impenetrable monologue on real domination.<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Jacques Camatte, <a href="https://www.ilcovile.it/xenia/revueinvariance/evanescence.html">“Évanescence du mythe antifasciste”</a> (1982) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>Jacques Camatte, <a href="https://www.ilcovile.it/xenia/revueinvariance/amourcombinatoire.html">“Amour ou combinatoire sexuelle”</a> (1978) <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Jacques Camatte, <a href="https://libcom.org/article/interview-jacques-camatte-2019">“Interview with Cercle Marx”</a> (2019) <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>Otto Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty” in <em>The Journal of Politics</em>, May, 1944, Vol. 6, No. 2, 139-176; 161. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:5"> <p>Theodor Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942) in <em>Can One Live After Auschwitz?

Moreover, that the radicality of their work is validated in their apprehension it would be forgotten in the same dynamic stasis (<em>Sempre erranti e sempre qui!</em>)<d-footnote>Horkheimer: "The individual no longer has a personal history. Though everything changes, nothing moves. He needs neither a Zeno nor a Cocteau, neither an Eleatic dialectician nor a Parisian surrealist, to tell what the Queen in *Through the Looking Glass* means when she says, 'It takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place, or what Lombroso's madman expressed in his beautiful poem: *Noi confitti al nostro orgoglio / Come ruote in ferrei perni, / Ci stanchiamo in giri eterni, / Sempre erranti e sempre qui!*'' *Eclipse of Reason*. (Bloomsbury, 2013), 112.</d-footnote> which would re-engender the very need that first engendered it. To the extent early critical theory seems to us to have a tragic character, this does not derive from the fact it has largely been forgotten, but from the fact it is still needed at all. For us, as for the early critical theorists themselves, the enduring validity of the critical theory of society, of its critical diagnostic of capitalist society and its social theorists, is a bitter confirmation that its dream is still unrealized. Critical Theory is only right in a wrong world.</p> <p>Following recent scholarship on the origin and formation of critical theory (a period stretching from the late 1910s through the early 1940s, though we focus on the 1930s), our recovery takes its point of orientation from the intersection of two premises. First, early critical theory was—and can only be adequately understood and evaluated as—a development and extension of the Marxian critique of political economy, which inherited the impulses of dissident (and particularly councilist) communism. Second, the traditional, and still predominant, reception of early critical theory has not interpreted it as such given, on the one hand, the popular context, intellectual and political, in which it has been received since the student movements of the late 60s,<d-footnote>Cf. Chris O'Kane. "On Frankfurt School Critical Theory and Political Economy."

Noerr &amp; Ziege (Springer VS, Wiesbaden, 2019) 10-11.</d-footnote></p> <p>This esoteric form of early critical theory is configured by three elements: tactical self-censorship, esoteric technique, and the negative method of presentation required by the dialectical conception of the critique of political economy. To a much larger degree than has been appreciated, their esotericism can be explained by ‘tactical’ considerations of the benefits of implementing self-censorship protocols in the hostile, anti-communist conditions of their theoretical production in exile, as is especially evident from their correspondence. However, as an esoteric <em>technique</em>, it was more than a tactic. It was an expression of the refusal to capitulate in thought to those compromises required of them in fact.</p> <blockquote> <p>The Institute’s original organ of publication was the Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, which appeared in German from 1932-1939.

Stephen Eric Bronner &amp; Douglas Mackay Kellner (Routledge, 1989), 77-78</d-footnote>—and “<em>there is only one theory.</em>”</p> <blockquote> <p>What do we actually mean by “essence”? Even in Marx, the tension between essence and appearance is due to the fact that he sees society under the aspect of communism. (...) We formulate in the manner of Spinoza. The essence in appearance consists in a relationship of the phenomenon, what is given, to what is possible. There is only one theory.<d-footnote>Horkheimer [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12.* (1985), 523-524. Author's translation.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In addition to implementing protocols of tactical self-censorship under pressure and elaborating an esoteric technique in protest, the early critical theorists insist on a negative method of presentation derived from the conception of the <em>critique</em> inherent to the critique of political economy itself: “Marxist science constitutes the critique of bourgeois economy and not the expounding of a socialist one.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Authoritarian State" [1942], Trans.

The consistency of logical forms, the necessity of the dialectical deductions correspond here to the natural necessity with which economic principles prevail in the reality of this society. Other forms of presentation as well as other theoretical methods would, therefore, be appropriate to a condition of enhanced freedom and a more rational social structure. These cant be anticipated now.<d-footnote>Horkheimer to Grossmann, 10/1/1935. *A Life in Letters. Selected Correspondence by Max Horkheimer*. Ed. &amp; translated by Evelyn M. Jacobson, Manfred R.

Author's translation.</d-footnote></p> <p>Throughout the archive of posthumously published writings, the “concept of reason” that early critical theory seeks to realize is given an unambiguous determination: “Classless society in the critical sense.”<d-footnote>Adorno and Horkheimer [1939]. *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 514. Author's translation.</d-footnote> However, already in the original publication of “Traditional and Critical Theory” (1937) in the <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em>, Horkheimer defines the idea of critical theory as such through a negative formulation of the communist program:</p> <blockquote> <p>Critical theory, despite the clarity it may have into the individual steps of social transformation and the agreement of its elements with those of the most advanced traditional theories, has no authority of its own except the concern for the abolition of class domination [<em>Interesse an der Aufhebung der Klassenherrschaft</em>] connected with it.<d-footnote>"Traditionelle und kritische Theorie". ZfS vol. 6, no. 2, pages 245-294,(1937), 291-292. Author's translation. The extant English translation in *Critical Theory* (2002) is based on the revision of the essay under Horkheimer's direction for the republication of a selection of his early essays in German in 1968, which substitutes "*gesellschaftliche* *Unrecht*" [social injustice] for "*Klassenherrschaft*" [class domination].</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>As Christian Voller has recently demonstrated, even under self-imposed censorship protocols, the description of a “rationally organized society” which constitutes the normative horizon of the most circumspect early critical theorists—Adorno and Horkheimer in particular—is drawn almost verbatim from a single passage in Marx and Engels’ <em>The German Ideology</em>.<d-footnote>Christian Voller, *In der Dämmerung*. *Studien zu Vor- und Frühgeschichte der Kritische Theorie* (Matthes &amp; Seitz, 2023), 61-63.</d-footnote></p> <blockquote> <p>Communism differs from all previous movements in that it overturns the basis of all earlier relations of production and intercourse, and for the first time consciously treats all natural premises as the creatures of hitherto existing men, strips them of their natural character and subjugates them to the power of the united individuals.<d-footnote>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. *Vol. 5 of Collected Works*. (Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1976), 81.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>This idea of a “rationally organized society,” Horkheimer explains in a letter of 1938, “coincides with that of the association of free human beings,” and this “coincidence of which we speak is brought about by the socialization of the means of production and the abolition of classes and is ever-renewed by the active participation of individuals in administration.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer to Adolph Lowe, (1/4/1938). *MHGS Vol. 16* (1995), 353-354.

Trans. Jephcott &amp; ed. Noerr (2007), 71.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>This is most explicit in essays such as Adorno’s “Theses on Need” (1942) and Horkheimer’s “Authoritarian State” (1942), in which ‘the democracy of the councils’ is presented as the completion of socialist construction or ‘socialization’ suppressed (but possibly latent) in state socialism, as the measure of the betrayal of democracy under the formal equality of liberal principles in crisis-prone capitalist societies, and as the antithesis of fascist nationalization that re-privatizes public functions in the hands of warring cliques which vie to be the dominant particularity of a universal state.<d-footnote>Adorno, "Theses on Need" [1942], Translation by David Fernbach. *New Left Review 128* (2021): 79-82.

The roots of the council system go back to 1871, 1905, and other events. Revolutionary transformation has a tradition that must continue.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Authoritarian State" [1942], *Telos* (1973), 10.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>The “obstinacy” with which the critical theorist smashes the fetishes which occlude its realization of “the association of free human beings in which each has the same possibility of self-development” and sifts through the <em>caput mortuum</em> of modern humanity for traces of its possibility is what gives early critical theory its fragility, its “common bond” with “fantasy.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer. "Traditional and Critical Theory" [1937]. *Critical Theory* (2002), 219-220. Translation modified.</d-footnote> The universalized republic of councils is the contested possibility of mediation between universal and particular interest, the telos of any truly revolutionary internationalism, the emancipation of humanity and nature from the compulsions of capital accumulation through which humanity might be realized for the first time, and the concretion of self-enlightening of enlightenment.</p> <blockquote> <p>With the thoroughgoing organization of humanity towards a common plan, alienation ends, because no one confronts it as alien anymore. The process is completed when the universal plan is no longer forced upon the individual by external violence, even if that plan is ideologically disguised as ones own. (...) This was Marxist reason, the free association of humanity, free from the unplanned effects of social power. Only then, when each in their conduct becomes a means of the whole, do they also become an end to the whole and to themselves. Once the means is fully recognized as an end, we are freed from the domination of means. (...) The only rescue for thinking tired of the triumph of means is to drive it to the point of reversal. It is not true that enlightenment is at an end.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Magic of the Concept" (1949). *MHGS Vol. 12* (1985), 323-325. Author's translation</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>The modest contribution of early critical theory consists in providing a model for the exploration and comprehension of, as a fellow traveler will later express it, “the aporia intrinsic to socialist activity between the daily struggle and the goal beyond the limits of that struggle, which therefore cannot secure itself in advance.”<d-footnote>Gillian Rose, *The Broken Middle: Out of Our Ancient Society*.

(2002), 251.</d-footnote> This negative unity of opposites—restless critique of this world and unwavering aim at its abolition—is the “illusion-free orientation” into which early critical theory would initiate us.<d-footnote>Horkheimer to Wittfogel, (8/21/1935), *MHGS Vol. 15* (1995), 389-391.

More than that, we seek to hold them to the measure of these terms without making excuses for them. To paraphrase Horkheimer’s critique of the apologetic reception of Nietzsche, the eloquence which would cover for their naivete and illusions, or excuse them as ‘thinkers of their time,’ delivers them, having been made presentable and thereby unintelligible, over to the same society against which their antagonism was uncompromising and within which they were compromised.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Bemerkungen zu Jaspers' 'Nietzsche.' " *ZfS* V6, Issue 2, 1937, 407-414.</d-footnote> To paraphrase Adorno’s critique of the apologetic reception of Kierkegaard, for the thorns they felt stinging their own flesh and turned against society, they deserve, at the very least, faithful rather than deferential exegesis.<d-footnote>Adorno, "[Double review of Wahl, Jean *Etudes Kierkegaardiennes* &amp; Lowrie, Walter *The Journals of Soren Kierkegaard*]." *ZfS* Jahrgang 8: 1939-1940; V8, Issue 1/2, 1939, 232-235.</d-footnote> To express this polemically: the living kernels of early critical theory from the works of the early critical theorists cannot be recovered apart from the partisan criticism of capitalism, the early critical theorists themselves, and their critics.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>In the following essays, the “non-dogmatic”<d-footnote>Cf.

Responding in kind, Parker challenges Marcuse’s transcendental-idealistic methodological presuppositions, according to which the task of the theorist is discovering the schematism through which the thought of a historical period is determined on the basis of an historical a priori set of conditions of possibility, which prevent Marcuse from fulfilling this desideratum. Instead, Parker argues for an alternative model for theorizing the social determination of thought: beginning from detail-oriented analysis of historical material, reconstruction of the asymmetric relations of reciprocal determination between changes in the economic base (broadly considered) and the philosophical-ideological superstructure, with a focus on the analysis of the role of class-situated subjective mediation in the translation of objective conditions into determinations of thought. The majority of the essay is a test of this model in the case of the emergence of the concept of essence in ancient Greece, which provides the basis for a criticism of competing accounts of the advent of philosophy in Greek antiquity offered by historians and the early critical theorists themselves (from Sohn-Rethel to Adorno).</p> <p>In “On the Falsity of Prevailing Ideas: The Concept of Ideology in Early Critical Theory,” Samuel J. Thomas argues for the importance of Horkheimer’s critique of Karl Mannheim’s <em>Ideology and Utopia</em> in the early 1930s for a <em>critical theory of ideology</em>.<d-footnote>For a supplementary précis of Mannheim's *Ideology and Utopia*, see Samuel J. Thomas, "Précis of Mannheim's Ideology and Utopia." CTWG Blog, November 12, 2024. &lt;https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2024/Mannheim/&gt;</d-footnote> Distinguishing between <em>Ideologietheorie</em> and <em>Ideologiekritik</em>, Thomas demonstrates that Horkheimer’s critique of the methodology of Mannheim’s ‘value-free’ ‘sociology of knowledge’ (<em>Wissenssoziologie</em>) turns on this distinction and, moreover, on the problematic and unreflective separation of these moments in Mannheim’s project. In the course of this reconstruction, Thomas develops a model for diagnosing the pitfalls of more contemporary, one-sided approaches to theories and critiques of ideology and argues that the singular difficulty of analyzing ideology under the conditions of capitalist social relations requires the adoption of a specific conception of the dialectical method. Presenting the unity of <em>Ideologietheorie</em> and <em>Ideologiekritik</em> in Horkheimer’s own work throughout the 1930s, in which ideology <em>theory</em> focuses on the functional role of ideology in relations of class domination and ideology <em>critique</em> focuses on the relation between ideology and totality (as well as ideological theories of ideology and totality), Thomas contextualizes Horkheimer’s own conception of ideology as self-contextualizing. This is required by the self-reflexive core of the critical theory of ideology, which Thomas calls the ‘double determination’ of any inquiry into ideology itself: the mode in which capitalist social totality determines the object of analysis and the subject of the researcher who seeks to offer a theory or critique of ideology. After exhibiting this approach in the case of Horkheimer’s own analysis of the bourgeois revolutionary in the figure of Tommaso Campanella (inter alia), Thomas concludes with polemical suggestions for the further development of the critical theory of ideology.</p> <p>In “Analytic Social Psychology as Critical Social Theory,” J.E. Morain recovers the early work of Erich Fromm, a foundational and unjustly neglected figure in accounts of the formation of early critical theory—specifically, the ISR’s project of developing an ‘analytic social psychology,’ which would provide the conceptual scaffolding of the group’s <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em> (1936) and, arguably, the framework and foci of the ‘socio-psychological’ approach to empirical research the ISR would use throughout the 1940s, culminating in <em>The Authoritarian Personality</em> (1950).<d-footnote>See Morain's recent report on research conducted at the Erich Fromm archive on the CTWG blog, which reconstructs the systematic, Marxian conception Fromm contributed to the ISR's *Studien über Autorität und Familie* (1936): "The Origins of Studien über Autorität und Familie." CTWG Blog, April 27, 2024. &lt;https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2024/origins_of_the_family/&gt;</d-footnote> In this essay, Morain begins with a critical survey of secondary literature on Fromm’s contribution to ‘The Frankfurt School,’ which, on the whole, has read Fromm from a ‘standpoint of redemption’ that assumes the condemnation of his work from the outset. In Morain’s reconstructive-reparative approach, Fromm is restored to his role as the author of the interdisciplinary synthesis of historical materialism and classical psychoanalysis that underlies the ISR’s famous ‘Freudo-Marxism’: explanations of the large-scale social phenomena posited by historical materialism on the basis of the psychic dynamics of individuals as conceived by Freudian psychoanalysis. Fromm’s approach is shown to outfit early critical theory with the <em>‘microfoundations’</em> of their conception of social reproduction. In explicit and militant opposition to any transhistorical theory of human motivation or ‘interests’ in the life of society, as well as to the vulgar Marxist theory of ‘reflection,’ Fromm reorients social psychology to an analysis of the <em>mediation</em> of economic ‘base’ and ideological ‘superstructure,’ social existence and social consciousness, by the network of institutions in which the psychic character of individuals is formed—for the sake of producing functional, capitalist subjects—in the course of capitalist social reproduction as a whole. In particular, Fromm’s focus is on the <em>family</em> as a complex of mediations, which serves, Fromm argues, as the primary agent of socialization and influence on the social formation of psychic character-structure. Morain differentiates Fromm’s particular appropriation psychoanalytic theory from that of Freudian orthodoxy and develops Fromm’s distinctive conception of ‘analytic social psychology’ in a reconstruction of three basic concepts: social-psychic ‘cement’ (distinct from ‘ideology’ proper), ‘the psychic structure of society,’ and a unique concept of ‘ideology’ in social reproduction, which, in conjunction, provide the elements for Fromm’s social-psychological ‘crisis’ theory, according to which, as Fromm puts it in his inaugural essay in the <em>ZfS</em>, “the libidinal energies” which comprise the social-psychic cement “no longer serve the preservation of the society, but contribute to the development of new social formations. They cease to be ‘cement,’ and turn into dynamite.”<d-footnote>Fromm, "The Method and Function of an Analytic Social Psychology: Notes on Psychoanalysis and Historical Materialism" [1932]. *The Essential Frankfurt School Reader*. Ed. Andrew Arato and Eike Gebhardt. (New York: Continuum, 1977), 495.</d-footnote> Morain concludes with a critique of three main limitations in Fromm’s work in light of further developments—past or potential—in the project of developing an ‘analytic social psychology.’</p> <p>In “Horkheimer’s Materialism vs Morals and Metaphysics: Its Limitations and Possibilities,” Esther Planas Balduz tackles the problem of the normative orientation of early critical theory through immanent critique of Horkheimer’s foundational essays on Marxist materialism for the <em>ZfS</em>: “Materialism and Metaphysics” (1932) and “Materialism and Morals” (1932).<d-footnote>Cf. "ZfS in English." CTWG Blog, November 6, 2024. &lt;https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2023/ZfS/&gt;</d-footnote> Namely: how can we account for the moral dimension of the Marxist materialist’s critique of morality? Notwithstanding the critique of ‘value-free’ social theory in early critical theory as a whole, and in Horkheimer’s work in particular, Horkheimer himself criticizes moral conflicts, particularly in moral philosophy, for failing to recognize that they occur in the context of a world that is itself wrong, a society that is itself unjust. Planas Balduz begins here, interrogating the perspective from which the value judgment which assesses the world qua society as a totality has been—and, perhaps, ought to be—made. In the course of the essay, Planas Balduz reconstructs the method with which Horkheimer traces the categories of ‘materialism,’ ‘morality,’ and ‘metaphysics’ proper to each of these fields of judgment back to the constitutive, modern tension between ‘subjective’ and ‘social’ value judgments about what is considered socially and personally unbearable. In the above-mentioned foundational essays on Marxist materialism, Horkheimer argues that, and shows us how, sociology and positivist philosophy repeat this core tension through the rejection of value judgement, which binds them to their negative doubles—idealist moral philosophy of unconditional obligation and proto-totalitarian romanticism of unconditional self-determination. It is precisely because of the power of Horkheimer’s critique of ‘value-free’ social theory and science which, Planas Balduz concludes, compels us to pose two questions. First, given Horkheimers concern in these essays with questions of the individual in relation to the moral law, how can we relate his arguments to the position of the individual relative to the ‘second nature’ laws of the capitalist market? Or: in what sense is Horkheimer’s ‘materialist’ critique of morality materialist? Second, to the extent that materialism requires a critique of morality, how can we reconcile this with the need to confront the a-moral morality in the critique of socialism in neoliberal social thought? Or: does Horkheimer’s moral anti-moralism have its own negative double in the hegemonic discourse of the present?</p> <p>In “On the Social Situation of Adorno’s Critical Music Theory,” Zach Loeffler restores Adorno’s eccentric musical perspective in the early 1930s—represented in particular by his first published contribution to early critical theory in the ISR’s orbit, “On the Social Situation of Music” (1932)—to its own ‘social situation’: namely, as an effort to elaborate the theoretical consequences of direct proletarian action and worker militancy in the first years of the Weimar Republic, its brutal suppression, and its ongoing structural absence for a critical theory of artistic production. In the course of the essay, Loeffler reinterprets “Social Situation” through the late self-critique Adorno provides of the essay more than three decades later, reconstructing the re-articulation of Adorno’s theory of music through the reconfiguration of several ambivalences through which his earlier theoretical perspective develops. In the course of this reinterpretation, Adorno’s late musical theory is itself read in light of the young Adorno’s project of thinking music in its total ‘social situation.’ The perspective which emerges is as follows: if music is to do justice to the promise of fulfillment made by bourgeois art, then it must embody the truth of the untruth of capitalism and in turn something of a truly free, non-instrumental sociality bridging the gap between theory and revolutionary praxis; and if music is to do these things, then its material must be rationalized past the point where class society necessarily cuts rationalization short, a process which renders music socially mute and functionless. The musical rearticulation of Adornos critical theory therefore makes legible the Marxism of "consummate negativity" and maximalist communism that form the crux of his work, rendering concrete the negotiation of the problem of freedom vis-à-vis theory and praxis in the face of intractable social compulsion and the concrete possibility of realizing its mirror image.</p> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Adorno, Theodor W. “Traditionelle und kritische Theorie”. <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> 6 (1937)(2): 245–294. doi:10.5840/zfs19376265.</p> <p>———. “Double review of Wahl, Jean Etudes Kierkegaardiennes Lowrie, Walter The Journals of Soren Kierkegaard”. <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> 8 (1939)(1/2): 232–235.</p> <p>———. <em>Hegel: Three Studies</em>.

Robert C. Tucker (Norton, 1978), 84.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>I’ve never read an account of the socio-historical determination of philosophy that fully satisfied me. There always seems to be some level of mediation missing, some level of distortion or sleight of hand at play in the explanatory framework. This problem really crystallized for me when I read and presented on Marcuse’s essay “The Concept of Essence” with the Critical Theory Working Group last fall. The way it subsumed the history of philosophy under its gaze thrilled me at the same time as it set off alarm bells in the back of my mind. Its attack on the ahistorical pretensions of philosophy appealed to the historical materialist in me and its systematic account of Marxism as a theory of essence appealed to the philosopher in me. At the same time, I had a nagging sense that something was amiss on both counts, and I couldn’t really see how it all fit together. As I continued to engage with it, I began to suspect that the specter of totalization, which had been part of the essay’s initial appeal, covered over a number of confusions and deficiencies that prevented it from fulfilling the promises that I had originally read into it. These promises are of 1) a historical materialist account of the origins and development of the concept of essence that grounds both in the social conditions from which they arose and 2) a marxist theory of essence that facilitates the project of revolutionary praxis in the present day. I still believe that attempting to fulfill these promises is a worthwhile project, although one that (perhaps predictably) cannot be completed within the bounds of a single essay. With that in mind, I will focus here on laying the groundwork for that larger project, using Marcuse’s essay as a jumping-off point for developing my own historical materialist account of the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in Ancient Greece.<d-footnote>I do not mean to claim that this emergence represented the absolute origins of the concept of essence in a world historical sense, but rather to take it as an example of the emergence of that concept from out of a milieu in which it had previously been absent (and one that appears to have been foundational for the tradition we refer to as Western or European philosophy).</d-footnote></p> <p>In Part 1, I will begin with a critical examination of Marcuse’s account of the historical development of essence and the reasons for its failure to realize what it set out to achieve. I will argue that the most important of these reasons involve a formalist interpretive apparatus and the subsumption of the historical materialist elements in his work under an idealist philosophy of history, which lead him to neglect the concrete socio-historical conditions under which the concept of essence emerged in Ancient Greece. After that I will address the work of Alfred Sohn-Rethel, which bears some superficial similarities to the investigation undertaken here, but shares many of the problems that plagued Marcuse’s account, and use the discussion of his work as an opportunity to further distinguish my project from both of theirs.</p> <p>In Part 2, I will begin my reconstruction of the social determination of the emergence of the concept of essence in Ancient Greece, starting with the pre-history of the concept of essence. This will involve 1) an examination of what I will call the bardic conception of truth and its situation within an earlier mode of production centered around the warrior-aristocracy depicted in the Homeric epics 2) an account of how the reciprocal dynamic of commercialization and the centralization of slavery within the mode of exploitation, along with changes in the practice of warfare, created a crisis of the traditional warrior aristocracy and the mode of production centered on them, which set the stage for the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in Pre-Socratic Monism (PSM) and 3) a concluding examination of the works Theognis of Megara and the transitional conception of truth developed in them, which bears marks of both the bardic conception that preceded it and the concept of essence that followed it.</p> <p>In Part 3, I will turn to PSM itself and its relation to the changes described in the preceding section. First, I will offer an examination and critique of Richard Seaford’s account of the origins of PSM and its relation to the money form as a result of what he calls “unconscious cosmological projection.” Then, I will elucidate my own positive account of the origins and development of PSM in terms of its ideological function in response to the aristocratic and social crises of the Archaic period and the inability of its proponents to recognize the latent content of the money form as an externalization of the total social labor that posits both the equality of labor and its thoroughgoing interdependence.</p> <p>Finally, in Part 4 I will discuss the methodological, historical and practical implications of the preceding reconstruction, with an eye to the larger project set out in this introduction.</p> <p>There are also two appendices attached to this essay, the first of which details the methodological background that underlies the arguments presented in the body of the essay, and the second of which provides a more concrete reconstruction of the relevant historical developments that took place between the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces and the consolidation of the <em>poleis</em> in the Archaic. The second in particular is important for putting the developments discussed in Part 2 in their proper perspective and justifying a number of the claims made there.</p> <h2 id="1-the-problem-of-historical-reconstruction">1. The Problem of Historical Reconstruction</h2> <h3 id="marcuses-position-11">Marcuse’s Position (1.1)</h3> <p>My beginning this piece with an examination of Marcuse’s essay “The Concept of Essence” is in some sense a nod to the biographical origins of the investigation I am undertaking here. It was his essay that sent me down the path that culminated in the writing of the essay you are reading now. So, if you’ll allow me to be a little loose with my terms, beginning in this way can be seen as an attempt to leave somewhat ajar the doors of the hidden abode of production whose product stands before you in the form of a finished work; Or, in a more Hegelian vein, to lay bare the process of mediation without which the result would appear as a bare immediacy stripped of its full meaning and conceptual content. To properly elucidate the concepts developed here, the conceptual and methodological problems in Marcuse’s essay that served as their origin must themselves be taken back up into their exposition, and so I must begin with an account of Marcuse’s position. At the same time, it should be understood that the primary purpose of this essay is not the evaluation of that position, but rather the development of an account of the emergence of the concept of essence and its socio-historical determination, which, despite inheriting its object and certain animating problems from Marcuse’s account, rests on different principles, principles that could be said to represent the determinate negation of those that Marcuse’s essay is founded on. In this sense, Marcuse’s position is only a starting point, but it is nevertheless an essential starting point.</p> <p>At first glance, Marcuse’s essay has the appearance of offering a historical materialist account of the emergence and development of the concept of essence (and to some extent it does do so, as we’ll see below). It is framed as an attempt to show how “even [the] loftiest conceptions of philosophy are subject to historical development,” and how “so much of men’s real struggles and desires went into the metaphysical quest for an ultimate unity, truth, and universality of Being that they could not have failed to find expression in the derived forms of the philosophical tradition.”<d-footnote>Herbert Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," in _Negations: Essays in Critical Theory_, trans. Jeremy Shapiro (Mayfly Books, 2009), 31.</d-footnote> This suggests that the project Marcuse is pursuing is an attempt to demonstrate the validity of the basic historical materialist postulate that “it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_, trans. S.W. Ryazanskaya (Progress Publishers, 1977), Preface.</d-footnote> But, upon closer examination, this framing already reveals the deficiencies of his project from the perspective of a genuine, dialectical conception of historical materialism.</p> <p>The first way in which it does so is by restricting the scope of the socio-historical determination of thought. In order to account for the apparent invariance of the <em>content</em> of the concept of essence, which he glosses as “the abstraction and isolation of the one true Being from the constantly changing multiplicity of appearances,” Marcuse argues that it is the “<em>position and function</em> [of such concepts] within philosophical systems” [italics mine] that is subject to change.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 31.</d-footnote> It is therefore to the position and function of the concept of essence that we should look to understand its socio-historical determination. But, this division between an invariant content and a historically determined position and function already concedes too much to the idealist position Marcuse is trying to argue against, abstracting and isolating the content of the concept from the realm of historical explanation and positing it as an eternal, transcendent content whose origins are either obscure or unknowable.</p> <p>The obscurity of the origins of this transcendent content creates a number of problems for the beginning of Marcuse’s historical account. Without the ability to give a historical explanation of the origins of the content of the concept of essence, he is forced to posit its emergence as an external bringing-together of independently pre-existing determinations (or of the philosophical problems that underlie them).<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 32.</d-footnote> He argues that it is the bringing-together of the “epistemological” determinations of unity, universality and abstraction with the determination of truth—understood as distinguishing between hierarchically ordered levels of reality—that provides essence with its “critical and ethical elements” and so with its primary function within Plato’s philosophy, which is to establish a “critical gap” between what is and what could or should be.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33. As we shall see in Part 2, there is a notion of truth that pre-exists the emergence of the concept of essence, but it is not until that emergence occurs that it takes on the determination Marcuse attributes to it.</d-footnote> He doesn’t explain where these determinations, or the problems that form their “philosophical substratum,” themselves arise from, or why they are brought together to form the concept of essence, outside of some quasi-mystical and ultimately tautological talk of a “quest for the unity and universality of Being in view of the multiplicity and changeability of beings.”<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 32--3.</d-footnote> It is as if, for Marcuse, the Ancient Greeks already had a notion of essence preconceived in their heads before they went searching for it.</p> <p>If there <em>is</em> an invariance in certain elements of the concept of essence, or of any other metaphysical category—which does have a certain plausibility given a cursory look at the history of philosophy—then that invariance must itself be understood historically. First, it must be established (which it isn’t clear to me has been done, whether by Marcuse or anyone else), and then it must be traced to its roots in the socio-historical conditions of the various periods in which it can be observed, whether this means finding some common condition, or set of conditions, that explain its persistence, or providing an explanation of how a set of relatively contingent circumstances led to its maintenance under different modes of production despite lacking such a common basis.<d-footnote>I will suggest a few possibilities on this score below, such as that it is existence of social presuppositions of the process of production that underlies a certain continuity in the determination of truth, and the monetization of these presuppositions that does the same with continuities in the determination of essence, but these are provisional hypotheses derived from the concrete historical material, and requiring confirmation from further historical investigation, rather than theoretical or methodological assumptions brought to that material on the basis of high-level generalization.</d-footnote> Not only that, but the question of what exactly is invariant in that concept, if anything is, must remain open throughout the investigation. Whether it is actually the determinations of unity, universality, abstraction, and truth that form the invariant content of the concept of essence, or even whether it is in terms of content that the concept is invariant, are questions whose answers, like those to the question of invariance itself, cannot be assumed from the start but must be found, tested, modified, and retested in the material itself as the process of investigation proceeds.</p> <p>Additionally, this obscurity about origins begins to give us a sense of why there is no historical account of the social conditions of Classical Athens in Marcuse’s essay, despite his claim that that is where the concept of essence first emerged. The ahistorical nature of the content allows it to appear as a pure origination, one that seems to have been completely contingent and in no need of explanation. Still, even the supposedly ahistorical nature of the content does not fully explain the complete lack of socio-historical grounding that we are discussing. For example, one would expect the position and function of the Platonic concept of essence to still be subject to such grounding given Marcuse’s framing, but this is conspicuously absent from his exposition.</p> <p>The reason for this has to do with the deeper set of deficiencies revealed by Marcuse’s framing, which themselves have to do with the overall interpretive apparatus of the essay, which is over-reliant on “expressive causality” or homology and ultimately subsumes its historical materialist elements under an idealist philosophy of history.<d-footnote>For an overview of the Althusserian critique of expressive causality and the subsumption of it under the critique of homology, see Fredric Jameson, _The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act,_ (Cornell University Press, 1981), 23--43. For the general conception of allegory and interpretive levels on which this analysis is based, see Jameson, _The Political Unconscious,_ 29--32.</d-footnote> This appeared in the framing in terms of the <em>expression</em> of real human struggles and desires “in the derived forms of the philosophical tradition,” but its centrality to Marcuse’s analysis is demonstrated much more clearly by taking the interpretive apparatus as a whole as our object of examination. In this schema, the text of the history of philosophy is read on multiple levels, each of which can be categorized according to the primary philosophical methodology that is operative in it.</p> <p>We can call the first level quasi-Heideggerian because it is where the lingering influence of a Heideggerian problematic—recall that Marcuse was a student of Heidegger—is most prominent. It is also the level on which the bulk of the interpretation of Plato’s concept of essence is conducted. At this level, Marcuse reads Plato’s concept of essence according to an altered version of the Heideggerean conception of metaphysics in which the primarily question is of the relationship between Being and beings, a relationship that is made possible by a transcendence of the “facticity” of beings.<d-footnote></d-footnote><d-footnote>See Martin Heidegger, "What is Metaphysics?," ed. Dieter Thomä, trans. Ian Moore and Gregory Fried, _Philosophy Today_ 62, no. 3 (2018): 733--51, &lt;https://doi.org/10.5840/philtoday20181024232&gt;, for the conception of metaphysics referenced in this paragraph, especially 739--44. This focus on transcendence also explains the transcendent character of the "common content," which encompasses the key determinations that attach to Being in opposition to beings, and so must be subject to the transcendence that produces this division.</d-footnote> For Marcuse, this transcendence does not take place on the basis of the “nihilation of the nothing,” but instead on the basis of the “critical consciousness of bad facticity, of unrealized potentialities.”<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33. For the "nihilation of the nothing," see Heidegger, "What is Metaphysics?," 740.</d-footnote> How the badness of facticity or the awareness of those unrealized potentialities is established for consciousness is not clarified, but presumably it has something to do with the seemingly inherent “quest for the ultimate unity, universality and truth of Being” and the “struggles and desires” that went into it, which formed a part of the framing discussed above. This ungrounded connection of Being to “authenticity” or potentiality, to “what should and can be,” provides the interpretive code on the basis of which the changing function of the concept of essence in the other historical examples is understood, and on which the connection to the next two levels is established.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 33.</d-footnote></p> <p>We can call the second level the historical materialist level because it operates on the basis of the concept of the mode of production, although it does so according to an economically determined expressive causality that might incline us to label it “vulgar” historical materialism. This is the level at which the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence is read on the basis of changes to its position and function. It is this level of interpretation that generates the most interesting insights in the historical section of the essay, despite the limits of its expressive mechanism. In each case, changes in the function of the concept of essence are read first in terms of the division set up on the first level between bad facticity and potentiality, as embodying, distorting, displacing or eliminating the “critical gap” between them that was established in the the case of Plato, and then reread in terms of the homology between these changes and changes in the configuration of the forces and relations of production.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 34--7. For example, the positing of an absolute separation and externality between the two sides in the Medieval concept is understood as an expression of the relations of personal domination that characterized the feudal mode of production, and the subjectivization and displacement of the Cartesian concept of essence into the realm of logic and epistemology is understood as an expression of the individualization and (fetishized) subjection of those individuals to the conditions of production characteristic of the capitalist mode of production.</d-footnote> This order of operations also helps explain the lack of an account of the social determination of the Platonic concept of essence, which sets the baseline on which this second level of interpretation relies, and so falls outside of its purview.</p> <p>The third level can be labeled the quasi-Hegelian or idealist level because it operates on the basis of the concept of freedom, building on the readings of the previous two levels and rereading them in terms of freedom in order to construct a teleological metanarrative that resembles the Hegelian philosophy of history in its broad outlines. In this metanarrative, the “interest of freedom” is seen as the originating impulse and inner essence of the development of philosophy, and Marxism, or the “materialist doctrine of essence,” represents the culmination of that development insofar as it takes as its object the actualization of freedom—which has been made into a <em>real possibility</em> by the social conditions of the modern era.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 48--9, 56, and 60.</d-footnote> It is on this third level that the grounding of the connection between true Being and potentiality that was missing from the perspective of the first level takes place. We can now see that the “interest of freedom” is what establishes the badness of facticity and the conscious awareness of unrealized potentiality, and so makes possible the fundamental metaphysical division between Being and beings on which Marcuse’s interpretation of the concept of essence is based. It is able to do so because, as the origin and inner essence of the concept of essence, it is posited as implicitly containing the seeds of the whole development in-itself by the meta-narrative constructed through the interpretive apparatus. This determination by the interpretive apparatus further disincentivizes any investigation of the origins or socio-historical determination of the Platonic concept of essence because such investigation might disturb its function as a pure origin and inner essence of the development as a whole.</p> <p>It is the idealist philosophy of history constructed by the third level, and its subsumption of the historical materialist interpretation, based on the concept of the mode of production, under itself, that forms the most objectionable part of Marcuse’s overall position and causes the most distortion of both the historical material and the project of historical explanation itself. At the same time, even without that subsumption, Marcuse’s reliance on homology would have limited his ability to properly explain the socio-historical emergence and development of the concept of essence, even according to the determinations of the “materialist doctrine of essence” that he himself set out in the latter half of his essay.<d-footnote>Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence," 50--64.</d-footnote> In this latter section, he paints a more adequate picture of the principles of historical materialism, although they are still colored by their situation within the idealist and expressive interpretive frameworks of the overall exposition, and so they must be evaluated on a case by case basis as to their usefulness for our project.<d-footnote>See Appendix 1 for a discussion of some of the relevant principles.</d-footnote> Similarly the conclusions drawn must be called into question and reevaluated on the basis of concrete historical investigation.</p> <p>To avoid the problems that prevented Marcuse from developing an adequate account of the socio-historical determination of essence, our investigation must rest on a thoroughly different methodological foundation from his—one whose basic impulses arise from the determinate negation of the abstract transcendence, formalism and idealist philosophy of history that subsumed and restricted the historical materialist elements that gave Marcuse’s essay its original appeal. This means starting with the concrete socio-economic conditions themselves that gave rise to the concept of essence and any antecedents it may have had, rather than starting from presupposed conceptual determinations of that concept and interpreting them on the basis of a teleological metanarrative or philosophy of history.<d-footnote>My research has led me to locate this emergence not with Platonic theory of Forms, but with the substance monism of the early Pre-Socratic philosophers.</d-footnote> At the same time, it also means understanding those conditions in the context of a total social process centered around the mode(s) of production of concrete social formations and its transformation over time, and giving explanatory priority to the broadly economic elements that provide its foundation, while also respecting the relative autonomy of its various structural elements.<d-footnote>For a more detailed exposition of what I mean by the broadly economic and its foundational place in the overall mode of production, see Appendix 1.</d-footnote> Clearly, this remains an interpretive scheme. It could not be otherwise. But it is one that is not centered on the <em>expression</em> of the content of one level in the content of another level, or on the subordination of the whole interpretive apparatus under the determinative closure of a master code, but rather on the reciprocal determination of relatively autonomous elements. Finally, it involves an active and dynamic suspension of the presuppositions we all bring into historical interpretation in favor of a dialectical surrender to the object, but one which does not entail avoiding the responsibility of simultaneously <em>thinking</em> that object.<d-footnote>For more on this process of active surrender to the object, see Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, _Science of Logic,_ ed. and trans. George di Giovanni (Cambridge University Press, 2015), 37 (21.43) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, _Phenomenology of Spirit,_ trans. A.V. Miller (Oxford University Press, 2013), 3.</d-footnote> Taken together, these form the basic impulses that animate the conception of historical materialism I develop in this study. A more detailed elaboration of this conception can be found in Appendix 1, but, as Hegel reminds us, the true elaboration can only be found in the unfolding of the project as a whole.<d-footnote>Hegel, _Phenomenology of Spirit,_ 1--4.</d-footnote></p> <h3 id="sohn-rethel--historical-materialism-12">Sohn-Rethel &amp; Historical Materialism (1.2)</h3> <p>Another prominent Marxist figure who has attempted to address the social determination of Ancient Greek philosophy is Alfred Sohn-Rethel. In his book <em>Manual and Intellectual Labor</em> Sohn-Rethel, like Marcuse, attempts to construct a grand historical narrative that explains the origins of a central feature of bourgeois thought—this time the epistemological foundations of “scientific cognition” as a whole and trace it back to its socio-historical foundations, which he locates in the “exchange abstraction” and, more generally, in the division between manual and intellectual labor. Also like Marcuse, Sohn-Rethel does this in order to say something about the overcoming of capitalism, this time in terms of the overcoming of said division between manual and intellectual labor, rather than in terms of the realization of freedom. In examining the work of Sohn Rethel, we will find that it is plagued by many of the same problems as Marcuse’s attempt. Our old friends formalism, homology, transcendence and idealism will all rear their heads once again, although in enough of a different manner as to remain instructive. If nothing else, this examination will serve to differentiate the methodological principles at work in this essay and the questions it attempts to answer from those of a superficially similar, but fundamentally different project that it might be associated with.</p> <p>The first point to make about <em>Manual and Intellectual Labor</em> is that despite its historical materialist dressing, Sohn-Rethel’s project is completely enveloped by the Kantian problematic it takes as its object of critique. He starts by saying that he accepts Kant’s premise that “the principles of knowledge fundamental to the quantifying sciences cannot be traced to the physical and sensorial capacity of experience.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor: A Critique of Epistemology_, trans. Martin Sohn-\ Rethel (Haymarket Books, 2021), 31.</d-footnote> But, like many before him, he is unsatisfied with the way Kant grounds this division between the <em>a priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em> in the transcendental unity of apperception, which is itself presented as an ungrounded source of “transcendental spontaneity.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor_, 31--2.</d-footnote> He argues that the fault in Kant’s project lies in his unwillingness to pursue his inquiry to the point of locating a “historical origin of our logical ability to construct mathematical hypotheses and the elements contributing to them.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 31--2. This reduction of all the content of the Kantian a priori to a mathematical basis most likely rests on a common faulty interpretation of the role of math in Kant's system (one typically derived from a reading of Kant's analytic presentation of the apriority of space as the form of outer intuition in the _Prolegomena_ which ignores the synthetic presentation of the apriority of space in the _Critique_). For a critique of this interpretation see Lisa Shabel, "Kant's 'Argument from Geometry,' " _Journal of the History of Philosophy_ 42, no. 2 (2004): 195--215, &lt;https://doi.org/10.1353/hph.2004.0034&gt;. This reduction is characteristic of Sohn-Rethel's presentation, which almost exclusively focuses on the quantitative and mathematical elements of philosophical and scientific cognition, which allows him to reduce thought, or "abstract intellect", to a form more easily assimilable to the abstract quantitative determinations of the "exchange abstraction."</d-footnote> His project in <em>Intellectual and Manual Labor</em> is to show that this historical origin lies in the “exchange abstraction” which becomes “converted into the conceptual structure of the abstract intellect.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor_, 57.</d-footnote> In conceiving his project this way, Sohn-Rethel retains the Kantian conception of scientific cognition—which is a product of determinate circumstances corresponding to a specific phase of the capitalist mode of production (and of the development of science)—and reifies it as the transcendental structure of “abstract intellect” and scientific thinking in general. Without going into the details of the many distortions of Marx’s analysis of the commodity form that result from this, I think it is sufficient here to say that this leads him into a formalism that is similar to Marcuse’s insofar as his appropriation of both Marx and the historical evidence are always already structured by this presupposition.<d-footnote>Some telling examples of this are Sohn-Rethel's dismissal of value as having "no thought content of its own, no definable logical substance" and "bearing no inherent reference to labor" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 40--1), his dismissal of the importance of the landed aristocracy and overemphasis on the role of circulation as the primary source of wealth in Archaic and Classical Greece, along with his characterization of this circulatory wealth as "merchants and users capital" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 83 &amp; 85), and his claim that the exchange abstraction is founded on "social postulates" and thus the concepts derived from it are normative and able to assume an independent logical existence separated from "statements of fact" (Sohn-Rethel, _Intellectual and Manual Labor,_ 56--7). In all of these cases, the evidence drawn upon is distorted in order to strengthen the isomorphism between commodity exchange (and the societies in which it took place) and the Kantian structure of cognition as divided between _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ (and the capitalist relations of production under which it was formulated).</d-footnote></p> <p>In addition to the formalism of his ahistorical conception of abstract intellect, Sohn-Rethel’s Kantian problematic also leads him to to formulate his conception of “the exchange abstraction” and its “laws” or “formal structure” on the basis of its necessary conditions of possibility. At first, he attempts to give his derivation of the structuring concepts of abstract intellect a materialist veneer by arguing that they derive from the <em>act</em> of exchange in its opposition to the <em>act</em> of use. But, as Jameson reminds us, historical materialism “does not assert the primacy of matter so much as it insists on an ultimate determination by the mode of production,” a reminder which equally applies to activity abstracted from its mode of production as it does matter.<d-footnote>Jameson, _The Political Unconscious_, 45</d-footnote> It also gradually becomes clear that it is not the act of exchange itself so much as the “social postulates” or “fictions” that underlie the “exchange abstraction (such as the postulate that “no physical change should occur in the commodities” during the act of exchange) that provide the actual basis on which the concepts are derived and “converted” into philosophical concepts. These postulates are conceived as having nothing to do with “statements of fact,” but rather, “are norms which commodity exchange has to obey to be possible.”<d-footnote>For the elements of the exchange abstraction as social postulates and conditions of the possibility of the act of exchange, as well as their fictional character, see Sohn-Rethel, *Intellectual and Manual Labo*r, 56--7 and 45, respectively. He does seem to recognize the incompatibility of this idealist procedure with his purported materialism in places, such as when he tries to reground the postulate of exemption from material change in human action by saying that "changes caused by human beings which infringe this postulate are outlawed by the police authority presiding in the market," but it is unclear who or what this "police authority" is or whether it corresponds to an actual and invariant condition of commodity exchange, and so falls flat.</d-footnote> It should be clear to anyone who has read the first chapter of <em>Capital</em> that this has nothing to do with the form-analysis undertaken by Marx there, in which it is the <em>relationship</em> established between two commodities in the act of exchange—in which one commodity is posited as the material embodiment of the value of the other commodity, which is itself thereby posited as having a value independent of its own material body and qualitative existence—that posits value as an abstract determination of the commodity, not any social postulates that function as transcendental conditions of the possibility of that act.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, _Capital: A Critique of Political Economy_, vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes (Penguin, 1990), 139--54.</d-footnote> Once again, we see that it is the relationship of reciprocal determination in which elements stand with respect to each other that forms the basis of historical materialist explanation, rather than reliance on a transcendent(al) content determined by a necessity that stems from the presuppositions of the theorist.</p> <p>Neither does “the physical act of transfer,” which Sohn-Rethel puts forward as the pseudo-materialist base upon which these social postulates are supposed to operate, play any part in Marx’s analysis of the commodity form.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 23.</d-footnote> It is this pseudo-materialist base that is critical in enabling the “conversion” of the concepts derived from the social postulates into concepts of philosophical or scientific cognition that take nature as their object. Sohn-Rethel argues that it is through the operation of these postulates in the “physical act of transfer”, that “the negation of the natural and material physicality [of the act itself] constitutes the positive reality of the abstract social physicality of the exchange process,” which thereby constitutes “a kind of abstract nature.”<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 47</d-footnote> It is this combination of the abstraction derived from the social postulates and the physicality of the act of exchange that allows the “conversion” into philosophical-scientific concepts to happen and establishes the validity of these concepts in their reference to nature.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 58</d-footnote></p> <p>It is here that we can finally begin to understand the otherwise strange and highly idiosyncratic decision to ground the account of real abstraction in the act of exchange considered as physical transfer and the social postulates considered as necessary conditions of possibility—a conception that one would be hard pressed to derive from the works of Marx taken on their own. It is the typically Kantian concern with establishing the validity of the non-empirical concepts involved in mathematical and scientific cognition in relation to experience that best makes sense of the motivation for this decision.<d-footnote>Sohn-Rethel indicates the importance of this concern for his investigation in the sections on "Reification at the Root of the Intellect\" and "Laws of Nature"; Sohn-Rethel, _Manual and Intellectual Labor,_ 60--2*.*</d-footnote> Without it, there would be no reason to “supplement” Marx in the way Sohn-Rethel does by dividing the process of abstraction involved in exchange into an <em>a priori</em> portion that involves conditions of possibility and <em>a posteriori</em> portion that imparts it with its own (abstract) physicality.</p> <p>In order to avoid the formalism and dualism that Sohn-Rethel is led into by his Kantian problematic, in this essay I will be focusing not on the emergence of some transcendental structure or general mode of thinking (whether this be conceived in terms of “scientific thought,” “abstract intellect,” “philosophy,” or “rationality”), but rather on the emergence of a determinate concept, abstract substance, as it arises in the determinate circumstances in which it was developed, and insofar as it represents the first clear formulation of the opposition between being and an abstract substratum thought to posit it and constitute its truth—without assuming that this recognizability entails a continuity in with later formulations of essence in terms of its meaning or function. This means to bracket off those other questions, not because I don’t think there is anything to them—I suspect that there are actually multiple relatively independent processes taking place on different time scales, but do not discount the possibility of a significant and transformative convergence of some of these processes in Archaic and Classical Greece that corresponds with the purported object of the above theories—but because I don’t think approaching such a question in such broad strokes is productive for understanding the actual historical developments under consideration. It is only by paying attention to the intricate and particular details of historical processes, and situating them within the context of the total social process that they form moments of, and of the determinate mode(s) of production on the basis of which that process takes place, that these questions can be answered without running the risk of falling into the schematic and ahistorical kind of thinking that overtook Sohn-Rethel. Unlike Sohn-Rethel, I do not think that there is a singular key to unlocking the mysteries of the social determination of abstract thought, and so, to sail through the narrow passage between the Scylla of this kind of reductionism and the Charybdis of losing oneself in the immensity of the details, broader questions must be sacrificed (at least temporarily) in order to preserve the seaworthiness of our explanatory vessel.<d-footnote>This also means bracketing for the moment the question of Greek mathematics and its relation to both earlier mathematical traditions and philosophy, although I do think there is something distinctive about greek math and it does have something to do with the same processes that led to the emergence of Greek philosophy, with which it seems to be intertwined (at least biographically in the lives of the early philosophers). In terms of changes in the form of thought, it seems to me that the most fruitful angle from which to tackle this topic would involve investigating the development of the judgment and the syllogism as conceptual-linguistic forms. I hope to build off of the present study by pursuing both of these lines of inquiry in future pieces.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="2-the-pre-history-of-the-concept-of-essence">2. The Pre-History of the Concept of Essence</h2> <h3 id="bardic-truth-and-its-mode-of-production-21">Bardic Truth and its Mode of Production (2.1)</h3> <p>As we saw above, in order to understand the emergence of a recognizable concept of essence in Pre-Socratic Monism, we must situate it within the total social process that its development constituted a moment of.<d-footnote>For a more extensive discussion of what this means, see Appendix 1</d-footnote> This means looking back at its conceptual antecedents and the mode of production in which they were situated before moving on to the changes in that mode of production that conditioned the emergence of essence in the thought of the Pre-Socratics, which we will examine in section 2.2. In this section, I will content myself with a brief summary of the kind of society that existed in Greece at the earlier pole of this historical process, in order to then examine the mythico-poetic system of representation that corresponded to it. It was in this social and representational context that one of the primary determinations of essence identified by Marcuse, truth (<em>alētheia</em>), had been situated before changes in the mode of production led to its re-configuration into the form it would take in the concept of essence developed by the Pre-Socratic Monists.</p> <p>In the Homeric poems, we can see both poles of this process of development—despite the archaizing perspective of the bardic author. For now, our focus must be on the earlier pole, which was characterized by a mode of production in which commodity production and exchange were relatively marginal and slavery had not yet taken on the central place in the mode of exploitation that it would in the later period.<d-footnote>See Appendix 2, 260-266 for a more extensive discussion of the role of slavery in the two periods and a critique of Finley's conflation of them in _The World of Odysseus._</d-footnote> In the communities of this period, the class structure of society was instead centered on external appropriation of the surplus of other communities through warfare and raiding and the internal appropriation of surplus in the form of tribute on the basis of the role that warrior-aristocrats played in the necessary communal labors of religion and self-defense.<d-footnote>See Appendix 2, 253-260 for a more in depth look at the different elements of the mode of exploitation in these communities.</d-footnote> The most important point here is that within the community the mode of surplus appropriation was still, to some extent, based on the social role of the warrior aristocracy in the necessary surplus labor on which the survival of the community as a whole—and the independent production of the individual households that together constituted that community—depended. This is true not only of the martial activities that directly ensured the survival of the community, but also of the religious activities that cohered the community <em>as a community</em> and mediated the reproduction of the social relations of production through which the direct production of the means of life was carried out. In this sense, the warrior-aristocracy provided the unity of the community as such, and they did so on the basis of personal authority and a network of ritually institutionalized relationships, which guaranteed the sanctity of that authority through the supersensible power of the gods.<d-footnote>A possible explanation of why the authority that guaranteed the sanctity of the customs and rituals through which social relations were mediated took the form of supersensible or divine power is suggested by Marx in the section of the _Grundrisse_ on pre-capitalist social forms, where he says that in early communal forms of society, both the social and objective presuppositions of direct appropriation though the labor process "are not themselves the _product_ of labor, but appear as its natural or _divine_ presuppositions." Karl Marx, _Grundrisse: Foundations of the Critique of Political Economy (Rough Draft),_ trans. Martin Nicolaus (Penguin, 1993), 472. With this in mind, we can understand the need for divine authority to guarantee personal authority and the institutionalized relationships it was embedded in as a result of the fact that the social conditions of both (such as custom, kinship structures, common language etc) are _presuppositions_ that do not stem from the activity of the individuals that make up the living community themselves.</d-footnote></p> <p>The bard was another figure involved in this system of divine sanction, and it is in the religious structure of Homeric society that connects the bard and the warrior aristocrat—and in its mytho-poetic representation—that we can most clearly see the place of truth in Pre-Archaic Greek social formations, in which it had a different content and set of conceptual relations than it would come to have in PSM. The bard was seen as able to imbue action and speech with divine sanction, though of a particular type: the sanction of the Muses.<d-footnote>Marcel Detienne, _The Masters of Truth in Archaic Greece,_ trans. Janet Lloyd (Zone Books, 1999), 39--42.</d-footnote> The Muses were the divine personification of <em>mousa</em>, sung speech, which was connected with “laudatory speech”.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 40.</d-footnote> They were also portrayed as the daughters of Memory (<em>Mnēmosynē</em>) and, with their power to know “all things that were, things to come and things past,” they “claim[ed] the privilege of ‘speaking the truth.’ ”<d-footnote>Homer, _Iliad_, trans. Richmond Lattimore (University of Michigan Press, 1951), 1.70, quoted in Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 42--3; Hesiod, _Theogony_, trans. Richmond Lattimore (University of Michigan Press, 1951), 28, 32, and 38, quoted in Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 42--5.</d-footnote> Detienne argues that this sung speech allowed the bard to “enter into contact with the other world, and his memory granted him the power to ‘decipher the invisible.’ ”<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 43.</d-footnote> It is this contact with the invisible world, facilitated by divine, oracular memory, that allowed the bard, like the Muses, to speak truth, to confer divine sanction on his words of praise and blame, and the deeds they referred to, most importantly the deeds of the heroic warrior-aristocrat.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 45.</d-footnote> It is through the bard that the <em>kleos</em> (glory) of the warrior was thought to reach not just the ears of the community and future generations, but up to the heavens.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 46.</d-footnote> In this way the bard played a role in solidifying the divine sanction that ensures the social sanctity of the institutions centered around the warrior-aristocracy.</p> <p>Should we understand this social function of the bard, in which the truth of their statements was embedded, as merely an ideological support for the rule of the warrior-aristocrat? This was clearly one aspect of the bard’s function, but even it must be taken in the context of a social situation in which that rule was based on the role of the aristocrat in the necessary social labor that ensured the reproduction of the community. Furthermore, the bards themselves clearly played an independent role in that necessary labor insofar as their praise and blame, as well as the broader narrative context in which it was allocated, did not merely sanction the rule of warrior-aristocracy, but also preserved and transmitted the customs and broader cultural heritage through which social relations, both within a community and between communities in a broader network of alliance and obligation, were mediated. This is the function that secured their truth, that gave it its meaning, that vested it in them as bearers of that function, and that was expressed as an oracular connection with a divine world in which memory provides access equally to past, present, and future as elements of an atemporal ‘plane of truth.’</p> <p>At this point, it is useful to compare this mythico-religious conception of truth with the determination of truth as it would appear once it had become situated within the conceptual relations of PSM. In the latter, truth will have taken on the determination that Marcuse identifies with it of establishing a hierarchical relation between levels of reality in which one level is taken to be in some sense more “real” than another. It will also have assumed the connection to unity, universality, and abstraction that Marcuse posits as characteristic of the concept of essence. In the earlier bardic conception, despite significant continuities (which we will return to shortly) the overall determination of truth is different on both scores. On the first, while it is does appear to distinguish between two different levels of reality, and does do so to some extent—i.e. between the divine, atemporal “plane of truth” and the mortal realm—its real opposition is with oblivion (lēthē), and its function is primarily to distinguish, within the mortal realm, and through the action of divine memory, that which is to be preserved and elevated up to the undying realm of the gods from that which does not merit preservation and so will be forgotten and sink down into oblivion.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 47--52*.*</d-footnote> This is a different sorting process from the one involved in the truth of PSM, one that operates on the basis of moral categories (praiseworthiness, blameworthiness, glory, etc.) rather than the logical or metaphysical categories of the latter conception (unity, universality, abstraction). Even the “unseen world” that the truth of the bards provides access to is not seen so much as underlying the mortal world as being parallel to and in constant interaction with it.</p> <p>Still, the similarities are significant. Most importantly, bardic truth does posit a division between different planes of reality, one sensible and mortal, and the other supersensible and in some way atemporal. This atemporality has a certain ambivalence between the senses of <em>immortality</em> as that which does not die and <em>permanence</em> as that which is invariant or eternal. Both of these senses can be seen as related to the social function of the bard. The first relates to the distinctly personal and subjective aspects of this function. It is the mechanism of oral transmission and its characteristic objects (warrior-aristocrats and their words and deeds) that determine atemporality as immortality, as an elevation of particular elements of the concrete mortal world to a special status in which their temporal nature is not so much removed as infinitely extended by the memory of the bard and the act of preservation and transmission through the process of telling and retelling.<d-footnote>As a bad infinity, this process of telling and retelling cannot realize the immortality that it ascribes to its objects. Instead it must inscribe them within the perpetual ought of its own process of reproduction, the instability of which, along with its dependence on continuous reinscription within the living community, probably contributes to the porosity of the boundary between the "unseen world" and the mortal realm, although this is clearly also a product of the need to posit more active divine intervention to ensure the sanctity of ritually inscribed relations whose purely interpersonal basis would leave them relatively insecure.</d-footnote> The second sense is more properly atemporal, in that it indicates an exteriority to the flow of time, rather than merely being infinitely extended out into that flow. This is the sense that attaches to the plane of truth itself, in which past, present and future are seen as simultaneously accessible, and, in a sense, undifferentiated, or at least cut off from their temporal ordering. It is not the personal-subjective aspects of the bards function that underlie this second sense of atemporality—and so also the basic separation between the planes that lies at the heart of the determination of truth—but the social aspect, or the way in which the bard relates to the reproduction of the social totality, that does so.</p> <p>In preserving and transmitting the customs and broader cultural heritage in which the social relations of production and reproduction were embedded, the bard reproduces the necessary social <em>presuppositions</em> of the social formation. As presuppositions, these stand outside the sensuous activity of the community as conditions of communal production that are not themselves produced by the community. They thus stand outside the normal process of becoming that characterizes the everyday life of the community, and bring together past (as pre-existent), present (as conditions of the current existence of the living community) and future (as conditions of the continuing reproduction of the community) in their separation from that process. This can be seen as the foundation of the second sense of atemporality as being outside the flow of time, as well as of the basic separation between a sensuous and temporal plane of reality and a supersensuous and atemporal one on which the bardic conception of truth as a whole rests.</p> <p>Despite the otherwise general reconfiguration of the concept of truth in the time between the bardic conception and that of PSM, in which the interactive parallelism of the earlier conception became a foundational relationship based on logical-metaphysical rather than moral categories, the basic division on the basis of which the latter conception continued to be structured, between a sensible and temporal realm and a supersensible and atemporal one, can be seen to have already been present in the earlier conception. How should we explain this continuity? Given the basis of the earlier form of the division in the social function of the bard of reproducing the necessary presuppositions of the social formation as a whole, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the persistence of this division was based on the persistence of this social function and to posit that the changes in its organization have their basis in changes in the operation of that function. If we then look at the historical evidence, we do in fact find that this function both persists and undergoes significant change. As we shall see in more detail below, in the later period the impersonal institution of monetary exchange had come to replace the relational institutions of the earlier period as the primary form of social mediation on which the unity of the social formation as such was based, and so also it had itself become the primary social presupposition on which social production rested.<d-footnote>This is not to say that custom or religion stopped playing this function entirely---their continued existence attests to their continued functionality---but simply that they no longer occupied the primary position which they had in the earlier relations of production.</d-footnote> With this transformation, the bard, as a personal, subjective bearer of the function of reproducing this presupposition, was replaced by money itself as an objective bearer of that same function. Simultaneously, truth became detached from its connection to the social function of an individual with whose speech it was coextensive and began to take on the determinations of the money form, with its division between a concrete material embodiment and an abstract value underlying it, and its role as universal equivalent that provides unity to the diverse commodities related to it in terms of their value.</p> <p>As we shall see in the following sections, the emergence of essence in PSM and its relation to the money form is more complicated than this correspondence would suggest. For one, the objectification of the primary social presuppositions of the changing mode of production meant the dissolution of the direct relationship between speech and the social function of reproducing those presuppositions. It is this direct relationship that grounds the truth of bardic speech, and without it, any assertion of the continuing relevance of that social function to the determination of truth runs the risk of being reduced to mere homology. Relatedly, the correspondence on its own is unsatisfactory insofar as it does not explain why the objectification of the social preconditions of the process of production resulted in a transformation of the determination of truth rather than its abandonment as the social system in which it was embedded collapsed. In fact, there is a divergent intellectual tendency among the Greek aristocracy that did abandon the concept of truth after the collapse of the social conditions of its mytho-religious formulation—the intellectual lineage leading from Simonides of Ceos down to the sophists and beyond.<d-footnote>For the relation between Simonedes and the Sophists, see Detienne, _Masters of Truth,_ 107--19.</d-footnote> At the same time, the early philosophers, in whose thought the concept of essence emerged, did maintain a degree of continuity with the older conception of truth, and it was precisely on the grounds of the correspondence under discussion here that they did so. This continuity of the correspondence is indicative, and can direct us in the right direction, but it cannot be taken as an explanation on its own. The questions now are why the early philosophers maintained this continuity, and in what ways (and to what extent) were the continuities and differences in their conception of truth determined by the objectification discussed here. To answer these questions, we must turn to the historical context in which both this objectification and the emergence of the concept of essence took place.</p> <h3 id="the-crisis-of-aristocracy-22">The Crisis of Aristocracy (2.2)</h3> <p>Filling out the tapestry whose warp has been laid out above means turning to the transformations wrought by commercialization, military reform and the consolidation of a slave mode of production in the development of Greek social formations between the Early Iron Age and the Archaic Period.<d-footnote>The periodization scheme I am using here is based on the one in Alex Knodell, _Societies in Transition in Early Greece: An Archeological History_ (University of California Press, 2021), 7.</d-footnote> The reciprocal dynamic between commercialization and the changing mode of exploitation played out over a number of centuries, and culminated in 1) the crystallization of the money form out of the process of exchange and 2) consolidation of the mode of exploitation around private appropriation by a landowning aristocracy of the surplus produced by unfree labor.<d-footnote>For the concept of unfree labor in Ancient Greece, see G.E.M. De Ste. Croix, _The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World: from the Archaic Age to the Arab Conquests_ (Cornell University Press, 1981), 133--74.</d-footnote> This process of development is explored in further detail in Appendix 2. For now, suffice it to say that around the 7th century BCE, these processes had reached a critical point in which their effects, especially those of monetization, began to ripple out into society broadly and at an increasing pace, which was then further accelerated by the invention of coinage.<d-footnote>On this last point, see Richard Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy_ (Cambridge University Press, 2004).</d-footnote> It is these effects which characterize to a large extent the profound crises and transformations of the Archaic period, including the development of Pre-Socratic monism.</p> <p>Even the most noted change of this period, the development of the <em>polis</em>, can be seen to be a result of this process of commoditization and monetization. In Appendix 2, I describe how the centers of concentrated settlement that would develop into the first <em>poleis</em> were themselves nodes of long distance trade and the expanding commodity relations that accompany it, as well as the role of this commercial expansion in the centering of slavery within the primary process of production. The <em>polis</em>, as an urban area that incorporated its surrounding countryside, on which it was dependent for subsistence, was made possible by these same developments.</p> <p>That the typical <em>polis</em> was centered around its <em>agora</em>, or marketplace, is indicative, but even more decisive is the composition of the <em>poleis,</em> or more specifically, of the <em>astē.</em> Their primary residents were 1) aristocrats enabled to live away from their land holdings by the surplus labor extracted from slaves, serfs, or debt bondsman 2) craftsmen whose livelihoods were primarily dependent on selling commodities to those aristocrats in exchange for the products of that same surplus labor, and 3) the urban poor who begged or sold their labor-power to the aristocrats or to the <em>polis</em> itself for a wage.<d-footnote>See De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 114--33, 208--26, 269--78; Moses Finley, _The Ancient Economy,_ Updated Edition (University of California Press, 1999), 123--49. It is the combination of De Ste. Croix's characterization of these groups and emphasis on the importance of unfree labor in the mode of exploitation with Finley's emphasis on the consumptive nature of ancient cities and the importance of the landed aristocracy in that consumption that best allows us to see this point.</d-footnote> In a <em>polis</em> like Athens, even the funding of public institutions was derived in large part from the dedications, <em>eisphorai</em> and <em>liturgoi</em> of the aristocrats, in other words from the proceeds of selling the products of the surplus labor appropriated on their estates as commodities (and, even in the earliest cases of temple dedications, these products were exchanged for (often mass produced) objects made of metal).<d-footnote>For the _eisphorai_ and _liturgoi_, see Michael Gagarin, _Democratic Law in Classical Athens_ (University of Texas Press, 2020), Chapter 1, Kindle. For the mass production of temple dedications, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 102--9.</d-footnote> In this sense, the <em>polis</em> as a whole was a social form mediated by monetized impersonal relations. The city itself, the <em>astu</em>, which formed the center of the <em>polis</em> and gave it its unity, was determined as a site of commodity production, exchange, and consumption above all else. Its development was to a large extent a result of the increasing interdependence brought on by the increasing division of labor that arose and expanded along with the expansion of commodity production and exchange, but it was equally made possible by the changes in the mode of exploitation that accompanied this commercialization, which centered the private exploitation of unfree labor on the estates of aristocratic landowners as the primary mode of surplus appropriation on which the subsistence of the aristocracy—and the existence of the broader social formation as such—was based.</p> <p>In contrast to the personal authority that gave unity to the earlier social formations discussed above, and the institutions of personal reciprocity that mediated social relations within and between them, the monetized exchange relations that formed the primary basis of social mediation within the polis were impersonal and given objective unity by money itself as the universal embodiment of commodity-producing human labor. As the universal equivalent, money is separated off from the diverse mass of commodities as the material body in which each and all of them represent their value. It homogenizes the diverse particular forms of human activity whose products it is exchanged for. When a commodity producer exchanges their product for money, they exchange it for the embodiment of human labor in the abstract, for a commodity that has the exclusive function of representing the value of all other commodities. In this act of exchange, they posit their concrete, particular, private labor as abstract, universal, social labor. To the extent that a member of society produces commodities that they exchange for money, they posit their labor as social and qualitatively equal with all the other particular forms of labor that express their values in money. They posit their own labor as a fraction of the total social labor, but at the same time as social only insofar as it is exchanged for money, that is to say only indirectly. In this way the money form privatizes at the same time as it socializes, obscuring the social character of the productive activity of the members of society by embodying it as an external object, and one which can be possessed by an individual.</p> <p>This means that social mediation lost its interpersonal basis to the extent that it became monetized. If a man had money, he didn’t need a patronymic and lineage, nor loyalty, nor customary obligation, nor reputation, nor martial prowess to exercise social power or accumulate its trappings; he could pay for whatever product of the labor of others he wanted or needed and they wouldn’t ask who he was or why he wanted it, so long as they received money in return. To command an army no longer required one to inhabit a defined place in a hierarchy of privileges and obligations defined by honor and heredity but merely to have enough money to pay mercenaries to do your bidding, and this is how many Tyrants usurped power in the Archaic period and beyond.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 279--83*.*</d-footnote> As I noted at the end of the last section, it also meant that the formerly customary and interpersonal social presuppositions of the production and reproduction of the community became increasingly objectified in money itself, which gave unity to the now increasingly indirect and increasingly complex sociality of the different labors involved in the production and reproduction of the social formation as such.</p> <p>These developments resulted in a series of acute social crises that spread out across the Greek Mediterranean as the traditional social forms that undergirded the personal authority and class cohesion of the warrior-aristocracy were undermined. These crises began as crises of the warrior-aristocracy in the face of changing social conditions that then turned into general social crises—to a large extent as a result of the aristocratic responses to those very conditions. We already see this state of crisis expressed in the Homeric epics, both of which revolve around crises of aristocratic reciprocity and the institutions that mediated it.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 44.</d-footnote> It is these institutions themselves and the aristocratic ideals associated with them that explicitly frame the crises that animate the poems. The greed of Agamemnon and the Suitors can be seen as results of the new incentives for accumulation that accompany commercialization and that now outweighed the traditional imperatives for the leader to make a fair distribution or the guests to respect the hospitality of their host. Inversely, the refusal of Achilles to accept anything in exchange for his honor shows the unsuitability of the heroic ideal to the developing forms of social mediation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 38.</d-footnote> Finally, although there are other examples that could be given, the need for divine intervention to prevent the spiraling out of retribution and blood feud as a result of Odysseus’ decidedly heroic and honorable killing of the suitors shows the unsustainability of such forms of retribution in an increasingly (commercially) integrated society that had increasingly little place for the interpersonal violence that surrounded the warrior-aristocrat and which in many ways constituted his distinguishing feature.<d-footnote>This divine intervention is also indicative insofar as it is the gods, those supreme guarantors of aristocratic rule and superiority, who the poet ultimately relies on to resolve the seemingly insoluble contradictions arising from the system of honor and retribution in the mortal world.</d-footnote></p> <p>The Homeric response to the crisis laid out in the poems is characteristic of the overall aristocratic response to crisis in its tendency to lionize the outmoded institutions and values that previously upheld and legitimized aristocratic rule while ignoring or degrading the elements of change that undercut its viability. In a sense the aristocracy as a class acted in similar fashion to Achilles or Odysseus, obstinately trying to hold on to their honor, to the system of values and institutions in which their power and their way of life were embedded, in the face of a reality that ensured that this attempt would lead them to ruin. This impulse to double down on the traditional ideals and modes of conduct in the face of changing circumstances is part of what spelled trouble for the hereditary aristocracy in the context of a social world in which the development of commodity relations had created more integrated social formations with new incentives for accumulation of individual wealth, and possibly had also reduced the tolerance of the lower classes, especially the upper strata of these lower classes, for being treated as targets of appropriation rather than partners to an equal exchange.<d-footnote>Cf. Marx, _Capital, vol. I,_ 178*.* Aristotle also gives an example of this dynamic in the _Politics,_ when he describes the way the ruling family of the hereditary aristocracy of Mytilene, the Penthilidae, used to go around beating people over the head with clubs, until they were attacked in turn by a certain Megacles who took offense to this behavior. Aristotle, _Politics,_ in _The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation_, vol. 2, ed. Jonathan Barnes (Princeton University Press, 2014), 2082.</d-footnote></p> <p>The fuller extent of this dynamic comes into view when we look at what we know of the early laws of Athens and the circumstances that gave birth to them. The homicide law of Drako is clearly a response to the untenability of inter-elite blood feuds and the general impression we have of the seventh century BCE is that it was riven by crises arising from this kind of violent inter-elite strife within the hereditary aristocracy and between them and newer claimants to wealth and power.<d-footnote>See, e.g., Federica Carugati, "Athens Before the Crisis," in _Creating a Constitution: Law, Democracy and Growth in Ancient Athens_ (Princeton University Press, 2019), 23--4. Solon too can be seen to be concerned not so much with supporting the lower classes as with curbing those aristocratic practices which threatened the stability of the community as such, as argued by Harris in Edward M. Harris, "A Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" in _The Development of the Polis in Archaic Greece_, ed. Lynette G. Mitchell and P.J. Rhodes (Routledge, 1997), 111.</d-footnote> It is also clear from the laws of Solon and his description of the crisis that prompted his intervention that this kind of inter-elite conflict had broadened out into a general breakdown of social order in which the type of raiding we saw as a key part of the surplus appropriation of the old warrior-aristocracy became common <em>within</em> the <em>polis,</em> leading to the enslavement of citizens and accelerating the impoverishment of the small peasants and their growing indebtedness.<d-footnote>Harris, "A New Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" 106.</d-footnote> We should see this internal breakout of violent appropriation of land, people and goods as the one of the final obstinate spasms of the declining warrior-aristocracy in the face of their changing circumstances. Indeed, the Solonian legislation was the first in a series of upheavals and constitutional changes that registered and expanded the power of the <em>demos</em>, the lower classes, and laid the foundations for democracy.</p> <p>At the same time, this violent spasm was not just the death rattle of an old form of aristocracy, it was also the final labor pang in the birth of a new form. One of its most significant functions was to allow the consolidation of land in the hands of the aristocrats through direct violence, debt and the exercise of political power, thereby establishing the basis of their continuing supremacy within the emerging relations of exploitation.</p> <p>Solon’s laws also abolished the <em>hektemoroi</em>, the situation in which a portion of the population had to pay one-sixth part of their product to others. Harris argues that this did not represent the abolition of debt or the ending of a type of serfdom, as has been traditionally argued, but rather the prohibition of tribute payments like those seen in the Homeric epics, but which had become formalized into a system of fixed payments.<d-footnote>Harris, "A New Solution to the Riddle of the _Seisachtheia,_" 103--11</d-footnote> If this is correct, then it would represent an even more explicit sweeping away of the last vestiges of the traditional mode of exploitation of the warrior-aristocracy. Whether this represents the abolition of debt, the ending of a serf-like system or the abolition of tribute payments, it—coupled with the concentration of landed property in aristocratic hands, the increased legal protections and expansion of the scope of the courts, and the ban on enslavement of Athenian citizens—would have cleared the way for the consolidation of the mode of production around the commercialized polis—where dispossessed peasants would have had to have gone and become artisans, beggars or hired laborers (outcomes encouraged by other elements of the laws attributed to Solon, such as banning the export of grain and requiring fathers to teach their sons a trade)—on the basis of the aristocratic exploitation of slave labor on large landed estates in the countryside.<d-footnote>On the other Solonian Laws, see Carugati, "Athens Before the Crisis," 24.</d-footnote></p> <p>It is also worth noting in connection with this that Solon made wealth—defined by agricultural output—the primary criteria for political participation, which likely expanded the base of that participation to certain upper-middle strata who had previously been excluded, even if the distinctions between the ‘classes’ were fairly fine and all referred to owners of substantial amounts of property, as Osborne argues.<d-footnote>Robin Osborne, _Greece in the Making: 1200--497 BC,_ 2nd ed. (Routledge, 2009), 208.</d-footnote> With these changes—already developing before the Solonian reforms and continuing to be given further definition after, but for which the Solonian crisis and its purported solution represented a decisive shift—we see how the death throes of the old warrior-aristocracy, and the aristocratic reaction against them, led to their transformation into an aristocracy defined by ownership of the primary means of production (land) and the exploitation of slave labor.</p> <p>Across the Greek Mediterranean, the primary agents in the overthrow of the old aristocratic political order were a series of figures known as tyrants (among whom some count Solon himself, although he was somewhat unusual in being appointed to resolve the civil strife in Athens rather than seizing power by force). The tyrants were not just agents but also expressions of the crisis of aristocracy—and of the class struggle that it was enmeshed with. They often rose to power using the new means made available to them by the process of commercialization and the conflict generated by the exhaustion of traditional modes of aristocratic power. They played aristocratic factions and clans off each other, took up the causes of the burgeoning middle strata of medium sized landowners and larger landowners excluded from the hereditary aristocracy’s monopoly on political power (some of whom probably derived their wealth from commercial activities before using it to buy land), played on the discontent among the lower strata of small and dispossessed peasants, hired mercenaries to back their coups, and bought off important people and segments of the population either directly or through public expenditure. Many of these means were based directly on money as a new impersonal form of social power that could be accumulated by an individual and used to purchase things (status, good will, military forces) traditionally reserved for those who had personal authority issuing from their place in a system of defined social roles and obligations. Others were based on the conditions of class struggle associated with large-scale shifts in social relations produced by both commercialization and the consolidation of a slave mode of production. It was these conditions that were decisive for the tyrants writ large and that defined their overall historical role in breaking the political control of the hereditary warrior-aristocracy and expanding the class base of political participation.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World,_ 279--83.</d-footnote></p> <p>Along with commercialization, changes in the mode of exploitation, and the class struggle that accompanied these, the final major factor that drove the crisis of aristocracy in the Archaic was a shift in the organization and conduct of warfare known as the Hoplite Revolution. Though the orthodox position that a revolution in the conduct of warfare—in which the adoption of the hoplite panoply and phalanx tactics led to the increasing importance of a middling stratum of independent farmers in the composition of Greek armies starting in the 7th century BCE, and, as a result, to the increasing political and social power of this middling stratum—remains controversial, and continues to be challenged in many of its details, Hanson persuasively argues that it holds up in its broad strokes.<d-footnote>Victor Davis Kagan, "The Hoplite Narrative," in _Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece,_ ed. Donald Kagan and Gregory F. Viggiano (Princeton University Press, 2013), 256--70.</d-footnote> This “revolution” would have displaced the traditional warrior-aristocracy from its central position in the necessary communal labor of warfare, thereby further undermining the traditional base of their position within the class structure of their social formations and so of the legitimacy of their rule. Combined with the other factors discussed above, this represented a complete break with the former social relations that had upheld the warrior-aristocracy as a class and erosion of the basis for their own self-conception. It created a crisis in which the very definition of aristocracy was called into question at the same time as the aristocrats found themselves increasingly embattled with challenges to their position from below. In a certain sense, the erosion of the religious and military basis of their previous mode of exploitation left them with little justification for their rule and position in society aside from bare exploitation itself, which would’ve provided little ideological support in the face of challenges from the tyrants and demands for increasing rights and privileges from the rising middle strata and the lower classes that often formed the broader social base of their struggles. Add to this the fact that attempts to cling to the old ways were actively creating dysfunction and only increasing the strife, and it is clear that an ideological shift needed to take place, both in terms of legitimation and practical orientation, in order for the aristocracy to re-consolidate itself and its place in the fledgling relations of production that were arising around it.</p> <p>It is in the context of this need that we should understand the development and spread of Pre-Socratic Monism and the concept of essence which emerged within it. But, before turning to PSM itself, it is useful to look at the writings of Theognis of Megara, in which we can see evidence of the shifting aristocratic response to this crisis and the changes it brought to the determination of truth even before development of PSM.</p> <h3 id="theognis-a-transitional-conception-of-truth-23">Theognis: A Transitional Conception of Truth (2.3)</h3> <p>The poems attributed to Theognis are thought to have been written sometime between 650 and 550 BCE, thus firmly within the early period of the acute crisis of aristocracy that I have been discussing, but slightly before (or contemporaneous with) the first thinkers of PSM. In them, the poet bemoans the state of affairs in his polis, where, “this city is a city still, but lo! her people are other men, who of old knew neither judgments nor laws, but wore goatskins to pieces about their sides, and had their pasture like deer without this city; and now they be good men, O son of Polypaus, and they that were high be now of low estate.”<d-footnote>Theognis, "The Elegiac Poems of Theognis," in _Elegy and Iambus,_ vol. 1, Perseus Digital Library, 53--60.</d-footnote> These new men from the countryside, who the poet feels has usurped the place of his aristocratic peers, are distinguished throughout the poems by their attaining their position as a result of wealth (<em>ploutos)</em> rather than by being of good stock. The other oppositions that structure the poems are between truth—both as honesty and reality—and deception (or falsity), and between the good and the bad. These oppositions are structured in such a way that truth is aligned with good stock (heredity) and falsity/deception with wealth, while the good and the bad stand in an ambiguous and reversible position with respect to the others as a result of the falsity and deception generated by wealth. It is anxiety over the difficulty involved in distinguishing the <em>truly</em> good, which is aligned with heredity, but under the corrupting influence of wealth requires supplemental qualities to distinguish it—qualities like intelligence/judgment (<em>gnōmē</em>), power (<em>dynamis</em>, which still has its bodily/martial strength connotations, but has taken on a sense of authority/influence that is probably more operative here<em>)</em>, and moderation or self control—from the mere appearance of goodness created by wealth.<d-footnote>Moderation or self-control are most directly expressed in terms of taking the _messēn hodon_, the middle road or being _mesos_, in the middle.</d-footnote> At the same time, despite the identification of wealth with corruption, this process of discernment is explicitly aligned with the discernment of legitimate currency from counterfeit, which is used as a model for the difference between outward appearance (<em>ideai)</em> and a true, inner content (such as a person’s mind or heart).<d-footnote>Theognis, "The Elegiac Poems of Theognis," 119--28.</d-footnote></p> <p>The first thing to note here is that unlike in the Homeric picture of the crisis that we discussed above, the commercial origins of the more acute crisis faced by Theognis can no longer be omitted or downplayed. At the same time, the effects of commercialization—represented here by wealth (the abstract expression of which is almost certainly a sign of its monetization)—can still be, and constantly are, denigrated and disavowed. This shows a certain continuity in the aristocratic response to commercialization and its effects—despite the shift in emphasis from omission and downplaying to denigration and disavowal, and despite the explicit foregrounding of (the bearers of) monetized wealth as the cause of the crisis.</p> <p>The second is that heredity has become the defining feature of aristocracy rather than honor or martial prowess, despite the supplemental quality power (authority/influence) preserving some residue of the origins of the former in the latter. On the other hand, the other two supplemental qualities represent newer values that were absent in the Homeric portrayal of the warrior-aristocrat (although we might see a precursor to the foregrounding of judgment in the craftiness of Odysseus), ones determined by the crisis and changing material basis of aristocracy itself. It is telling in this respect that one of the primary meanings of judgment within the poems seems to be the ability to correctly discern who and what is truly good in the face of the deceptive appearances generated by wealth, which is to say that judgment, as a definitional attribute of true aristocracy entails to a large extent the very ability to distinguish the aristocratic from the common. In this sense we could say that in Theognis, the aristocratic value system that upheld the legitimacy of the Homeric warrior-aristocrat has been evacuated of much of its concrete meaning and reduced to a bare status distinction the primary determination of which—heredity—is not substantial enough to clearly delineate it in the eyes of even its defenders.</p> <p>The third thing of note is that the conception of truth put forward here represents a sort of intermediate conception between the mytho-religious and philosophical conceptions discussed above in relation to bardic truth. In Theognis, truth had not yet taken on its relationship to the metaphysical categories of unity, universality, and abstraction that it would in the concept of essence. Its sorting process still operated on the basis of moral criteria (albeit new moral criteria) and took people, words, and deeds as its characteristic objects. It was concerned with separating the good (aristocratic) person—or their actions, words or intentions—from the bad, though this had already become a process that functioned on the basis of a split between hierarchically ordered levels of reality, between sensible outward appearances and an imperceptible true content seen to underlies them.<d-footnote>The modeling of this separation on the difference between either the exchange value of a commodity and its use-value, or between the material body of gold and silver and their value---which underlie the ability to counterfeit, or to find that the money you exchanged for was not actually equal to the value of the commodities exchanged for it---is already suggestive of the influence of money on this reconfiguration.</d-footnote> It also still maintained a connection between truth and the social position of its bearer, although the privileged position had shifted from that of the bard to that of the aristocrat himself. On the whole, it is a conception of truth that appears relatively confused and empty of content. The possibility of accessing the truth underlying an appearance seems uncertain, as do the criteria on which the distinction between the true and the deceptive should be based. Even the criteria that are put forward are either themselves unstable and insufficient, like heredity, or relatively empty and circular, like judgment. In this sense, Theognis’ conception of truth gives voice to a problem that it does not have the conceptual resources to address, or even formulate clearly.</p> <p>At the end of Part 1, I argued that the transition from the bardic conception of truth to that of PSM was a result of the objectification of the function of reproducing the primary social presuppositions that underlie the existence of the social formation as a whole. Theognis lived in a social formation in which this objectification was relatively incomplete and it is on that basis that we can understand the incompleteness of his conception of truth. This incomplete objectification had proceed to the point where the individual-subjective aspects of the social function of the bard had been supplanted, but the generalization of monetary mediation had not yet reached the point that it would after the introduction of coinage, and so the position of money as the primary presupposition of the social totality had not been fully solidified.<d-footnote>For a similar, though ultimately divergent, account of this objectification and the role of coinage in it using different terminology, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote></p> <p>It is also in this light that we should see the inaccessibility of truth in Theognis, as well as the relative diminishment of the importance of atemporality in his conception of it. It is because the social function of the bard had broken down and the reproduction of the social presuppositions had not yet found a stable bearer in money that the status of the truth, which had previously been grounded in that function, became uncertain<d-footnote>Clearly it is not just the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social totality that had become uncertain in this period, but the reproduction of the social totality as a whole, as evidenced by the consistent civil strife discussed above.</d-footnote>. Without such stable presuppositions, the sense of atemporality that derived from their role <em>as presuppositions</em> faded away, and although there was still a differentiation between sensible appearance and a supersensible content underlying it present, there was not a strong sense that this was accompanied by the corresponding temporal-atemporal distinction that was attached to it in both the preceding and succeeding conceptions. Even the sense that these are distinct planes of reality has now become confused; it is dirempted between the flattening entailed by it being a person’s heart or mind that serves as the object of the truth-appearance distinction and the heightening of the distinction to the point of separation implied in the anxiety over whether truth can be apprehended at all.</p> <p>Additionally, the opposition between the material body of money and its value had not been brought out into the full clarity that it would achieve after the introduction of coinage. In the distinction between legitimate and counterfeit coinage that undergirds Theognis’ conception of truth, it is the material body of money (its weight, purity, etc.) that distinguishes the true from the false, whereas, with the introduction of coinage, the heightened visibility of the difference between a coins value and the value of the metal it is coined from will reverse this relation—making it the abstract value rather than the material body of money that takes precedence—and thereby facilitate the transition to a conception of truth centered around the determinations of money as the embodiment of value, i.e. unity, universality and abstraction.</p> <p>It is the combination of both of these factors—the incomplete objectification of the primary social presuppositions and the underdevelopment of the opposition between use-value and value—that explains the peculiarities of Theognis conception of truth, especially the incompleteness and problematic character of it that led us to see it as intermediate or transitional. In the poems of Theognis a new conception of truth began to emerge from the husk of the old, just as in his social situation a new mode of production was being born from the crisis of the preceding forms. It is only with the consolidation of this new mode, whose fundamental moments were monetary mediation and the exploitation of slave labor, that the fledgling determination of truth glimpsed in his works was able to develop into the fully-fledged concept of essence that characterized the thought of the Pre-Socratic Monists.</p> <p>As we shall see in Part 3, this did not happen of its own accord—a brute movement of the economic base that resounded through the superstructure and can be interpreted on the basis of homology. It was rather a reciprocal process in which certain conceptions were taken up and developed by certain (class-determined) subjects in response to the economic and social transformations facing them and on the basis of the functionality of those conceptions for those subjects within the class struggle that situated them, and, perhaps, on an inability on the part of those subjects to recognize the true content of the value form.</p> <h2 id="3-pre-socratic-monism">3. Pre-Socratic Monism</h2> <h3 id="money--pre-socratic-monism-31">Money &amp; Pre-Socratic Monism (3.1)</h3> <p>It is now time to turn to the emergence of the concept of essence itself and begin to build an account of its socio-historical determination. In this section, I will build off of Richard Seaford’s account of the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic Monism in <em>Money and the Early Greek Mind</em> in order to establish a baseline conception of this relation. Then, in the next section, I will provide a critique of Seaford’s account, showing how it runs into many of the same pitfalls that we saw earlier in Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel. This critique will provide a basis for developing my own positive conception of this relationship and its broader socio-historical determination in the third section. There, I will argue that it is only by understanding the determination of the concept of abstract substance developed in PSM in terms of its <em>function</em> as part of an aristocratic ideological project in response to the crisis outlined above that we can explain it adequately.</p> <p>The great merit of Seaford’s analysis of the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic thought, and what sets him apart from Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel, is the attention he pays to the concrete conditions in which this relationship developed. In part, this attention to the concrete is probably a product of general intellectual orientation and training as a classicist, but it is also a result of his delimitation of his object of investigation to what he identifies as the emergence of a specifically metaphysical content in the thought of the Pre-Socratics.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175. See especially n. 2.</d-footnote> He describes this metaphysical content as “the counter-intuitive idea of a single substance underlying the plurality of things manifest to the senses,” which allows the Pre-Socratics to develop an “idea of the universe as an <em>intelligible order</em> subject to the <em>uniformity</em> of <em>impersonal</em> power,” and is distinguished as metaphysical by the “concern with reality as opposed to appearance, with what is fundamental as opposed to what is derivative, and with comprehensive as opposed to partial understanding.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 175.</d-footnote> Despite the inclusion in his description of broader cosmological considerations, concern with comprehensiveness, and the genesis of metaphysics as a discourse, all of which fall outside the scope of our own investigation (without therefore being dismissed as legitimate considerations), it is clear that the central determinations of this content are the same ones we have been describing as those of the concept of essence: unity, universality, abstraction and truth.</p> <p>The most important consequence of the concreteness enabled by this delimitation is that Seaford, unlike Marcuse or Sohn-Rethel, is able to offer an explanation of why the emergence of the concept of essence occurred at the specific time and in the specific places that it did. His answer to these questions will ultimately turn out to be incomplete, but they provide us with many of the building blocks out of which my own explanation will be built. For Seaford, the most important of these changes is the introduction of coinage, which both leads to an intensification of the pace and extent of monetization and to a development of the opposition between use-value and value inherent in money.<d-footnote>For the first, see especially, Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 126--9, 134--6, and 198--209; For the second, see Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 171.</d-footnote> He does a thorough job of demonstrating that these are the primary terms in which the social formations in which PSM emerged and developed can be differentiated from the others in which it did not.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175--89, 198--200, 209--10, and 244, n. 75.</d-footnote> As a result of this, we have a plausible case for identifying the rapid monetization and development of the opposition between use-value and value that followed the introduction of coinage as decisive conditions of the emergence and development of PSM, even if we can’t yet specify how this relationship was established.</p> <p>Seaford also further specifies the significance of these two factors to the development of PSM and its central concept of abstract substance in ways that align with our exposition at the end of Part 2. He argues that rapid monetization results in what he calls the “social transcendence” of “monetary value” which he aligns with the “integrative power” of money, that explains the impersonal cosmology of the Pre-Socratics.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote> Furthermore, it is the fetishism of the commodity, in which social relations become embodied in an external <em>thing</em>, a thing on which “individual autonomy and prosperity and collective cohesion and prosperity seem to depend,” that Seaford sees as the ground of the “unconscious cosmological projection” of the money form into the thought determinations of PSM (on which more below).<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 209.</d-footnote> All this points to the complete objectification of the function of reproducing the social presuppositions of the social formation as a whole that we highlighted as still missing in our analysis of the Theognis’ transitional form of truth above. It is the generalization of monetary mediation as result of the introduction of coinage that allows this objectification to be completed. Once it is, we find that truth too has achieved a stable form in the concept of abstract substance, in which the hierarchical ordering of levels of reality has become attached to the determinations of unity, universality and abstraction, which are themselves determinations of the money form and the abstract value it embodies. It has also begun to regain the sense of distinction between the planes and association of the true with atemporality that it had in bardic conception, although these would only become fully realized with the completion of the progressive abstraction of PSM in the thought of Parmenides.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 206, 211, 231, 237 and 244--6</d-footnote> This does not take us beyond the homology we have established in the preceding sections, but it does confirm it and expand our understanding of the grounds of its development in PSM.</p> <p>In a similar fashion, Seaford’s account of the development of the opposition between concrete use-value and abstract value in coinage confirms and expands our understanding of its role in the development of PSM. He argues that coinage brings out this opposition, in two ways. The first is by diminishing the importance of the material qualities of the metal (its weight, purity, etc.) in favor of abstract quantity (the determinations of unit and amount) and the second is by establishing a “systematic discrepancy between the conventional value of a coin and the concrete value of its bullion.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 171.</d-footnote> Together, these increase the visibility of the opposition between use-value and value, and in doing so bring forward the mysterious ideality of value, the way it appears to be an abstract, supersensible element of every commodity, and one that is independent of their concrete material properties and origins.<d-footnote>Cf. Marx, _Capital,_ vol. I, 163--4.</d-footnote> It is this same ideality that characterizes the abstract substance of PSM, which, like value, is conceived of as an abstract universal that unifies the diverse multiplicity of concrete sensible particulars that it is separated off from. Similarly, the progressive abstraction that Seaford emphasizes in the development of PSM from Thales to Parmenides follows the contours of the opposition between abstract value and its concrete monetary embodiment, moving from conceptions that resemble money in being themselves concrete objects separated off from all others as the universal equivalent, the object-type in which their qualitative differences are extinguished and equalized, to those that resemble value in being a pure abstraction, divested of material qualities except insofar as it is embodied in the things that represent its form of appearance.</p> <p>In addition to the introduction of coinage, Seaford’s concreteness allows him to specify a number of other important socio-historical conditions of the emergence of the concept of abstract substance, although, without an explicit concept of the mode of production, he is left to present them (for the most part) as an external aggregate of independent conditions, which prevents him from giving an adequate account of the determinate relationships between them. The most important of these are the crisis of the traditional social order centered around the warrior-aristocracy, the class struggle that accompanied the rise of the Tyrants, and the aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency.<d-footnote>It should be noted here that all three of these suggest an implicit recognition of the importance of the mode of production and its class structure for explaining the emergence and development of PSM, registering some of the effects of the transition that we described above without being able to articulate them together as moments of a totality.</d-footnote> In terms of the first two of these, aside from providing material that was used in constructing our account of the crisis described in Section 2.2 (and Appendix 2), the main thing that Seaford provides us with is confirmation that the social formations in which PSM developed were experiencing acute manifestations of that crisis.<d-footnote>Such as the fact that all of the _poleis_ in which PSM emerged and developed were either experiencing, or had recently experienced, the rule of a tyrant and/or heightened class antagonism. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 183.</d-footnote></p> <p>The third, on the other hand, introduces a new consideration, and one that will play an important part in my own conception of the social determination of PSM. Seaford introduces this ideological consideration in his discussion of Parmenides in order to explain the “problem of <em>why</em> value is abstracted from circulation.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 246.</d-footnote> He thinks that this abstraction of value from circulation lies at the basis of the differences between Parmenides’ concept of substance, which resembles monetary value in its total abstraction, and the substance concepts of his predecessors, which combine elements of both value and circulation in their relative concretion.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 246.</d-footnote> The aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency, which finds its <em>locus classicus</em> in Aristotle’s formulation that, “it is the mark of an <em>eleutheros</em> (free man, gentleman) not to live for the benefit of another,” is introduced as an external ideological factor that acts on the homologous relationship between money and the philosophical content of PSM, unconsciously motivating the separation of abstract value from concrete circulation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247; De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World_, 90, 116--7; 2014, _Rhetoric_, in _The Complete Works of Aristotle:The Revised Oxford Translation,_ ed. Jonathan Barnes, 2176 (1367a32), where the translation is "\...not to live at another's beck and call."</d-footnote> In doing so, it makes self-sufficiency, which Seaford thinks is already latent in the determination of value, into one of the central determinations that defines abstract substance.</p> <p>This ideological determination of PSM brings us closer to our own concern with its ideological character, although it doesn’t go far enough in that direction insofar as it posits the ideological as an external influence that shapes the development of the concept of abstract substance—and does so at a relatively late stage in this development. This relative externality of ideological considerations to the determination of the substance concept of PSM raises the question of what, for Seaford, differentiates the ideological character of the concept of self-sufficiency from the supposedly non-ideological character of the money-derived content of the concept of substance. Seaford does not explicitly spell this out, but it is clear from the way he discusses self-sufficiency that it must be the derivation of the former concept from the class structure of the social formations in question—and from the position of the aristocracy within that structure—that marks it as ideological.</p> <p>Following De Ste. Croix, Seaford describes the “ideology of economic self-sufficiency” as an expression of the “crucial opposition between those who by virtue of their command over the labor power of others were <em>free</em> to lead a civilized life (the ‘propertied class’) and those who had to work to maintain themselves.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247.</d-footnote> The class character of this ideology is introduced in this way only to be dropped and never mentioned again as the discussion turns back to the determination of self-sufficiency and its relation to the monetary determinations of substance.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 247. It is also, as far as I can tell, the only time in which he makes explicit reference to the mode of production in _Money and the Early Greek Mind_.</d-footnote> This is what leads us to identify class origins as the distinguishing mark of ideological content for Seaford. It thereby also allows him to posit the other content of the concept of abstract substance in PSM as non-ideological insofar as it can be seen to <em>originate</em> from the determinations of the money form rather than from the class structure of the social formations in which that concept emerged and developed. This definition of ideology in terms of origins both obscures the ideological character of PSM as a whole and removes the questions of the mode of production and the reciprocal determination of its elements from consideration. As we shall see below, it is only by understanding PSM as determined from the beginning by its ideological function and class character that we can begin to offer an adequate explanation of its origins and development.</p> <h3 id="critiquing-seafords-formalism-32">Critiquing Seaford’s Formalism (3.2)</h3> <p>As I said at the beginning of the last section, Seaford’s account of the emergence and development of PSM gets us a long way towards our goal of explaining the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence. In this section, I will identify the aspects of Seaford’s analysis of the relationship between money and Pre-Socratic Monism that make it insufficient in relation to this goal. I will argue that this insufficiency is related to the formalistic framework of his project, which bears a number of similarities to the aspects of the works of Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel that I criticized at the beginning of this piece.</p> <p>The formalism of Seaford’s approach can be detected in both its aims and its method. It aims at showing that money, or monetization, is a necessary historical condition of possibility of the “genesis and form” of the “metaphysical preconceptions about the basic constituent of the world and its transformations” shared by the various pre-socratic philosophers, or, in other words, of “the counter-intuitive idea of a single substance underlying the plurality of things manifest to the senses.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greak Mind,_ 12 and 175.</d-footnote> Although this is not identical to the Kantian idealism that we saw in Sohn Rethel’s attempt to establish the necessary conditions of possibility of both “scientific cognition” and exchange itself in terms of the normative “postulates,” it still partakes of some of the same formalism, and even has something of the same form insofar as Seaford tends to frame his arguments about the monetary origin of said “preconceptions” in terms of their non-derivability from observation or deduction.<d-footnote>See, e.g. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 252.</d-footnote> The aim of this project is formalist insofar as it aims at establishing the formal grounds of the possibility of PSM, rather than explaining the <em>actuality</em> of its socio-historical determination.<d-footnote>The focus on giving a historical explanation of the seeming _apriority_ of its preconceptions adds to this formalism</d-footnote> It is the latter that is our aim here, and this involves giving an account of why, and how, the form determinations of money were taken up into thought (in a disguised form) as the content determinations of abstract substance, rather than simply establishing the necessity (or at least plausibility) of the origination of the latter in the former.</p> <p>Seaford’s argumentative method, while perhaps adequate to this aim, is constrained by the same formalism insofar as it centers around establishing that there is a (relatively complete) homology between the determinations of money and those of abstract substance, then eliminating other possible sources of the content of the latter (or assimilating them under the dominant influence of the monetary determinations on either historical or formal grounds (i.e. by showing the relative incompleteness of the homology between these and abstract substance), thereby establishing money as the source of those conceptual determinations.<d-footnote>See, e.g. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 175--89, 205--9, 217--30 and 246--9. I am not primarily concerned here with the intrinsic weaknesses of this method, although I will note here that these center around the bad infinity of possible conditions and combinations of conditions that necessarily lie outside its eliminative procedure.</d-footnote> In this methodology, the aim of establishing money or monetization as a historical condition of possibility of the concept of monistic substance and the reliance on homology reciprocally determine each other. One the one had, It is only because the historical conditions of PSM are understood as conditions of possibility, and therefore formal conditions, that their “influence” on the latter is able to be analyzed primarily in terms of the formal relationship established by homology. On the other, it is only because that “influence” is understood in terms of homologous correspondence–which allows them to be understood as independent factors whose external conditioning of thought can be registered and isolated out in terms of the presence or absence of shared content–that Seaford is able to determine those historical conditions as <em>conditions of possibility</em> of the concept of abstract substance.<d-footnote>Even the dismissal of certain other conditions on the basis of historical, rather than formal, criteria would not be enough to identify monetization as the decisive condition that differentiates between the circumstances in which PSM emerged and those in which it didn't without the supplementary evidence supplied by the relatively more complete homology of the content determinations of money with those of PSM compared to those other factors.</d-footnote> This reciprocally determining formalism also explains the externality and independence of the conditions in their relationship to each other and to PSM that we noted in the last section, as well as their determination as origins or sources of the content of PSM.</p> <p>Seaford does attempt to offer an explanatory mechanism that could bridge the gap between socio-historical conditions of possibility and the actual relationship between thought and those conditions, but it is caught up in many of the same problems as his overall approach. His proposal for addressing both the why and the how of the homology between the money form and the substance concept of PSM is the “unconscious cosmological projection of abstract monetary substance.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 12.</d-footnote> He portrays this unconscious cosmological projection of money (or of its universal power and exchangeability) as a particular instance of a more general phenomenon in which cosmic order is unconsciously imagined on the basis of the dominant human social institutions in a given society.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 11 and 224--5. The inadequacy of unconscious cosmological projection as an explanation of the relationship between monetization and PSM can already be seen here in the slippage between monetary substance, which presumably refers to value as an _abstract object_ distinguishable from its _concrete monetary form of appearance_, and the universal power and exchangeability of money, which refer to _social functions_ of money arising from the concrete instantiation of value in the process and relations of exchange. Universal power in particular should not be seen as a property of money itself, but as a description of one of the social functions that it has for its possessors. This confusion about what exactly is being projected produces a certain looseness that facilitates the overall argument but simultaneously reduces its clarity and raises questions about its validity.</d-footnote> The determinate difference between PSM and other instances of this projection would then be the fact that the cosmic order takes on the abstract and impersonal determinations of money rather than, for example, the personal characteristics of the monarchical household or the redistributive form of the sacrificial feast.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 11 and 224--5.</d-footnote> In this conception, PSM, “like all representations of the cosmos…attempts to discover order and uniformity underlying apparent chaos.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote> Seaford thus suggests a transhistorical psychological mechanism that responds to a transhistorical psychological need for order and uniformity, in which objects are projected or “imagined” as a model for cosmological representation because they stand out as embodiments of order in their societies, and so can be “abstracted from the potential chaos of experience.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote></p> <p>The largest problem with this explanation is that the concept of projection itself is vague and Seaford does nothing to clarify the sense in which he is using it. As Laplanche and Pontalis had already pointed out in 1967, projection has been used in a number of different, often ill defined, senses, most of which can be reduced down to a general notion of displacement or externalization of an element (typically a psychological or neurological element).<d-footnote>Jean Laplanche and Jean-Bertrand Pontalis, _The Language of Psychoanalysis_, trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith (Routledge, 2018), 349.</d-footnote> In contrast to this is the psychoanalytic conception, in which this externalization is predicated on a rejection of or refusal to recognize the projected element (as belonging to the subject).<d-footnote>Laplanche, _Language of Psychoanalysis,_ 349.</d-footnote> Seaford gives no indication of using projection in the more specified psychoanalytic sense, despite this leaving no explanation for <em>why</em> this projection happens aside from a similarly vague (and, in my opinion, highly suspect) assertion of a transhistorical relation between cosmological representations and “attempts to discover order and uniformity underlying apparent chaos.”<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224. Note the similarity to Marcuse's 'quest for unity and universality.'</d-footnote> Indeed, the element supposed to be projected, “human institutions” which are the “elements of the familiar that “especially embody the order and uniformity that is abstracted from the potential chaos of experience,” is similarly indeterminate (and therefore both highly contestable and at the same time imbued with an immediate sense of plausibility).<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 224.</d-footnote> Not only that, but the unconscious nature of the proposed projection relies on a similarly underdetermined notion of the unconscious that leaves out the psychoanalytic emphasis on repression as a constitutive factor in unconscious operations, which leaves us with little idea as to what causes the unconscious repression and projection of social institutions, as opposed to a conscious transformation of the material in thought. Ultimately, the only answers Seaford provides as to why we should take unconscious cosmological projection to be the mechanism through which money determines the ideas introduced by PSM are non-answers insofar as they do little more than re-assert the existence of the formal correspondence established by his general approach—a correspondence they were meant to explain.</p> <p>Another reason for the inadequacy of Seaford’s account for our purposes is that he doesn’t give enough consideration to the <em>function</em> of PSM, or its central metaphysical concepts, within the broader social situation that they arise in, or within the determinate class relations that condition the individuals who developed it. This further consigns his explanation to its repetitive dependence on the homology between the money form and the concept of abstract substance and prevents him from escaping the charges of developing a reflection theory of socio-economic determination, despite his attempts to avoid the latter by acknowledging and integrating into his conception other sources of determination like political developments, mythological predecessors, ideological influences, and ego formation.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind,_ 12 and 217--30.</d-footnote> To clarify, it is not that these factors do not play a part in the development of PSM but rather that acknowledging them without integrating them into a broader functional conception fails to recognizes the main problem with reflection theories, which lies in their formalism rather than their limited breadth, and, in doing so, reproduces that problem. It is to elaborating such a functional conception and showing how it allows us to bring together the disparate elements of our exposition up to this point that we shall turn in the next section.</p> <h3 id="the-emergence-of-essence-33">The Emergence of Essence (3.3)</h3> <p>In order to avoid the problems that we attributed above to the formalism of Seaford’s approach, we must return to the crisis of aristocracy, and the series of developing social crises it kicked off and remained entangled with, and understand PSM in terms of how it functioned as a response to those crises and their development. In particular, we should understand it as a response to acute moments of crisis by members of the aristocracy that had specific functions in relation to their class position. The acute crisis brought on by rapid monetization after the introduction of coinage would have brought into sharper focus the disjunction between the ideological and libidinal constitution of the aristocratic subject, whose lingering attachment to certain ideas, values, and forms of activity still corresponded to a significant extent to a position within older relations of production that no longer characterized the reality they found themselves in and had to navigate in order to reproduce themselves both as individuals and as a class.<d-footnote>This is especially true if we take into account Sartre's points about the importance of childhood and the class situation of the previous generations in ideological formation. See Jean-Paul Sartre, _Search for a Method_, trans. Hazel E. Barnes (Knopf, 1963), 57--65.</d-footnote></p> <p>In this light, the conceptual innovations of PSM should be seen as a part of the broader aristocratic response to the acute developments of this crisis brought on by the rapid monetization of the social formations in which they arose. In general, it functioned to refashion the ideological foundations of the rule, self-conception and general worldview of the aristocracy in response to the threats posed to them by crisis—and the role the previous aristocratic ideological forms continued to play in the development and perpetuation of said crisis. Earlier, we saw how neither the nostalgic omission characteristic of Homer’s early response to the crisis brought on by commercialization, nor the anxious denigration of Theognis’ response, was able to adequately orient them to these changing conditions. At the same time, we saw how the parallel development of commercialization and the crisis allowed this need for ideological reconfiguration to come out more clearly in the poems of Theognis—where the emptying out of the previous value system had already prompted the beginnings of a reorientation towards new ones—and how this was accompanied by a reconceptualization of truth that mirrored the (still incomplete) objectification of the social function of reproducing the presuppositions of the social formation as a whole. We should understand the development of Pre-Socratic Monism as a new stage in this development of the aristocratic response to crisis in which the rapid and pervasive monetization brought on by the introduction of coinage (along with the other features of coins mentioned above) allowed the early philosophers to develop an ideological account that was able to more adequately respond to the crises they faced.</p> <p>This functional conception aids our attempt to explain the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence in a number of ways. The first is by allowing us to develop a better account of the reasons for the isomorphism between the determinations of its concept of substance and the form-determinations of money. In order to more effectively respond to the social developments facing them, aristocrats in rapidly monetizing <em>poleis</em>, both individually and as a class, needed to develop a more adequate understanding of their societies. The crisis had created an unusual situation in which the reproduction of the exploiting class as a class required not so much a (more or less direct) reproduction of the ruling ideology, and its forms practice and “know-how”, as a <em>fundamental transformation of the ruling ideology</em> on the basis of which the exploiting class could refashion its misaligned and counter-productive forms of practice and “know-how.”<d-footnote>This conception of the ruling ideology and its relation to practice and "know-how" draws from Louis Althusser, _On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses_, trans. G.M. Goshgarian (Verso, 2014), 235--6.</d-footnote> So, when I say they needed to develop a more adequate understanding, I do not mean this simply in the sense of abstract or instrumental knowledge, but rather in the sense of a conceptual anchoring point, a reality schema, on the basis of which they could ensure the effectiveness of this reorientation.Their societies were increasingly constituted as interdependent totalities given unity by money as the singular concrete embodiment of the abstract value of commodities, for which they were universally exchangeable and in which they expressed their equivalence and interchangeability with each other. In positing the universe in a similar fashion, as an ordered impersonal totality in which multiplicity is given unity by a single universal substance, PSM provided a conceptual schema that corresponded to the new reality adequately enough to serve as a foundation for this necessary ideological realignment.<d-footnote>This does not mean that it was the only schema developed to fulfill such a function, or that it did so perfectly, although the lasting influence of its conceptual innovations attest to its success---at least among certain fractions of the aristocracy.</d-footnote> In this context, we can understand the isomorphism between its determinations and those of the money form as a consequence of the ideological demands made upon the aristocracy by the crisis.<d-footnote>It is important to note that it was not just the internal crisis of aristocracy that necessitated this ideological realignment but also the heightened conditions of class struggle and external social crisis that demanded their reconfiguration as a class.</d-footnote></p> <p>Our functional conception also allows us to return to the question we raised in Section 2.1 about the continuities between the Bardic conception of truth and the determination of truth in PSM, in which key elements of the earlier conception persisted despite the objectification of the social function of the bard, which eliminated the direct connection between speech and the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social totality—a connection on which the truth of that speech had rested. As I noted above, Theognis’ transitional conception of Truth did not just correspond to the (incomplete) objectification of the formerly subjective presuppositions, but also to the attempt to reconfigure aristocratic values and redefine aristocracy on the basis of those values, however limited that attempt may have been. This ideological project provides a functional reason for the retention of the concept of truth among both Theognis and the pre-socratics, despite the collapse of the social relationships in which the traditional conception had been embedded.<d-footnote>For the conception of a project used here, see Sartre, _Search for a Method_, 93--100; and Fredric Jameson, _Marxism and Form: Twentieth Century Dialectical Theories of Literature_ (Princeton University Press, 1974), 214--21.</d-footnote> The goal of that project was to reestablish, to the extent that they could, the position they had previously enjoyed before the crisis, and in particular before the usurpation of the tyrants, as well as the general challenging of their status from below by the broader lower classes connected to this usurpation. In response to these challenges, they looked back to the previous fount of aristocratic legitimacy and attempted to adapt it to the conditions they found themselves in.<d-footnote>This is supported by the explicit incorporation of more anachronistic mythico-religious elements connected to the traditional conception of truth in the presentation of the various pre-socratics, such as the residual mythological elements and aspects of the mystery cults that informed both the form and content of PSM, especially in the works of Heraclitus and Parmenides. See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 217--30 and 231--42; and Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 130--4.</d-footnote> The tension between this restorative tendency and the adaptive one discussed in the preceding paragraph goes a long way towards explaining the reasons why the traditional conception of truth was both partially retained and at the same time maintained its correspondence with the now objectified social presupposition of the social formation.</p> <p>There was a double reciprocality between the subjective project of the aristocratic proponents of PSM and the objective conditions in which that project was formulated. On the first level, the objective conditions determined the needs that the project constituted a response to and the class situation in which those needs and that response were situated, while the subjective project determined the specific way in which those needs would be taken up—i.e. in terms of the inherited traditions of the aristocratic subjects who formulated and developed that project and the promise of restoration that they held out. On the second level, the objective conditions also made it so that the subjective project could not be formulated along the same lines as it had been before. The objectification of the reproduction of the social presuppositions of the social formation as a whole, and the need for a reality schema on which to base the project of ideological realignment, meant that the traditional concept of truth had to be reformulated, while, from the subjective side, the contours of that traditional conception seem to have determined that reformulation as a reformulation that retained its connection to the (now objective) social presuppositions.</p> <p>To fully understand this last point, we must examine the subjective reasons for retaining a conception of truth a little more closely. What was the appeal of a conception of truth for the aristocratic proponents of PSM? While we cannot say for certain, the most likely reason for this appeal, and the one that best explains the continued centrality of the social presuppositions to this conception, is that it has something to do with the <em>transcendence</em> enabled by the supersensible and atemporal aspects of truth, which was based on the <em>social</em> transcendence of the presuppositions of the social formation.<d-footnote>As we saw in Section 3.1, Seaford attributes this social transcendence to the "integrative power" of money, and the way in which it becomes a necessary form of mediation on which the individual and community both depend. This is not necessarily wrong, as both of these are aspects of its role as a presupposition of the social formation as a whole, but it does not fully grasp why that role makes it socially transcendent. As I argued in Section 2.1, it was the place of the cultural presuppositions reproduced by the bard outside of the sensuous activity of the community as conditions of communal production that were not themselves produced by the community that constituted their social transcendence. With money, the situation is similar, although it is produced by the community. The reason why it still functions as a presupposition despite being produced as a part of the communal labor is because of the way that the process of commercialization individualizes social production and posits money as the sole representative of the _sociality_ of labor. In this way, money can be seen as socially transcendent insofar as it stands outside the individual processes of production that constitute the total social labor and, though itself produced, is separated off from the rest of social production as the ground of its determination as _social_ production.</d-footnote> This transcendence allowed the aristocratic proponents of PSM to eternalize their position in the relations of exploitation, which was beneficial as a means of both legitimating the aristocracy as a whole, and of strengthening the claims of their ideological project in relation to other aristocratic ideologies that did not invoke the same transcendence (and which likely represented newer, more commercialized class fractions).<d-footnote>On this last point, see Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 107--10.</d-footnote></p> <p>We can see here how the function of legitimating the rule of the aristocracy, which, in Section 2.1, we separated out in discussing the social function of the bard in as the less important side in terms of understanding the determination of truth, actually played a role in the persistence of that determination after the concrete relations in which it was embedded dissolved, and of its connection to the social transcendence of the social presuppositions. Without the direct connection that existed between bardic speech and the reproduction of those presuppositions, it was this function of legitimation and its connection to that transcendence that maintained the overall connection between truth and the now-objectified presuppositions. At the same time both the dissolution of that direct connection and the objectification of those presuppositions meant that truth had to be configured differently to maintain its general ideological functionality.<d-footnote>For example, the truth of a statement could no longer be seen as attached to the social position of the speaker, but instead had to be understood as independent and objective, and so (in principle) universally accessible, but, at the same time, increasingly contestable and relative insofar as its independence and objectivity separated it from its connection to any specific individual.</d-footnote></p> <p>The third way in which our functional conception of PSM helps us is by allowing us to specify the relationship between the monetary content of PSM and the aristocratic ideology of self-sufficiency that we discussed in Section 3.1. This ideology of self-sufficiency, already recognizable in Homer, increasingly revealed itself to be the bedrock on which the distinction between aristocrat and non-aristocrat could be made as the monetary confusions of the crisis were worked out and weaker elements of the traditional concept of aristocracy, like heredity, fell to the wayside as the class was reconstituted along the lines set out by the transforming mode of exploitation and commercialization.<d-footnote>De Ste. Croix, _Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World_, 114--7; Moses Finley, _The World of Odysseus_ (New York Review Books, 2002), 68--70.</d-footnote> In this sense, it both pre-existed the developments of PSM and had a certain centrality to the ideological project of the aristocracy as a whole that exceeded the bounds of the specific project that animated PSM. So, to a certain extent, Seaford was right to pose it as external to PSM, but, by understanding it as a supplementary influence that modified and introduced extraneous content to the money-derived content of PSM, he did not understand the way in which the two were co-constitutive in the formulation of PSM and reciprocally determined one another.</p> <p>Both the reconfiguration of truth according to the determinations of the money form and the definition of aristocracy in terms of self sufficiency should be seen as part of the same project of ideological realignment that represented the subjective moment of the determination of PSM. The ideology of self-sufficiency centered around an abstract negation of dependence that allowed the aristocrat to be distinguished from both the commoner and the slave (and from women, who, even if part of an aristocratic household, were considered dependent on the male householder), and made the definition of aristocracy the same as that of freedom, which as a moral ideal provided both a justification for aristocratic rule and a normative standard on which individual conduct could be guided and evaluated, and thereby brought into line with the continuing reproduction of the mode of exploitation.<d-footnote>This alignment of aristocracy and freedom also played a significant role in bringing the conduct of the democratic _polis_ as a whole into line with the reproduction of the relations of exploitation in so far as political freedom took on the same determinations and thereby shaped the norms and expectations of inter-_polis_ relations and conduct for the citizen body in general.</d-footnote> The importance of this emphasis on self-sufficiency can be seen not just in the later developments of a figure like Parmenides, as Seaford emphasizes, but already in one of the earliest formulations of the doctrine of PSM, that of Anaximander, whose <em>apeiron</em>, aside from taking on the determinations of money (especially in its function as means of circulation), is said to have no beginning, and to surround and steer all things.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 192. Seaford does suggest the possibility of earlier influences of the ideology of self-sufficiency, but only traces it back to Xenophanes, merely raises the possibility without following through on it, and does not see how much of a constitutive role it plays in the overall substance conception of PSM. See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 212 and 248.</d-footnote> This connection of abstract substance with stasis and independence clearly has something to do with the transcendence of truth that we discussed above, but its specific form, especially the way in which the <em>apeiron</em> “steers all things” from its position of static independence, bears a significant resemblance to the ideology of self-sufficiency and the aristocratic class position on which it was based.</p> <p>If we take a closer look at that class position in relation to the monetized economy of the <em>polis</em>, and the way in which aristocratic ideology represents a one-sided abstraction that covers over the contradictions inherent in that relation, this resemblance becomes even more telling. As the primary owners of the land and slaves through which the surplus product, on which the whole monetary economy of the polis was based, was appropriated, the aristocracy did indeed have a certain foundational independence in relation to that economy. At the same time, this appearance of independence, which expressed itself in the one-sided abstraction of the ideology of self-sufficiency, was matched by a reciprocal dependence on the slaves whose surplus labor supported their consumption, on the commodified division of labor that was inseparable from said surplus appropriation, and on the goods (and services) they received in exchange for the products of the surplus labor they appropriated, without which they could not have lived as they did.<d-footnote>This one sided appearance of independence was strengthened by the fact that, as owners of agricultural land and slaves to work it, most aristocrats could hypothetically have supported themselves and their households without engaging in exchange, although probably only temporarily and, again, not in the concrete ways in which they actually lived. Furthermore, the goods that supported both the immediate consumption of the aristocracy and the exchange they engaged in had become their property neither as a result of their own labor nor through exchange, so that when they were exchanged (or consumed), they appeared to a certain extent as not just a foundation, but an unproduced foundation, separated both spatially and socially from the process of becoming that gave rise to it. From the perspective we developed above in relation to the social presuppositions of the social formation, it could be said that the ideology of self-sufficiency had its roots in aristocratic control of the other major presuppositions of the social formation, land and slaves, from which it obtained its own transcendence..</d-footnote> From the perspective of this one-sided self-sufficiency, the aristocracy could appear as a static, unproduced foundation of the social formation as a whole, one which steered the whole world of exchange-mediated activity and covered over the aristocracy’s own dependence on both that world of exchange and the slaves whose labor provided the foundation of their existence and social position. It was this one-sided abstraction of the aristocratic position in terms of independence that was transferred to the abstract substance of PSM and increasingly made self-sufficiency into one of its core determinations.</p> <p>This combination of determinations derived from the money form and the ideology of self-sufficiency (or the contradictory objective situation that it covered over) were complementary and helped to stabilize each other. The determination of truth as essence allowed the proponents of PSM to compensate for the one-sidedness of aristocratic self-sufficiency by aligning independence with true reality and consigning the side of aristocratic dependence to the inessential (and, following the absolute distinction posited by Parmenides, <em>untrue</em>) world of becoming. It also supplemented the ideological function of distinguishing between aristocrats and non-aristocrats on the basis of self-sufficiency with a positive account of their right to rule on the basis of intellectual superiority or access to truth. The determination of self sufficiency, on the other hand, allowed them to cohere and stabilize the concept of abstract substance itself in its reflection of the contradiction between the abstract value and concrete embodiment of money.<d-footnote>This is evidenced by the progressive abstraction of the substance concepts of the pre-socratics (which will be discussed more below), which was accompanied by an increasing prominence of the determination of self-sufficiency. Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 244.</d-footnote> It also counteracted (to some extent) the deprivileging of truth that had resulted from the objectification of the social function of the bard by re-establishing a connection between truth and the position of the aristocrat.<d-footnote>This was also aided by the class position of the aristocracy itself, which both ensured that they were the main people who had the free time necessary for metaphysical inquiry and, by separating them from the immediate process of production, promoted their development of an abstract consciousness suited to those pursuits.</d-footnote> Together, these factors allowed the aristocratic proponents of PSM to depict themselves as the expositers of an esoteric (even if <em>in principle</em> universal) doctrine that granted access to true reality in opposition to the mere appearance of everyday life, but only for the few whose social position identified them with that truth and enabled them to reach the heights of abstract intellect needed to understand that doctrine.</p> <p>Our functional conception of PSM has already allowed us to develop a much more concrete conception of the emergence of the concept of essence in PSM, but there is one crucial question left to be answered in order to fill out this picture. This is the question of why the determinations of money took the form of cosmological or metaphysical determinations about the universe, or why they were displaced from their social context into the cosmological/metaphysical register. The first likely reason for this is that despite the innovativeness of their new conception, the early philosophers still did not produce it from thin air. The thinkers in the tradition of PSM needed to draw on the ideological resources present to them in order to refashion them, and these were largely cosmological and mytho-poetic.<d-footnote>See Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 217--30.</d-footnote> As the tradition developed, we can see a progressive detachment from these origins, what some have referred to as a secularization, but never a full break.<d-footnote>Detienne, _Masters of Truth_, 89--106 and 130.</d-footnote> The second reason is that despite needing to develop a conception that allowed them to orient themselves within the newly and increasingly monetized social world they lived in, explaining that world, or the mechanisms of its monetary mediation, was not the primary (implicit or explicit) aim of their accounts. These accounts responded to the conflict and confusion caused by the misalignment between aristocratic ideology and its social conditions, and its primary function should be seen in terms of refashioning that ideology rather than directly explaining those conditions. In fact, the latter aim probably wouldn’t have been a legible project given the ideological foundations that served as their starting point—although it would become one for a figure like Aristotle, but only after the ideological and philosophical changes that PSM inaugurated had developed and entrenched themselves. The third, and most significant, reason brings us back to the critique of Seaford’s unconscious cosmological projection that I made above. I mentioned there that Seaford’s use of the psychological concepts of projection and the unconscious ignored the psychoanalytic specification of these mechanisms in terms of a negative reaction to some content that is unable to be recognized. From this perspective, we can see the displacement of the determinations of money from their social context into the realm of pure thought as a response to some aspect(s) of the social content of the former that they were unable (or unwilling) to recognize, or, to put it in more Jamesonian language, we can see it as an imaginary solution to the real contradiction between money or monetization and their own class position and ideological project.<d-footnote>Jameson, _The Political Unconscious_, 79.</d-footnote></p> <p>The primary contradiction that motivated this displacement was between the equality of abstract human labor, which is posited by the money form, and the relations of exploitation that determined the class position of the aristocracy, which posited an inequality between the labor of slaves and that of free men. Marx himself notes this as an explanation for Aristotle’s inability to develop a concept of value in the first chapter of <em>Capital.</em> He says that “Aristotle himself was unable to extract this fact, that, in the form of commodity values, all labor is expressed as equal human labor and therefore as labor of equal quality, by inspection from the form of value, because Greek society was founded on the labor of slaves, hence had as its natural basis the inequality of men and of their labor-powers.”<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 151--2. Although it is clear that Aristotle was able to turn the concept of essence back on the original context from which its primary determinations originated, it is also clear that this is a secondary application of the primarily metaphysical concept, and therefore still dependent on the distancing effected by the original displacement, and also that he was still unable to directly apply it to the analysis of value or money itself, whose essence he cannot identify, leading him to declare it inessential and untrue.</d-footnote> If we take the class-situated demand for ideological realignment made by the crisis and the objectification of the social function of the bard as the positive grounds of the functionally-determined taking up of the money form by PSM, then we can take this contradiction between the equality posited by money and the inequality posited by slavery (which has its roots in the same conditions that produced the crisis and its demands) as the negative ground that determined that taking up as a displacement into the cosmological/metaphysical register. We can also see how the ideological project itself further determined the inability to take up this contradiction, which would have stood in opposition to its aim of legitimizing the position of the aristocracy in the relations of exploitation.</p> <p>There is another way in which this equality posited by the money-form may have served as a negative ground of the development of PSM. In order to posit the equality of different concrete labors, money must simultaneously posit them as homogenous fractions of the total social labor. In exchanging their products for money, the owners of those products posit the labor that went into them as as equal not to a specific other kind of labor, but rather to all other kinds of labor that have their equivalent in money, and this is what allows the value of the different products of those labors to appear “as values of quantitatively comparable magnitude.”<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 159.</d-footnote> In doing so, those owners posit their labor in relation to the sum total of the labor in their society, but in an externalized form, as a relation between objects, rather than as a relation between people.<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 164.</d-footnote> At the same time, the process of commercialization that gives rise to money increases the division of labor and in doing so it also increases the degree of interdependence between the producers, integrating previously independent branches of production, and communities, into the unified division of labor of a broader social formation.<d-footnote>Marx, _Capital_, vol. I, 471-2.</d-footnote> This means that money, along with the commercialization process that it represents the formal culmination of, makes a number of independent communities into an interdependent social totality in a new and more comprehensive way, turns the implicit and subjective unity of those communities (in which which the primary processes of production had, for the most part, been conducted on the basis of the independent household with the function of reproducing that household) into an explicit and objective one, and, at the same time, obscures the social character and interdependence of the various labor processes which it brings into relation and thereby constitutes as fractions of the total social labor, and does so exactly insofar as it enacts that objectification.<d-footnote>Contra Marx, I think that the way in which the commodity and money forms constitute labor as a fraction of a social whole should also be understood as the basis of the qualitative equality of the different labors objectified in the process of exchange. Marx's proposal, that it is their physiological equality insofar as they are expenditures of human muscles, nerves, etc. that forms the basis of their commensurability as quantities of abstract labor, relies on something external to the commodity form to explain the equalization posited by it. While this remains a possibility, it seems more likely to me that the equalization posited by the commodity form has its basis in an aspect of that form itself rather than in an external abstraction, the concrete derivation of which from the act of exchange seems unclear. Exchange itself, and especially monetary exchange, posits the different labors as social at the same time as it posits them as equal, so it seems reasonable to look for the basis of their equality in the sociality posited along with it. In fact, as we saw above, the quantitative comparability of commodities (in which their equality is expressed) is itself based on their exchangeability not with each other directly, but with the embodiment of abstract social labor. This allows us to identify the equality between the labor embodied in exchanged commodities and the quantitative determination of their value as labor _time_ as both having their origin in the way in which exchange posits the different labors as a fraction of the total social labor, with the former deriving from the socialization it effects and the latter from the externalization. It also suggests a possible basis in the commodity form itself for the persistent reappearance of assertions of the inequality of human beings under capitalism, in the form of theoretical and practical racism, despite the tendency to acknowledge the realization of formal equality on the basis of the wage relation. On this account of the origins of equalization, that persistent tendency to racialization could be understood as having its basis in the commodity form insofar as 1) the necessarily nation-state-based organization of capitalist social formations whose economic self-identity is expressed in the differential exchange rates between different national currencies keeps the world broken up into a multiplicity of separate social totalities, which provides a material basis for denying the extension of the principle of formal equality beyond the bounds of the national community (and the derivative ideological expansion of this denial to include members of the racist's nation who can be imaginatively identified as foreign), and 2) the continuing inability to recognize the social content of the commodity form due to the externalized form of social totality posited by the commodity, and the fetishism resulting from it, also undermines the recognition of equality by obscuring its origins and contributing to its ideological slipperiness insofar as it provides a basis for its continuing determination as abstract, merely formal equality. On the national organization of capitalist social formations and the exchange rates between national currencies, see John Milios and Dimitris P. Sotiropoulos, _Rethinking Imperialism: A Study of Capitalist Rule_ (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), 105--8 and 154--9.</d-footnote> As we saw above, the ideology of self-sufficiency was based in the one-sided abstraction away from the interdependent side of this contradiction, and so recognizing this sociality would have further prevented PSM from fulfilling its function insofar as it undermined the functionality of that ideology.</p> <p>This explanation of the displacement also allows us to understand the process of progressive abstraction that we discussed above, in which the attempt to identify the nature of the underlying substance moved from candidates that resembled the concrete use-value of money to candidates that resembled its abstract value.<d-footnote>See Section 3.1.</d-footnote> Now, we can see how the contours of that development, as well as the confusion that prompted it, were results of this negative ground of the displacement of the money form. It was the way in which this displacement and its grounds (along with the inherent fetishism of the money form) obscured the <em>actual substance</em> of value—abstract labor—that determined the form of PSM as a identificatory search and determined the poles within which the development took place. It was because this actual substance was inaccessible that the concept of substance arose in the form of a question as to the identity of that substance, and that the contours of the development took place between the contradictory poles of that substance’s form of appearance, the relation between which cannot be reconciled without a notion of that substance itself.</p> <p>This absence created an instability in the conceptual content of the early formulations of PSM in which it oscillated between the poles of the contradiction, and it was the determination of self sufficiency that helped stabilize this oscillation by driving the process of progressive abstraction noted by Seaford. As PSM developed, there was a simultaneous increase in the prominence of self sufficiency in the substance concepts of its proponents and in the abstraction of that concept as it moved from a greater resemblance to concrete money toward one to abstract value, until, with Parmenides concept of abstract Being, the determinations of truth became completely identified with determinations of self-subsistent abstract value.<d-footnote>Seaford, _Money and the Early Greek Mind_, 244.</d-footnote> This is not necessarily to say that Parmenides’ conception more adequately reflects the substance of value, which, though abstract, is the result of a process of mediation that it cannot be separated from (which probably makes it more akin to Heraclitus’ conception and its “reversible exchange”), but rather that in it the one-sided abstraction of value and the one-sided abstraction of self-sufficiency developed into a relatively stable form in which each covered over the defects of the other—thus bringing to a close the first first phase of the development of the concept of essence in Ancient Greece in which the question of substance, of identifying the <em>arche</em>, was primary.<d-footnote>For a discussion of "reversible exchange" in Heraclitus, see Chris Kassam, "Heraclitus, Seaford and Reversible Exchange," _The Journal of Speculative Philosophy_ 31, no. 4 (2017): 609--33, &lt;https://doi.org/10.5325/jspecphil.31.4.0609&gt;. I think that Kassam overemphasizes the extent to which the reversibility of exchange in Heraclitus negates the increased level of abstraction that Seaford identifies there. It seems clear to me that Heraclitus posits substance as the inseparable unity of both the abstract self-subsistence of the one and the concrete becoming of the many, while at the same time privileging the one as the underlying moment and ground of the truth of the movement. My favorite example of this is D50 (B54), which Laks and Most translate as "Invisible fitting-together (_harmoniê_), stronger than a visible one." Besides already asserting the precedence of invisible harmony, and so the abstract moment, in terms of its content, this fragment also enacts it formally. The greek text is structured as two pairs of oppositions, an inner opposition between _aphanēs_ (invisible) and _phanerēs_ (visible), which itself has a visible harmony in terms of its morphology, and an outer opposition between _harmoniê_ (fitting-together/harmony) and _kreíttōn_ (stronger), the latter of which originally meant superiority granted to the warrior-aristocrat by the gods and was connected to the idea of domination and came to have a distinct physical/martial sense compared to the other comparative forms that were used to mean 'better.' This seems to be an unreconciled contradiction both visibly and in terms of meaning, but, in the context of the sentence, there is an invisible harmony insofar as the outer terms both determine the relationship between the terms of the inner opposition, with the first providing a substrate of sorts for the meaning of visible and invisible (as both referring to harmonies) and the second providing the structure of their relation. Thus, the outer terms not only create an invisible harmony between the inner terms but also reconcile their own opposition through that act of providing invisible harmony to the inner opposition. It is this invisible harmony that establishes the harmony of the fragment as a whole, that reconciles the opposition between form and content and into which it had divided itself.

This crisis, and the misalignment it caused between the ideological constitution of the aristocracy and objective conditions they found themselves in, created a demand for fundamental ideological realignment that the Pre-Socratic Monists attempted to meet. To do so, they took up and adapted the traditional conception of truth as a means of both reasserting the legitimacy which it had conferred upon their predecessors and providing a reality schema on the basis of which the required reorientation could be grounded. This meant reconfiguring that conception on the basis of the determinations of money, which had taken the place of the customary and cultural traditions reproduced by the bard as the social presupposition of the social totality. At the same time, the contradiction between the substance of value and the position of the aristocracy required the determinations of money to be taken up in a disguised form in order to retain their functional value, displacing them into the cosmological/metaphysical register. But, this reconfiguration of truth on the basis of the displaced form determinations of money could not fulfill the ideological function demanded of it by the crisis on its own. It both required supplementation from, and helped cover over the one-sidedness of, the pre-existing and developing aristocratic ideology of self sufficiency, which provided a basic definition of the aristocrat on the basis of their place in the relations of exploitation, helped stabilize the conceptual confusion caused by the displacement of money, and determined the development of the concept of substance towards increasing abstraction and correspondence with abstract value rather than its concrete embodiment in money.</p> <h2 id="4-conclusion">4. Conclusion</h2> <h3 id="methodological-conclusions-41">Methodological Conclusions (4.1)</h3> <p>At the beginning of this piece, I said that in it I would focus on laying the groundwork for a larger project with two aims: providing a historical materialist account of the origins and development of the concept of essence and developing a Marxist theory of essence that facilitates the project of revolutionary praxis in the present. It is now time to evaluate our progress on these fronts, although, due to the preliminary nature of our investigation, what we will be able to say about the latter will necessarily be more abstract and provisional than what we can say about the former.</p> <p>The contribution made by this piece with respect to the first aim can be broken up into two categories. The first is the confirmation and development of certain theoretical and methodological principles and the second is the provision of a baseline understanding of the emergence of the concept of essence itself in the Greek context. In terms of methodology, the main principles whose fruitfulness I believe has been shown in the course of our investigation, and which I would like to highlight here are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Any explanation of the socio-historical determination of the concept of essence must be grounded in a reconstruction of the concrete historical material corresponding to particular social formations rather than transhistorical determinations or teleological schemas that determine that material retrospectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Such a reconstruction must itself have its basis in the mode of production and its transformations considered as a total social process in which relatively independent spheres and elements reciprocally condition one another in an asymmetrical fashion that gives priority to the broadly economic base.<d-footnote>See Appendix 1 for a more in depth examination of this principle.</d-footnote></p> </li> <li> <p>Attention must be paid to uneven character of such a process, and especially to the lag between the ideological and subjective elements and the economic base, such as we saw in the case of the misalignment between the ideological constitution of the aristocratic subject and the demands imposed upon them by their changing position in the class structure of their social formations.</p> </li> <li> <p>The identification of a homology between conceptual or ideological elements and economic or more broadly social ones can serve as a starting point for investigation and indicator of a connection between those elements and their conditions of possibility, but this identification must be surpassed to offer a proper explanation.</p> </li> <li> <p>A key element of any such explanation is a functional account of the taking up of certain of the objective contents of such a homology into thought.</p> </li> <li> <p>Such a functional account should involve the two moments of class-situated <em>response</em> to the objective situation and subjective project oriented towards intervening in class struggle–and so acting on the objective conditions that solicited the response.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Principles 4–6 in particular represent the methodological <em>results</em> of the investigation undertaken here, and though they remain open to revision or qualification on the basis of further study, I believe that they provide a strong foundation upon which to conduct such study. One way of viewing such a contribution is as an extension of the Hegelian determination of the concept as purposive activity that takes up and transforms its external conditions, and its Marxist reformulation in terms of labor, to the question of the socio-historical determination of philosophy.<d-footnote>For the Hegelian conception of the concept, see Karen Ng, "From Actuality to the Concept in Hegel's Logic" in _The Oxford Handbook of Hegel_, ed. Dean Moyar (Oxford University Press, 2017). For the Marxist conception, see Marx, _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1884_, 75. See also Appendix 1.</d-footnote> From this perspective, we could generalize them into the principle that <em>the determination of thought by its objective conditions always involves activity on the part of individuals according to their subjective purposes in relation to those conditions.</em></p> <h3 id="historical-conclusions-42">Historical Conclusions (4.2)</h3> <p>On the side of the historical content of the emergence and development of the concept of essence, the conclusions outlined at the end of Section 3.3 provide us with a starting point for constructing a broader narrative of that development up to the present. At the same time, we cannot assume a continuity in either the content or function of the concept of essence after this first phase, and so that construction would require a renewed effort of historical reconstruction of the development of both the concept itself and the conditions in which it developed. It is very possible that its persistence and development, if these can be established, resulted from its taking on different functions for different individuals and class fractions in different periods and circumstances. There is also a need for examining other regions like India and China in which a concept of essence seemed to emerge independently around the same time and incorporating those developments into our overall narrative.<d-footnote>Seaford's _The Origins of Philosophy in Ancient Greece and Ancient China_ could provide a good starting point for this work.</d-footnote> Additionally, it seems likely that in attempting to track the further development of the concept of essence after its emergence, further attention would need to be paid to the relative autonomy of philosophical development as it matures and becomes institutionalized. Still, the above account of the relationship between money and the concept of essence suggests a few candidates for explaining the apparent persistence of that concept under different modes of production and concrete circumstances that seem like fruitful areas for further investigation.</p> <p>The first is the connection between the reconfiguration of truth and the emergence of essence. Since it was the monetized objectification of the social presuppositions that determined the contours of the reconfiguration of truth at the heart of the emergence of the concept of essence, this also seems like a good place to look in terms of generating research questions on the basis of which to investigate the persistence of that concept. Is there a persistent connection between the determinations of essence and the role of money as a preposition of social production? Or between essence (or truth) and the general presuppositions regardless of whether or not these are monetary? Or, is this just a condition of their emergence that ceases to play a role in their persistence as time goes on? What happens when capital takes up both the monetary and non-monetary presuppositions into its own process of realization? Similarly, it seems like the negative conditioning of that emergence due to the inability to recognize the substance of value raises a similar set of questions. In particular, the question of whether the persistence of the displacement at the core of the emergence of the concept of essence has its basis in a continuing inability to recognize the equality and interdependence of human labor seems fruitful, and I have already given some provisional indications of how this continuity might manifest itself under capitalist relations of production in note 126. These are just two possible avenues of inquiry suggested by the project undertaken above, but I think they already provide a more promising basis for developing a concrete account of the history of the concept of essence than those currently available.</p> <h3 id="practical-conclusions-43">Practical Conclusions (4.3)</h3> <p>There is a significant historical distance between the object of my investigation here and revolutionary practice in the present day that makes it harder to evaluate its practical significance, so all of the following will have an even more provisional and suggestive character than even the historical conclusions discussed above. Still, I think elements of the research conducted here can help direct our attention in some pertinent directions in terms of developing a marxist concept of essence adequate to the task of facilitating contemporary revolutionary praxis. Before getting into this, I think it is important to point out that my research has led me to rethink Marcuse’s assumption that truth is a subordinate determination of the concept of essence, and to recognize that it was rather essence that appeared to be a form of the concept of truth, a reconfiguration of it on the basis of changing material conditions and ideological imperatives. It will take further research to determine how this relationship continued to be reconfigured over time, so, for now I will speak of the concept of essence with the understanding that it may in fact be the concept of truth in general that I’m attempting to refer to.</p> <p>The first practical consideration I want to discuss has to do with the points made in section 3.3 about the function of essence as both a reality schema used to ground practic-ideological reorientation and as a means of legitimation of the place of the ruling class in the mode of exploitation. On the one hand, I think that the connection between essence and legitimation calls into question its usefulness for a revolutionary project, in which case it might only be the critique of the concept of essence that is useful to us—insofar as it provides us with a means of dispelling the connection between reality indexing and legitimation propagated by that concept. On the other hand, any revolutionary project itself needs a means of effecting practico-ideological reorientation on the basis of current realities, and this might be one of the ways in which a Marxist concept of essence would be valuable, although it would require disentangling these two functions in such a way that its reality schema could be based not on the reproduction of the current relations of production but instead on their overthrow. How to do this, and whether we need to, remain open questions, but I think the research undertaken here has provided a useful basis for beginning to think these questions through.</p> <p>The second practical consideration relates to the negative grounds discussed near the end of section 3.3 and to Marcuse’s assertion of a relation between essence and freedom. I hope that my overall argument has served to dispel the notion that the concept of essence has any positive connection to any substantive idea of freedom that is not premised on exploitation. At the same time, I do think that the role of the negative grounds of an inability to recognize the equality and interdependence posited by the money form could indicate a negative and indirect relationship between the concept of essence and freedom, although this would require more historical work to verify. If the inability to recognize this content and/or opposition to the implications of its realization continued to provide a foundation for the maintenance of the projected determinations of money as metaphysical determinations in the concept of essence, then we should see this content as the continually returning repressed content that haunts thought throughout the history of philosophy, and the concept of essence as preserving the possibility of the realization of equality and interdependence in a negative manner, as that which cannot be realized in order for it to continue to function conceptually. We could also see this as part of the reason why the concept of essence is able to function as a reality schema for monetized social totality, which itself relies on the non-realization of substantive equality and direct interdependence in order to continue to exist as self-externalized social totality. Ultimately, freedom, in its adequate form as collective self-determination, is derivative of these latter determinations insofar as it is premised on the absence of exploitation and the directly collective self-determination of social production and reproduction, without which the possibility of purposive control of the production apparatus and the free mediation of the relationship between human beings and nature according to consciously determined purposes are impossible. Whether we determine that it is solely the critique of the concept of essence or also its reformulation that facilitates revolutionary practice today, we should take this primacy of equality and interdependence into account and orient ourselves more towards them than towards the freedom that would follow from them, or, in other words, we should orient ourselves towards freedom only insofar as it is seen as a product of the instantiation of substantive equality and collective mediation of our interdependent social production.</p> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Althusser, Louis. <em>On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses</em>.

The result of this flood is that the term now usually connotes a mere pejorative rather than anything of substance. Anyone who wishes to avoid submersion must seek higher ground. Yet academia has shown itself to be a lowland compared to those who have merged theoretical insight with practical activity. It is little wonder, then, that the most coherent conceptions of ideology come from those who stand in large part outside the academy. For this reason, any investigation into ideology must start with the insight of the Young Marx, who noted that philosophy had contended itself with criticizing thought in its abstract form. This was a half-complete task; it did not criticize the real conditions which give rise to illusory abstractions.<d-footnote>See Karl Marx, "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's *Philosophy of Right*: Introduction" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1978), 53-65.</d-footnote> If the Young Prussian was correct that on the other side of the antinomy stood the proletariat, ready to pick up theory as a weapon of its own emancipation, then it should be unsurprising that the most thorough critics of ideology stand on its side.</p> <p>The ambiguous relationship of the Frankfurt School to academia provided fertile ground for a critical theory of ideology. This ambiguity was not of the members’ volition. Misfortunes asserted themselves upon the group but also allowed for reason to work its cunning. The concept of ideology played a central role in the Frankfurt School from the time of Horkheimer’s ascent as director of the <em>Institut für Sozialforschung</em> (IfS). Of course, the Frankfurt School was not the first to investigate the concept. Indeed, one of the first treatments of the concept in the Frankfurt School corpus criticizes extant theories of ideology. However, by dint of their influence and voluminous output, the Frankfurt School’s conception of ideology is a watershed moment in the development of the concept. At its head during these halcyon years was Max Horkheimer, who somewhat facetiously accepted previous director Carl Grünberg’s description of the IfS as a “dictatorship of the director.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "The Present Situation of Social Philosophy" from *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, trans. G. Frederick Hunter, Matthew S. Kramer, and John Torpey (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1993), 11.</d-footnote> His productive flurry during his stint as the head of the IfS deserves special consideration for both its historical breadth and theoretical acumen. It is for this reason that the essay will focus predominantly on Horkheimer, though it will at times refer to other members of the IfS as needed.</p> <p>Horkheimer’s 1930 critique of Karl Mannheim’s <em>Ideology and Utopia</em> is a fruitful starting point for an explanation of the critical theory of ideology. Mannheim’s theory not only has historical importance but is also a useful case study in how abstract and value-free theories of ideology content themselves with retreating to abstraction rather than explaining how ideology functions in the social reproduction of concrete life. By contrast, the theory of ideology that the <em>Institut für Sozialforschung</em> develops is an antidote to these common maladies. Hence, this essay first describes Horkheimer’s criticism of Mannheim in section 2 before laying out the concept of ideology that Horkheimer developed during the 30s. Those unfamiliar with Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge should consult Appendix 3 to orient themselves before continuing.</p> <p>After laying out Horkheimer’s critique of Mannheim, the essay then turns to Horkheimer proper. This section, section 3, forms the bulk of the essay (for obvious reasons), and is for that reason divided into subsections. Subsection 3.1 mainly summarizes the main problems with the sociology of knowledge and lists the pitfalls that a critical theory of ideology should avoid. Next, subsection 3.2 distinguishes between <em>Ideologietheorie</em> and <em>Ideologiekritik</em>, and I argue that these two moments of a critical theory of ideology are both present in Horkheimer’s early work. As one of the primary pitfalls of the sociology of knowledge is its methodology, subsection 3.3 covers methodological matters, arguing that the proper means to analyze ideology in capitalist social relations requires the adoption of a dialectical method. After the methodological background, subsection 3.4 deals with ideology <em>theory</em>, arguing that Horkheimer’s conception of ideology views it as playing a specific <em>functional</em> role in class relations. Subsection 3.5 deals with the other half of the formula: the <em>critical</em> moment of the critical theory of ideology. Throughout this analysis, one sees the contraposition of ideology as falsehood to the concept of <em>totality</em>. Consequently, subsection 3.6 provides some further contextualization of totality as a concept. As the reader may wish for a concrete example of the critical theory of ideology, I end section 3 by recapitulating Horkheimer’s analysis of the bourgeois revolutionary and applying it to Tommaso Campanella. The essay then concludes by flagging some further areas for research.</p> <h2 id="horkheimers-critique-of-mannheim">Horkheimer’s Critique of Mannheim</h2> <p>Horkheimer begins his critique of Mannheim with a methodological point. Mannheim treats Marxist thought as part of his “sociology of knowledge” which explains a social totality. Yet the <em>true</em> purpose of Marxist thought is to change the world, not to explain it.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "A New Concept of Ideology"? from *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, trans. G. Frederick Hunter, Matthew S. Kramer, and John Torpey (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1993), 129.</d-footnote> While Horkheimer sees some value in Mannheim’s work, he does not think it beyond reproach. Mannheim sees the purpose of the sociology of knowledge as not a partisan tool but as a “sociological history of thought.” This intellectual field seems impossible to water, as even the sociologist’s worldview is situationally determined. Hence, the prospect of impartiality in the sociology of knowledge is grim. The sociology of knowledge aims to provide us a way out of the academic crisis of the era, in which “faith in the unconditional validity of the various world views [sic] has been fundamentally shaken.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 130.</d-footnote></p> <p>Mannheim distinguishes between <em>particular</em> and <em>total</em> ideologies. The former consists in ascribing the origin of a <em>specific</em> belief to bias or interest. By contrast, the latter casts doubt on an entire opposing <em>Weltanschauung</em>. Much like Kant’s claim that the judgments of experience are the result of our application of the categories, Mannheim argues that our worldviews are the result of categories that are the result of our given situational determination. We thus do not think universally; our social group conditions our thought. Thus, not only <em>what</em> we know is subject to situational determination, but <em>how</em> we think. Hence, the charge of false consciousness has become universalized. Though he invokes false consciousness, Mannheim wants a generalized version of ideology that is not restricted to Marxism.<d-footnote>Ibid., 131.</d-footnote> While Mannheim claims that the total conception of ideology has its <em>origins</em> in Marxist thought, accusations of total ideology are somewhat novel.<d-footnote>Ibid., 130.</d-footnote> To prevent lapsing into philosophical relativism, Mannheim distinguishes between his thesis of situational determination and relativism. The former merely entails that all thought is ultimately rooted in “a definite social situation.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This <em>sociological</em> claim does not require the sociologist of knowledge to take sides and give a moral <em>evaluation</em> of an ideological dispute. The sociologist of knowledge is not an ethicist. They do not judge the moral soundness of a worldview, but only describe it. In effect, Mannheim’s system is the <em>inverse</em> of the meta-ethical expressivism that would become popular a few years later in the Anglosphere.<d-footnote>See A.J. Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic* (London, Penguin Books: 1971).</d-footnote> For both the expressivist and the sociologist of knowledge, there is a strict fact-value distinction. Hence, there is also a strict separation between the act of describing a claim and judging its moral status.<d-footnote>Though perhaps in different ways, since the expressivism in vogue at the time held fast to a positivism wherein every truth was either analytic a priori or a posteriori, empirical, and contingent. Hence Mannheim's Kantian leanings might rub at odds with the Anglophone dismissal of the synthetic a priori.</d-footnote> For the expressivist, moral claims do not <em>describe</em> any mind-independent facts about ethics. Moral language only expresses the speaker’s approval or disapproval of the act in question, or aims to arouse similar sentiments in others.<d-footnote>Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic*, 110-1.</d-footnote> The sociologist of knowledge <em>describes</em> the sociological fact that people’s ideas spring forth from their situational determination without commending or condemning. Just as the expressivist is not in the business of describing the world, the sociologist of knowledge is not in the business of judging it.</p> <p>Despite this point of agreement with expressivists, Mannheim is no positivist. His approach diverges from positivism due to his insistence on the <em>historical</em> element of truth. While positivism held fast to the adage that “facts are stubborn things,” Mannheim insisted that there was no ahistorical unified truth that could survive unblemished. Rather, the validity of a system of thought depends on its historical moment.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 132.</d-footnote> Ideologies have a temporal validity. What was once a valid system of thought may lose its validity. By contrast, some ideologies are <em>utopian</em> because their appearance is too hasty. Utopian ideologies are invalid <em>now</em> but gain validity <em>later</em>.<d-footnote>The obvious example here (though Horkheimer does not give it explicitly) is the utopian socialism of Thomas Müntzer, the Conspiracy of Equals, Fourier, Saint-Simon, and Robert Owen, all of whom saw the utopian element of socialism but whose appearance *pre festum* meant that the categories of thought had were ill-suited to a historical situation with insufficiently developed productive forces.</d-footnote> Thus, the sociologist of knowledge determines the truth or falsity of an ideology in relation to a definite historical period. Hence, false consciousness is theoretically and normatively antiquated consciousness. It is a consciousness whose retrograde elements <em>obscure</em> rather than <em>clarify</em>. The historical moment is the yardstick by which one measures the truth of an ideology. Thus, contra the logical empiricists, truths are not independent, ahistorical entities, but <em>dynamic</em>.</p> <p>To return to 1930, Mannheim diagnoses methodological pluralism as the cause of the crisis in thought.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 133.</d-footnote> Each thought system can grasp bits of the truth and reconcile it to its methodological best practices. But differences in individual social standpoints entail that there is a seeming lack of organic unity in the present. At present, there are several ideologies that are at least in part irreconcilable. These stem from different ways of looking at the world that are situationally determined. The sociology of knowledge seeks to overcome intellectual fragmentation by attempting to stand outside ideologies. In so doing, it aims to show ideologies to be the result of definite historical processes, with the aim of freeing people from their historical determinations.<d-footnote>Ibid., 134.</d-footnote></p> <p>The trouble is that Mannheim misuses Marx. Marx “wanted to transform philosophy into positive science and praxis.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim eschews this task and returns to metaphysics. Mannheim wants to use the sociology of knowledge to reach a higher truth that stands outside the constraints of ideology. Yet he also claims that the truth we reach is not “valid for all times and for all human beings.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim is far from the only person whose denial of a generally valid philosophical system leads to problems.<d-footnote>Per Horkheimer, this is also a problem for Dilthey, who thought we could understand human nature in retrospect. Dilthey's appeal to some Ur-principles makes sense given the rest of his philosophical commitments, but this is not a route available to Mannheim.</d-footnote> Still, his conflation of the development of humanity inside ideologies and historical progress outside the realm of ideology renders ideological entities metaphysically strange.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept,", 135.</d-footnote> Mannheim’s theory cannot appeal to an atemporal human essence given his commitment to the claim that our beliefs are situationally determined. Despite this, he still appeals to an abstract, atemporal human essence. Mannheim wants to <em>both</em> have the plurality of ideologies point to a situational determination of total ideologies which cast doubt on a unifying human essence, and at the same time appeal to some transhistorical humanity, “the essence of which all existing persons carry within themselves.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim makes the same mistake that classical idealist philosophy made. That is, he posits humanity as a metaphysical entity that is unlike any other and does not correspond to the lives of flesh and blood people. But the argument for giving human essence a prime position in the theory is weak. Abstract humanity is an entity which stands outside the behaviors and motivations of sensuous human activity. It thus cannot explain real human behavior and thought. In effect, Horkheimer shows that Mannheim’s appeal to human essence falls prey to a Mackie-esque Argument from Queerness.<d-footnote>See J. L. Mackie, *Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong* (Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1977), 38-42.</d-footnote> If there <em>were</em> a human essence, it would be an entity “of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in”<d-footnote>Ibid., 38.</d-footnote> Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge. The concept of a general total conception of ideology militates <em>against</em> some transhistorical essence which escapes situational determination. Thus, the entire edifice of Mannheim’s theory rests on a foundational essence which the theory states cannot exist.</p> <p>A similar problem befalls Mannheim’s conception of history. This theory does not point to determinate historical entities but appeals to a “realm beyond history.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 137.</d-footnote> Once again, Mannheim confuses the concept of humanity as such for flesh and blood people. The <em>real</em> struggles which claim the lives of millions in their conflagrations "are not the ‘real’ things toward which our investigations are directed."<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Rather, what counts is the conceptual apparatus which changes according to one’s situational determination. Reality <em>as such</em> holds no importance beyond the conceptual apparatus through which one views it. But does this not <em>also</em> apply to the concept of a transhistorical human essence? Once one forgoes the appeal to transcendent humanity, then one is only left with the claim that standpoints are an important part of an overall historical process. Manheim even imbues this belief with a mystical flair which gains a secularized coat of paint via an appeal to historical processes. Again, Horkheimer criticizes Mannheim for his inconsistency. The latter eschews the idea of an eternally valid viewpoint, but qualifies this by claiming that “the ontological decisions according to which we experience and analyze facts increasingly reveals an overarching meaning.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 137-8.</d-footnote> But his appeals to humanity are themselves ideological at base. Mannheim’s appeals to “essence” and “humanity” depend on a conceptual apparatus that his sociological framework casts doubt upon. Even if there <em>were</em> such abstracta, Mannheim’s system gives us a reason to believe that we would be categorically unable to know them. Much like Mackie’s critique of ethics, <em>if</em> some transcendent meaning of history existed, our knowledge of it could only occur through “some special faculty of […] perception or intuition, utterly different from our ordinary ways of knowing everything else.”<d-footnote>Mackie, *Ethics*, 38.</d-footnote> Appealing to metaphysical systems which posit such entities as a given is not a solution. These systems are ones which Mannheim’s system gives us reason to doubt.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 138.</d-footnote></p> <p>Despite his Kantian pretensions, Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge requires dogmatism to buttress it. This is not a problem for the revolutionary critique of ideology, as it tries to do away with metaphysical superstitions. By contrast, Mannheim seeks to ossify them. Marx was correct to cast doubt on abstract humanity as a substitute for flesh and blood men. Hence, Mannheim views the human essence as the subject of history, but for Marx it is the concrete human being “in a definite historical moment.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 139.</d-footnote> To insist on the former is to think ideologically and dismiss “the real sufferings of economically underprivileged classes.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> History, then, “cannot possibly be the expression of some meaningful whole,”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> but is the result of contradictions between men. Materialism has no predefined schema; it cannot stipulate some <em>telos</em> of history. To do so would let it lapse back into the very vagaries it attempts to avoid. Mannheim appeals to abstract entities like a human essence to avoid the charge of relativism. Yet the charge of relativism itself is based on a static ontology which is suspect.<d-footnote>Ibid., 140.</d-footnote> There is no transcendent principle of truth to which to appeal. Hence, Mannheim’s own relativization of all conceptions is itself relative. Horkheimer notes that since “all our ideas […] depend upon conditions that may change, […] the notion of an eternal truth which outlives all perceiving subjects is untenable.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This does not entail scientific skepticism. While the content of the claims that science makes (e.g., about nature) extend beyond the lifetime of humanity, the claims themselves “express something about the relationship of humanity and nature […] but nothing about the relation of truth and being in general.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Mannheim, by contrast, judges the charge of relativism by the yardstick of eternal truth. Despite this, his system casts doubt on eternal truth <em>tout court</em>.</p> <p>For Mannheim, particular ideology is particular because the conditional nature of the determining social situation bars the bearer of any particular ideology from making claims to absolute truth. But the claim of situational determination is incoherent, since it presumes that it itself is not situationally determined; it thereby treats standpoints under the aspect of eternity.<d-footnote>Ibid., 141.</d-footnote> Similarly, Mannheim intended situational determination to avoid the charge of relativism by focusing on the pragmatic upshot of beliefs. But this confuses the true and false with genuine and spurious. Mannheim treats the concept of ideology as one which has intensified and radicalized over time. It blossoms from a particular ideology to a total conception of ideology. From there, the specialized total conception of ideology allows for a general total conception of ideology. This general total conception of ideology creates the possibility of a sociology of knowledge. This sketch includes the claim that ideology has become so totalized that one may treat it with systematic rigor. Yet Horkheimer claims that this unrelenting focus on the general does not do justice to the particular.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> To trace the implications of ideology, as Mannheim does, does not necessarily make it a good theoretical tool. Many scientific theories have failed to prove useful after deep inquiry. There is no guarantee that Mannheim’s theory of ideology would prove different.</p> <p>Moreover, Mannheim depoliticized ideology, especially in the move between particular and total conceptions of ideology. In so doing, he worsens the analysis by failing to account for the link between the political and economic distribution of power and the social concepts in play.<d-footnote>Ibid., 142.</d-footnote> When moving to the total conception of ideology, one must now subject an entire <em>Weltanschauung</em> to ideological critique. In so doing, Mannheim stresses the need to treat nearly everything as ideological. This universalization transforms the concept from a definite accusation to dogmatic metaphysics. This itself is a manifestation of false consciousness. It replaces interests or empirical facts with a vulgar reflection theory as the explanans. Mannheim must also reject modern psychology, which explains the development of men’s ideas in terms of their external needs. For Mannheim, the development of ideas does not depend on real people’s lives, but from their social strata.<d-footnote>Ibid., 143.</d-footnote> This “correspondence of form”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> occurs not only at the level of economic class (as is the case in Vulgar Marxism), but also implies a distinct set of aesthetic, metaphysical, and moral categories in the members of the stratum. Mannheim’s theory relies on ideal types of people, to whom correspond beliefs and worldviews. In doing so, one can afterward “reconstruct” the social situation in which the ideology emerges. This reconstruction should avoid value judgments. This process prevents one from viewing the social situation as a totality, as it reduces it to a mere amalgamation of different viewpoints. Moreover, such a total conception of ideology proves to be as much of an “idealistic overextension”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> as the concept of a human essence. The total concept of ideology depends on the notion of a totality of consciousness, a totality “in the sense of a superficial concept of the whole.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> While such a totality has merit in biology and psychology, it cannot be the case in ideology. This is because people’s consciousness is bound up with the social and environmental surroundings. That is, it is intertwined with definite material social relations.<d-footnote>Ibid., 144.</d-footnote> This does not entail a strict mind-to-world parallelism. The development of a person does not always mirror the development of their society. <em>Weltanschauungen</em> do not develop apart from the socioeconomic conditions in which they appear. To pretend that they are freestanding intellectual constructs is idealist nonsense. Mannheim eschews the non-autonomy of thought from material conditions in favor of a psychological framework which emerges in a sociohistorical reality. In so doing, he merely reinvents the Hegelian <em>Volksgeist</em> with different verbiage. By ignoring the role of power and struggle, Mannheim treats the relationship between an individual and his ideology as if it were deterministic rather than as the result of everyday struggle.<d-footnote>Ibid., 145.</d-footnote> Thus, for Mannheim, the struggle between ideologies stands apart and above the struggle between definite individuals. At one plane of struggle is the struggle of determinate individuals, on another is a struggle between ideologies. The relationship between these two planes is unclear at best.</p> <p>By a <em>general</em> total concept of ideology, Mannheim means that intellectuals understand that situational determination limits <em>every</em> ideology, including one’s own. As such, no ideology can reach eternally valid truth. This renders every pattern of thought ideological. Since Mannheim strips ideology of its accusatory nature, he renders it meaningless. Now, the term merely signifies that a claim lacks access to a mind-independent truth. All ideologies are born in the original sin of situational determination. To be consistent, one must give an account of the categories that one is using, including what “being” and <em>Weltanschauungen</em> are. In contrast to the general total concept of ideology is the <em>special</em> conception of the total concept of ideology. In the special conception, one merely puts into question <em>competing</em> ideologies. The special conception shows promise in giving an account of the relevant categories.<d-footnote>Ibid., 146.</d-footnote> This is most prominent with Mannheim’s ambiguous relationship to Marxism. When talking about the special conception, Mannheim uses Marxism as the ideology with which to criticize all others. On the other hand, Mannheim treats Marxism as one ideology among many which is subject to the critiques of the general conception of total ideology. Thus, Mannheim critiques Marxism but appeals to certain categories of class society uncritically. But without <em>some</em> categories of thought, situational determination loses its meaning, as there are no sociological structures which determine individuals’ ideological beliefs. Without an account of society, Mannheim’s account of situational determination falls apart because it is underdefined. Thus, each ideology may use its own categories when defining situational determination. Marxists can interpret it along lines of social classes and relations of production while idealists may interpret it according to <em>Volksgeister</em>, and so on. Mannheim’s invocation of a social situation is too vague. Horkheimer approvingly cites Troeltsch, who claims that “society” is an ambiguous term and overly abstract unless anchored in economic relations. As it stands, though, the sociology of knowledge lacks the categories which can carve society into the ideal types to which ideologies are situationally determined. This renders it meaningless.</p> <p>A similar problem applies to Mannheim’s notion of ideological appropriateness. Mannheim also must resort to a spiritual examination of the criteria of ideological appropriateness. He grounds the appropriateness of an ideology to its “correctness” to its time (i.e., not obsolete or utopian). But this correctness is itself not based on “an explicit, scientific theory of society.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Thus, correctness becomes arbitrary, epoch-based, and circular. Consider Mannheim’s example of an obsolete ideology: that of a landed proprietor who still views his <em>de facto</em> capitalist estate through the lens of feudal social relations. If viewing the estate in this way is obsolete, it is so thanks to some <em>non-ideological</em> metric. Basing “one’s commitment to this theory on the grounds of its appropriateness to the epoch, which is precisely the basis upon which the theory is to be judged, would be circular.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 148.</d-footnote> Mannheim restricts the analysis of ideology to the cognitive realm. This makes the landowner’s failure a mere epistemic matter. In doing so, he ignores the <em>social</em> function of ideology: i.e., how ideology shapes reality. As a result, Mannheim’s analysis of ideology is one-sided and overly abstract. It analyzes social life as it stands but otherwise leaves social life unexamined. Even when analyzing a specific <em>Weltanschauung</em>, Mannheim does not connect the ideology to its social effects or the relations that bearers of that thought have to the world around them.<d-footnote>Ibid., 149</d-footnote> Despite its sociological façade, Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge contents itself with reintroducing a pseudo-Hegelian philosophy of <em>Geist</em> that Marx superseded. Hence, Horkheimer concludes that “Mannheim distinguishes himself from those irresponsible philosophers whose blindness he claims is caused by their persistence in a "higher realm" (104) only in that he returns there himself with a few weapons from the arsenal of Marxism.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="a-critical-theory-of-ideology">A Critical Theory of Ideology</h2> <h3 id="a-negative-example">A Negative Example</h3> <p>At first glance, Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge provides us with an excellent <em>negative</em> example: that is, an example which shows us what to <em>avoid</em>. There are 3 interrelated problems with the model that one would be wise to avoid. First, Mannheim’s model posits strange metaphysical entities which should not exist by the model’s own suppositions. These entities include the appeal to a transcendental, ahistorical humanity. The theory of situational determination cannot explain the existence of such entities. The ideal type which corresponds to an ideology is another example. It putatively stands in for groups of flesh and blood people. Yet this entity stands over and above the conceptual schema that said flesh and blood people use in everyday life.</p> <p>This is due to a second pitfall with the model, Mannheim’s attempt to give a value-free analysis of ideology <em>causes</em> him to rely on such metaphysical entities. The net result of this is that, despite its scientific pretensions, the sociology of knowledge <em>loses</em> explanatory power when compared to a less metaphysically cumbersome theory. This is most notable with the pseudo-normative concept of utopia. A utopian ideology is a state of mind which “is incongruous with the state of reality within which it occurs.”<d-footnote>Karl Mannheim, *Ideology and Utopia: An Introduction to the Sociology of Knowledge* (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979), 173. Annoyingly, despite Louis Wirth being involved in both this translation and the translation used in the Horkheimer translation, the pagination is different.</d-footnote> Describing an ideology as utopian runs into one of two problems. Either it is circular, as appropriateness to the era is the “basis upon which the theory [of utopia] is to be judged,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept," 148.</d-footnote> or it posits a temporal appropriateness as some entity which stands <em>outside</em> situational determination. If the latter is the case, then the theory of utopia must rely on a concept of ‘ ”nonideological” correctness:’<d-footnote>Ibid., 147.</d-footnote> an entity which the theory says cannot exist, as such an entity would have to stand <em>outside</em> situational determination.</p> <p>The concept of utopianism falls prey to a third problem with the theory. That the quasi-normative description of utopianism does not solve the previous problem because Mannheim adds the normative concepts <em>post hoc</em>. Hence, the concept has no grounding in the theory itself. The extent to which utopianism <em>is</em> a normative concept is unclear. By reducing ideology to a cognitive framework, Mannheim reduces utopianism to a mere epistemic fault.</p> <p>What would a critical theory of ideology that avoids these pitfalls look like? Remarkably like that of the early Frankfurt School. Thus, what follows is a sketch of the critical theory of ideology as present in the <em>Institut für Sozialforschung</em> during its heyday in the 1930s, a sketch which avoids the pitfalls of the sociology of knowledge.</p> <h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3> <p>At this juncture, one must distinguish between two interwoven but nonetheless distinguishable tasks that any critical theory of ideology must provide. On the one hand, it must provide an <em>Ideologietheorie</em>: a theory of how ideologies function and the role they play in larger social structures. On the other hand, it must provide an <em>Ideologiekritik</em>: it must show that the ideologies in question obscure or render unintelligible some facts of social life. The received wisdom regarding the Frankfurt School is that it had the latter but lacked the former. This received wisdom is false, as it ignores the way in which both concepts are intertwined for the first generation of Critical Theorists. In what follows, I show that the Frankfurt School’s development of an <em>Ideologietheorie</em> is rather quite prominent, so long as one knows where to look. In particular, the Frankfurt School’s functionalism places ideology within the context of capitalist social relations. Afterward, I show that the Frankfurt School’s <em>adjectival</em> conception of ideology provides the critical half of the equation, giving ideology an <em>obfuscatory</em> role regarding immanent contradictions in social relations.</p> <p>A few words on what constitutes a critical theory of ideology are in order. The <em>critical</em> element is not vacuously filled by any subjection of assumptions to scrutiny. Indeed, this element is ostensibly part of the most vulgar bourgeois critiques of ideology that emerged during the early modern period, i.e., the ascendent era of capitalism in Europe. However, the articulation of ideology critique in capitalist society both then and now is class-based, as Horkheimer notes that “the criticism of the system [of relations that reproduce capitalist social life] is to be the prerogative of those who have an interest in it.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Concerning Resentment" from *Dawn &amp; Decline* (New York: The Seabury Press, 1978), 31.</d-footnote> Criticism in the bourgeois sense is counterposed to <em>resentment</em>, which is reserved to those “who have the opportunity to know [capitalism’s] underside.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Bourgeois thought in its skeptical form is welcoming toward criticism, so long as “critical tendencies [are] voiced only toward fantasies—so-called ideologies—and not at all toward things as they are.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Montaigne and the Function of Skepticism" from *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 296.</d-footnote> This renders criticism impotent as it considers theory as “relative and separate from praxis.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This impotence stems from a misconception about the relationship between ideology and materialism: “the foundation of authoritarian domination lies not in the delusions with which it rationalizes itself, but in the social structure of production that rules the age and shapes of the character of human beings according to their place within it.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Hence, for the Frankfurt School, <em>Ideologiekritik</em>, and by extension the critical theory of ideology, is not a mere intellectual exercise, but a task that exposes the immanent contradictions of bourgeois thought for its supersession.</p> <p>But in raising this point about the nature of criticism, I have inevitably stumbled across the question of <em>methodology</em>. After all, if the mere academic exercise of exposing illusions does not suffice for a critical theory of ideology, what other steps are necessary? As we have seen, Mannheim’s conception of social determination is too abstract and imprecise to function as a starting point. To that end, the following section explains the methodological principles which the Frankfurt School uses in its quest.</p> <h3 id="non-autonomy-of-thought-from-activity">Non-Autonomy of Thought from Activity</h3> <p>Recall that one problem with Mannheim’s conception of ideology is that it is too vague and therefore allows the reader to insert their preferred theory of ideology into the account. To avoid this pitfall, one must use a different method than Mannheim’s, lest it fall prey to the very same indeterminate metaphysical entities one should do away with. Hence, as a matter of method, one must stress the <em>non-autonomy of thought</em> from activity. The oft-quoted Marxist claim that “legal relations as well as the forms of state [...] have their roots in the material conditions of life”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, "Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1978), 4.</d-footnote> extends to the origin of ideology as well. This does not imply that such material relations are <em>a priori</em> concrete and immediately accessible to the investigator. Such material conditions are only uncovered <em>after</em> engaging in dialectical investigation. To fail to conduct such an investigation leaves the putative material relations overly abstract and insufficiently determinate. Marx’s methodological criticism of the classical political economy is relevant:</p> <blockquote> <p>“It seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete, with the real precondition, thus to begin, in economics, with e.g. the population, which is the foundation and the subject of the entire social act of production. However, on closer examination this proves false. The population is an abstraction if I leave out, for example, the classes of which it is composed. These classes in turn are an empty phrase if I am not familiar with the elements on which they rest. E.g. wage labour, capital, etc. These latter in turn presuppose exchange, division of labour, prices, etc. For example, capital is nothing without wage labour, without value, money, price etc. Thus, if I were to begin with the population, this would be a chaotic conception [<em>Vorstellung</em>] of the whole, and I would then, by means of further determination, move analytically towards ever more simple concepts [<em>Begriff</em>], from the imagined concrete towards ever thinner abstractions until I had arrived at the simplest determinations. From there the journey would have to be retraced until I had finally arrived at the population again, but this time not as the chaotic conception of a whole, but as a rich totality of many determinations and relations.”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Grundrisse* (London: Penguin Classics, 1993), 100.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Moving from the concrete to the abstract uncovers the abstract relations which govern the (previously empty, formalistic) concreta, but these abstract relations in turn can only attain validity <em>on the basis of an investigation of definite material social relations</em>. Consequently:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many determinations, hence unity of the diverse. It appears in the process of thinking, therefore, as a process of concentration, as a result, not as a point of departure, even though it is the point of departure in reality and hence also the point of departure for observation <em>Anschauung</em> and conception.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 101.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Within the abstracta that one uncovers via this process is the seed of the social relations which give it its validity. For instance, “the simplest economic category, say e.g. exchange value, presupposes population, moreover a population producing in specific relations; as well as a certain kind of family, or commune, or state, etc. It can never exist other than as an abstract, one-sided relation within an already given, concrete, living whole.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>One therefore returns to the concrete, but this time as a set of concrete relations which are the <em>result</em> of dialectical investigation and not dogmatically assumed. These concrete facts are <em>social</em> in nature, as the asocial conception of a human essence is one which treats sensuous activity as if it were mere contemplation.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: Norton &amp; Co., Inc., 1978), 145, §VI.</d-footnote></p> <p>Another advantage of Marx’s dialectical method is that it not only avoids the problems of the overly abstract and indeterminate methodology of Mannheim, but also the overly specific and asocial methodology which ostensibly lies in contraposition to it. Bukharin notes that nearly every economic figure associated with the Marginal Revolution argues for the subjective theory of value using examples of isolated atomic individuals and then presuming that such examples scale up to a social level.<d-footnote>Nikolai Bukharin, *Economic Theory of the Leisure Class* (New York: International Publisher, 1927), 42.</d-footnote> This Hobbesian model, on which the functioning of the whole is wholly reducible to the functioning of the constituent parts is unjustified because man is a <em>zoon politikon</em> and not Robinson Crusoe, and consequently a society is more than a mere aggregation of Robinson Crusoes. The economic effects of the inherent sociality of humanity are that the picture of society that positivists like the Marginal Economists depict is not only incorrect, but <em>precisely</em> <em>backward</em>, as Bukharin argues:</p> <blockquote> <p>Society (as is consciously or unconsciously assumed) is not an arithmetical aggregate of isolated individuals; on the contrary, <em>the economic activity of each specific individual pre-supposes a definite social environment in which the social relation of the individual economies finds its expression</em> [emphasis mine]. The motives of the individual living in isolation are entirely different from those of the “social animal” (<em>zoon politikon</em>). The former lives in an environment consisting of nature, of things in their pristine simplicity; the latter is surrounded not only by “matter” but also by a peculiar social milieu. The transition from the isolated human to society is possible only by way of the social milieu. And indeed, if we were dealing only with an aggregate of individual economies, without any points of contact between them, […] there would be no society. Of course, it is theoretically quite possible to embrace a number of isolated and remote economies in a single conception, to force them into a “totality” as it were. <em>But this totality or aggregate would not be a society</em> [emphasis mine], a system of economies closely connected with each other with constant interaction between them. While the former aggregate would be one we had artificially constructed, the second is one that is truly present. Therefore the individual economic subject may be regarded only as a member of a social economic system, not as an isolated atom.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Individualistic models of social science à la Hobbes and Böhm-Bawerk therefore create a false totality that does injustice to <em>both</em> the particular <em>and</em> the general. But the excursus on the Marginal Revolution shows us a second problem with extant attempts to unite social sciences under the banner of philosophy: namely, that different social sciences embrace mutually exclusive philosophical assumptions and methodologies.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 8.</d-footnote> That the assumptions and methodologies are useful within a specific field does not take away from the fact that these assumptions seem impossible to reconcile into a totality. For example, while mainstream economics embraces an individualistic methodology that privileges the particular individual over social processes as a whole, the opposite problem occurs in some branches of sociology which rely on ideal types of groups of individuals that do not cleanly correspond to flesh and blood individuals.<d-footnote>Recall that this is one problem with Mannheim's sociology of knowledge.</d-footnote> For instance, one finds in Émile Durkheim’s seminal work on suicide a methodology that proceeds <em>from</em> the general <em>to</em> the particular: a methodology totally repugnant to the individualistic methodology of economics. Differences in the types of suicides are fleshed out in terms of their causes, i.e., the “social conditions responsible for them.”<d-footnote>Émile Durkheim, *Suicide*, trans. John A. Spaulding and George Simpson (London: Routledge Classics, 2002), 99.</d-footnote> Specific instances of suicide correspond with more or less fidelity <em>to</em> the ideal types, since the object of analysis is the “<em>social</em> suicide-rate [emphasis mine].”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Thus, contra the method of economics<d-footnote>As well as the tendency toward isolated thought experiments in analytic philosophy, though such a method only blossomed well after the period of time under consideration in this essay.</d-footnote> “[t]he social rate must be taken directly as the object of analysis; progress must be from the whole to the parts.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 100.</d-footnote></p> <p>A methodology like that of Marx, one which searches for the material social relations which lie immanent in the abstracta of a given ideology, is necessary for a critical theory of ideology. By investigating the dialectic between ideology and material relations, we also solve the problem of the disconnect between ideology as such and its bearers in Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge, that is, a gap between “the mundane struggles of everyday historical life, and <em>next to them also</em> the conflicts of the ‘systems of <em>Weltanschauungen</em>.’ ”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "A New Concept of Ideology?," 145.</d-footnote> Without the dialectical critique of ideology in material social relations, the whole concept of situational determination becomes metaphysically strange and lacking in any explanatory power.</p> <p>Moreover, while Mannheim’s attempt to give a value-free conception of ideology has a scientific veneer, his eschewing of the normative side of ideology requires a strict fact/value distinction which itself is unscientific. This division is a common problem to scientific inquiry of the time, especially of positivism. As Horkheimer notes in “Notes on Science and the Crisis,” scientific inquiry does not stand outside the “dynamisms of history,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis," in Critical Theory: Selected Essays, trans. Matthew J. O'Connell and others (New York: Continuum Publishing Co., 2002), 3.</d-footnote> and thus the cleavage between “theory and action is itself a historical process.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 4.</d-footnote> Scientific inquiry, including the Mannheimian sociology of knowledge, is in the grasp of two contradictions:</p> <blockquote> <p>“First, science accepts as a principle that its every step has a critical basis, yet […] the setting of tasks, lacks a theoretical grounding and seems to be taken arbitrarily. Second, science has to do with a knowledge of comprehensive relationships; yet, it has no realistic grasp of that comprehensive relationship upon which its own existence and the direction of its work depend, namely, society.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 7.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Underlying both these problems is the need for science to be directed by “the necessities of social life,”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> viz., the necessities of <em>capitalist</em> social life, which takes as a presupposition the division of labor. Returning to Mannheim, we see that the insistence that the sociology of knowledge stands <em>above</em> specific total conceptions of ideology imbues it with a false totality insofar as it does not ground the predominance of these ideologies in social relations. On this point, it is unsurprising that there is a degree of affinity between Mannheim and the Neo-Kantians of the Marburg School, both of whom insist that “everything about the object is reduced to conceptual determinations, [and hence] the end-result of such theoretical work is that nothing is to be regarded as material and stable.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Traditional and Critical Theory" from *Critical Theory: Selected Essays,* trans. Matthew J. O'Connell and others (New York: Continuum Publishing Co., 2002), 198.</d-footnote> We have, then, a totality, but a false and empty one.</p> <p>One material relation that undergirds this intellectual fragmentation is the division of labor in capitalist societies. Here, Lukacs’ work on reified consciousness presaged later critiques of scientific inquiry by the Frankfurt School. The mere fact that there are psychological implications of commodity fetishism is obvious. After all, it involves misperceiving the social relations of labor as “an objective character stamped upon the product of that labor”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Capital* (Hertfordshire: Wordsworth Editions Limited, 2013), 47.</d-footnote> while the objects <em>themselves</em> appear in the social relations of the value-form. The results of such a process is that objectivity and subjectivity get inverted; the world of commodities, as Lukacs notes, “confront [man] as invisible forces that generate their own power”<d-footnote>Georg Lukacs, *History and Class Consciousness*, trans. Rodney Livingstone (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1971), 87.</d-footnote> while <em>subjectively</em> “a man’s activity becomes estranged from himself, it turns into a commodity which […] must go its own way independently of man just like any consumer article.”<d-footnote>Ibid. Also note that *HCC* was published *before* the publication of the 1844 Manuscripts!</d-footnote> <em>Pace</em> concerns about conflating the Taylorist and Fordist mode of capitalist production of the early 20^th^ century with contemporary, putatively “post-Fordist” production, one may still identify the throughline of rationalization and specialization: viz., the breaking down of the productive process “into abstract, rational, [specialized] operations so that the worker loses contact with the finished product and his work is reduced to the mechanical repetition of a [specialized] set of actions.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 88.</d-footnote> This implies a second process: that of converting labor time “from a merely empirical average figure to an objectively calculable work-stint that confronts the worker as a fixed and established reality.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> The psychological consequence of this process is that even the worker’s “psychological attributes are separated from his total personality and placed in opposition to it so as to facilitate their integration into specialised [sic] rational systems and their reduction to statistically viable concepts.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>Why assume intellectual labor is any different? The mere fact that there <em>is</em> an intellectual division of labor is mundane, but leads to profound consequences. The intellectual division of labor leads to an isolation of specialized fields from one another, which in turn limit their utility and scholarly output. Buck-passing on matters of fact leads some disciplines (especially in the social sciences) to uncritically accept the object of their investigation, weakening the overall scientific value of the endeavor. But this uncritical acceptance <em>also</em> distorts the goals of scientific inquiry. For Horkheimer,</p> <blockquote> <p>“A conception [of theory] is needed which overcomes the one-sidedness that necessarily arises when limited intellectual processes are detached from their matrix in the total activity of society. In the idea of theory which the scholar inevitably reaches when working purely within his own discipline, the relation between fact and conceptual ordering of fact offers a point of departure for such a corrective conception. The prevailing theory of knowledge has, of course, recognized the problem which this relation raises. The point is constantly stressed that identical objects provide for one discipline problems to be resolved only in some distant future, while in another discipline they are accepted as simple facts.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Traditional and Critical Theory," 199.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Hence, what makes something ideological is not <em>just</em> a question of the researcher uncritically accepting the object of analysis (thought that is <em>part</em> of the formulation). Rather, ideology <em>also</em> required that the aims of investigation also determined by entities other than the researchers themselves. The researcher is not a Kantian agent who can set their own hypothetical ends, but rather a part of a capitalist process who must subordinate these ends. This subordination may be <em>immediate</em>, in the case where one subordinates the ends of research to one’s boss or research and development board, or <em>mediately</em> via attempts to reify one’s consciousness (as occurs when one chases academic trends rather than pursue one’s self-selected goals).Both the input <em>and</em> the output of intellectual research are determined in scientific inquiry. Social totality determines <em>both</em> the object of analysis and the researcher as subject, both of which determine the aims. Social totality <em>needs</em> to be taken into account. I shall henceforth refer to the two ways in which social totality determines intellectual activity (that is, it both determines the object of analysis, which the researcher must uncritically accept, and the <em>telos</em> toward which the activity aims) as <em>double determination</em>.</p> <p>One of two consequences follow from this intellectual division of labor. Either scholars must content themselves with the role that the division of labor provides for them, in which case many questions worth investigating are left unanswered,<d-footnote>See, *inter alia*, Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, Inc., 2014), 6.53, p. 107-8.</d-footnote> or one must engage in blind speculation beyond the limits of one’s discipline. Consequently, we see in both “Traditional and Critical Theory” as well as “Notes on Science and the Crisis” that the intellectual division of labor is the ultimately determining grounds for limitations in thought. To return to Mannheim, then, we see another error in the sociology of knowledge: viz., that it proceeds <em>from</em> the particular <em>to</em> the total conception of ideology. While, for Mannheim, the total conception of ideology flows <em>from</em> the development of the particular concept of ideology, Lukacs shows us that the individual <em>psychological</em> characteristics which constitute a particular conception of ideology are the <em>result</em> of, in the final analysis, the capitalist division of labor, while Horkheimer shows that this analysis <em>also</em> applies to reified academic pursuits. This leads, in turn, for social scientists to fall prey to double determination, and requires the imposition of strange metaphysical entities to do the explanatory work. We now have a basic methodological schematic for investigating ideology. What remains is to uncover <em>how</em> things are determined via ideology.</p> <h3 id="functionalism">Functionalism</h3> <p>The <em>Ideologietheorie</em> of the Frankfurt School finds its most fleshed out form when investigating the self-conception of the so-called “early modern” thinkers who represented the nascent bourgeoisie contra decadent feudalism. This is because thinkers like Machiavelli and Hobbes were the first to broach the subject of ideology, that is, the question of “how the social situation relates to the prevailing ideas that come to be recognized as false.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History" in *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 361.</d-footnote> Yet the approach that especially the latter undertook rendered such an investigation fruitless for two reasons, per Horkheimer. First, for liberal theorists, the term “ideology” merely refers to the inverse of Reason.<d-footnote>Ibid., 361.</d-footnote> This juxtaposition is itself historical, as “the material and intellectual development of the preceding periods as a necessary prerequisite for the Enlightenment.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Were Enlightenment able to self-reflect on its own temporal ascendence, the rigidity of the distinction would vanish. This is a point that even the mature Horkheimer and Adorno stress in <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>; viz., that despite Enlightenment’s pretense of liberating humanity from the “self-incurred immaturity”<d-footnote>Immanuel Kant, \"An Answer to the Question: What Is Enlightenment?\" in *Toward a Perpetual Peace and Other Writings on Politics, Peace, and History*, (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2006), 17, 8:35.</d-footnote> of myth, it was incapable of grasping that Enlightenment “entangles itself […] in mythology.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, *Dialectic of Enlightenment,* trans. Edmund Jephcott (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2002), 8.</d-footnote> Second, the methodological individualism of thinkers like Hobbes, who conceive of the state as explicable “in terms of the properties of its smallest constitutive parts, namely human beings,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History," 339.</d-footnote> prevent the theory from having any explanatory power in the realm of social science. Here, Mannheim’s situational determination <em>at least</em> has the advantage of having the <em>pretense</em> of sociality built into the model.</p> <p>For Horkheimer, ideology is not merely an individual falsehood, but has a “specific function in social struggle.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 314.</d-footnote> It is therefore a <em>functionalist</em> concept rather than a mere metaphysical entity or moral-political judgment about the pathological nature of action or thought. While emphasizing the primacy of the social may lead to worries about how such social entities are grounded, unlike Mannheim, Horkheimer recognizes that the social nature of ideology is explicable in terms of the sensuous material activity that societies engage in:</p> <blockquote> <p>The predominant ideas of an epoch have roots that go deeper than the ill intentions of certain individuals. Such ideas are endemic to a given social structure, whose outlines are given by the way in which individuals sustain themselves at the time. The basic process whereby primitive hunters or fishermen secure their existence dictates not only their material mode of life, but in a certain sense their intellectual horizon as well. Similarly, the form of life based upon this primitive level of development not only conditions the actual life of the individuals, but also has a significant influence on their knowledge of the external world, as well as on the content and structure of their general understanding of life. The same point applies to more differentiated forms of society: <em>the intellectual life of individuals is bound up with the life process of the social body of which they are a part and which determines their activity</em> [emphasis mine].<d-footnote>Ibid., 360.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Ideology, then, is <em>not</em> a precondition for agency or group formation, but rather the <em>result of a material social process</em>. However, it is a result which subsequently serves as a presupposition of the social process in a dialectical manner. To conflate ideology, i.e., a <em>result</em> of the process of social activity, with the activity itself, is to make a category error. There is a whiff of more traditional Marxism in this account:</p> <blockquote> <p>it is impossible to understand the content or nature of peoples intellectual makeup without knowledge of the epoch in which they live, or indeed (leaving the primitive peoples aside) without knowing the specific position they occupy in the social production process. The vital functions necessary to sustain and further human existence have not been combined within every single individual since the time of the primitive hunters and fisherman; rather, such functions are distributed amongst the various groups within society. But this also entails the differentiation of the whole of thought [<em>geistige Leben</em>], which develops internal contradictions.<d-footnote>Ibid., 361.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>More orthodox strands of Marxism would mostly concur that one cannot understand one’s intellectual makeup without understanding their position in class relations. However, this is a <em>weaker</em> claim than the Vulgar Marxist conception of <em>strict</em> reflection theory. This weakening of the Vulgar Marxist view allows Horkheimer’s view to escape historical relativism, as “[t]he relativity of a proposition and ideology are two rather different sorts of things. The limits to what may be [sic] rightly be called ideology are constantly set by our current state of knowledge.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 362.</d-footnote> Ideological falsehood is not falsehood simpliciter, but a specific type of falsehood defined on the basis of function.</p> <p>Given that the Frankfurt School thinks that ideology is the result of a social process, one might rightly ask <em>what</em> function gives rise to ideology. Here, the notion of ideology as <em>false</em> and <em>obfuscatory</em> comes to the fore. In “Notes on Science and the Crisis,” Horkheimer sketches out the way in which earnest attempts to ascertain the truth may still count as ideological insofar as they obfuscate the true nature of society:</p> <blockquote> <p>Not only metaphysics but the science it criticizes is ideological, in so far as the latter retains a form which hinders it in discovering the real causes of the crisis. To say it is ideological is not to say that its practitioners are not concerned with pure truth. Every human way of acting which hides the true nature of society, built as it is on contrarieties, is ideological, and the claim that philosophical, moral, and religious acts of faith, scientific theories, legal maxims, and cultural institutions have this function is not an attack on the character of those who originate them but only states the objective role such realities play in society. Views valid in themselves and theoretical and aesthetic works of undeniably high quality can in certain circumstances operate ideologically, while many illusions, on the contrary, are not a form of ideology. The occurrence of ideology in the members of a society necessarily depends on their place in economic life; only when relationships have so far developed and conflicts of interest have reached such an intensity that even the average eye can penetrate beyond appearances to what is really going on, does a conscious ideological apparatus in the full sense usually make its appearance. As an existing society is increasingly endangered by its internal tensions, the energies spent in maintaining an ideology grow greater and finally the weapons are readied for supporting it with violence.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis" from *Critical Theory*, 7-8.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>That ideology obfuscates the immanent contradictions in society does not entail that one may simply dispel ideological illusions via shining a light upon it. Contra later Critical Theorists who insist on ideal discursive conditions, ideology is not <em>merely</em> illusion, and hence no number of exhortations to the truth can suffice to remove it.<d-footnote>I'm thinking predominantly of Habermas here. For an evisceration of Habermas' theory of communicative action, see Raymond Geuss, "A Republic of Discussion: Habermas at ninety," *The Point*, 18 June 2019, &lt;https://thepointmag.com/politics/a-republic-of-discussion-habermas-at-ninety/&gt;</d-footnote></p> <p>Ideologies may function well in their role, but like other machines, can break down and cease to function. When ideologies break down, not all its adherents jump ship. Rather, when the ideological superstructure and its requisite institutions falter or no longer can no longer play their role in the reproduction of society, those who benefit from the prevailing social order remove the mask of liberal humanitarian reasoning to reveal the hideously fiendish face of brutality beneath it. Or, as Horkheimer notes in <em>Dawn and Decline</em>, “[t]he less stable necessary ideologies are, the more cruel the methods by which they are protected.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Dawn" from *Dawn &amp; Decline*, 17.</d-footnote> The rise of fascism in the 30s, and the ever-growing threat of an eerily similar authoritarian capitalism today, show that the Enlightenment flickers as it falls prey to its own mythos, leaving behind only ash and soot, a testament to its spent potential. The revelation that the myth of Enlightenment was not an eternally valid truth, but a construction which displaced earlier myths, causes monopoly capital to put less weight on it and more weight on repression, just as someone who injures their right leg places more weight on their left.<d-footnote>Such a distinction presages Althusser's distinction between the Repressive State Apparatus and Ideological State Apparatuses by over a generation. See Louis Althusser, *On Ideology* (London: Verso Books, 2020), 15-22.</d-footnote></p> <p>If ideology is functional, <em>where</em> is this functionalism? The answer is that it lies in human action and thought. To that end, the following section lays out the <em>obfuscatory</em> function that ideology plays in hiding the immanent contradictions of bourgeois society.</p> <h3 id="an-adjectival-not-a-nominal-account-of-ideology">An Adjectival, Not a Nominal Account of Ideology</h3> <p>As we have seen, the concept of ideology is <em>not</em> an abstract metaphysical entity like a <em>Weltanschauung</em>, but a <em>functionalist process</em>. Rather than stipulate ideology as abstracta à la Mannheim, the Frankfurt School treats ideology as <em>adjectival</em>. That is, to paraphrase Herr Morain, for the Frankfurt School, ideology is false consciousness, with an emphasis on <em>false</em> and not on <em>consciousness</em>. That ideology is conceived of as falsehood is not unique to the Frankfurt School, obviously, but what separates the IfS is its recognition that there is a moment of truth in ideology and in all thought. This subsection traces the causal chain that gives rise to ideological distortions, starting from its most abstract components toward a more determinate answer based in the capitalist mode of production itself.</p> <p>The aforementioned paragraph from “Notes on Science and the Crisis” shows that ideology is not bullshit in Harry Frankfurt’s sense: that is, speech which is unconcerned with the truth whatsoever.<d-footnote>See Harry G. Frankfurt, *On Bullshit* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005), 47-62.</d-footnote> This is a point at which Horkheimer and Mannheim are in agreement. Both think that ideology is neither actively deceitful nor unconcerned with the truth. This point is worth mentioning since careless theories of ideology often reduce the concept to either bullshit or deception. Rather, for Horkheimer, many well-intentioned intellectual programs become ideological because they unintentionally obscure the immanent contradictions within society. Intellectual programs of this type abound, many of which fall prey to double determination. Indeed, this is a recurrent problem with positivism of all stripes.</p> <p>But why does science in the capitalist epoch tend toward ideological obfuscation? If ideology is neither bullshit nor malicious falsehood, then one may rule out the Vulgar allegedly-Marxist theory that it is merely a matter of bourgeois self-interest to deceive the masses. Theories that rely on conspiratorial deception are themselves non-Marxist, as they attribute agency to the putative Great Men of History instead of the masses engaged in antagonistic economic social relations. Rather, focusing on why this paragraph on ideology appears in “Notes on Science and the Crisis” is elucidatory. The rest of the essay contains a theme that returns in the opening chapter of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>: the instrumentalization of reason. Speaking of scientific inquiry before 1914, Horkheimer notes that the Enlightenment program of bourgeois criticism against Scholasticism had fulfilled its task by the mid-19^th^ century.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis," 5.</d-footnote> The resultant endeavor was thus the description and classification of phenomena that did not concern itself with distinguishing the relevant from trivial. After overcoming Scholasticism, Enlightenment scientific inquiry ceased criticism, and therefore dogmatically assumed that its premises were eternal and unchanging. It thus went from being a liberating force to a conservative one, which maintains extant social relations. Consequently, the mechanistic view of science that predominated was more attuned to maintaining society as it was rather than advancing it. This led scientific inquiry to eschew questions about social progress, which in turn forced it to rely on “a set of unexplicated, rigid, and fetishistic concepts”<d-footnote>Ibid., 6.</d-footnote> rather than attending to the real “need […] to throw light on them by relating them to the dynamic movement of events.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>The root of this failure is not science itself but the social conditions which relegate it to a bureaucratic role in the day-to-day management of capital instead of rational inquiry. Scientific inquiry is in the grasp of two contradictions, as Horkheimer explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>First, science accepts as a principle that its every step has a critical basis, yet the most important step of all, the setting of tasks, lacks a theoretical grounding and seems to be taken arbitrarily. Second, science has to do with a knowledge of comprehensive relationships; yet, it has no realistic grasp of that comprehensive relationship upon which its own existence and the direction of its work depend, namely, society.<d-footnote>Ibid., 8.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>These two contradictions are related, since both stem from a lack of investigating society. More critically, these contradictions arise <em>because</em> the economic order on which scientific inquiry depends is itself enmeshed in immanent contradictions. The reification of human activity encompasses not only the factory floor, but also the ivory tower. The division of intellectual labor has incentivized the renunciation of totality. Moreover, the <em>aims</em> of science are not its own, as science “is determined in the scope and direction of its work not by its own tendencies alone but […] by the necessities of social life as well.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> That is, capital conducts science as part of its process, and the rise of what Adorno and Horkheimer call the “administered world” shows that monopoly capital’s intimate relationship with the state plays an important role. Since the state and capital play a predominant role in the scientific crisis, “that crisis is inseparable from the general crisis.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 9.</d-footnote> Scientific inquiry that is subject to the double determination is, by that fact, ideological. But this division of academic labor is one that must be imposed upon the scientist. The forces that impose limitations on scientific inquiry have their root not in the realm of thought but in capitalist social relations. Hence, to uncover the false element in ideology we must abandon the idyllic pretensions of intellectual clarity and descend into “the hidden abode of production.”<d-footnote>Marx, *Capital*, 119.</d-footnote></p> <p>The growth of this thought is ideological insofar as it papers over the immanent contradictions within economic activity and the legal form. Yet this is not a function of malevolent actors suppressing the truth, but rather the result of Enlightenment’s ambiguous relationship with capital. The Enlightenment’s aim of liberating humanity from its superstitions may have extirpated existing myths, but in so doing it marshaled up myths of its own: those of rationalization, formalization, and regulation.<d-footnote>Horkheimer and Adorno, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, 3.</d-footnote> All that reason cannot subjugate underfoot must be committed to the flames; it is for this reason that “Enlightenment is totalitarian.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 4.</d-footnote> Alongside this standardization comes the principle of <em>equivalence</em>: bourgeois society “makes dissimilar things comparable by reducing them to abstract quantities.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> But the very moment of rationality’s domination over nature is empty. Rather than standing alongside it, man is subjected to the very Enlightenment myths which he conjured up. The unified schematic of earlier philosophical epochs proves less useful to capital than its fragmentation into sundry specialized sciences, all of which avoid the critical steps of justifying their tasks or relating them to an overall whole. In short, since the real subsumption of labor to capital is the true cause of the false and obscuring elements of ideology, one at last finds that one’s thought is not autonomous.</p> <p>If ideology is fundamentally false, then what is conversely true? Here, the concept of <em>totality</em> as the opposite of ideology is important to stress.</p> <h3 id="ideology-and-totality">Ideology and Totality</h3> <p>The concept of ideology must be counterposed to that of totality. Since ideology both obfuscates immanent contradictions in a social totality and plays a role in class struggle, totality must strip away the illusory element of ideology. But how might one go about doing this? Here, two facets of the Frankfurt School tradition provide us with the tools to overcome the overgrowth of ideology that papers over the real foundation of capitalist social relations: that of <em>interdisciplinarity</em> in the critical theory of ideology and doing <em>justice to the particular</em>. Immediately upon his ascension to the directorship of the IfS, Horkheimer stressed the need for interdisciplinary investigation to address the crisis of scientific knowledge. In his inaugural address in this capacity, Horkheimer attempted to lay out the lacunae in extant attempts at uniting disparate phenomena under the label of totality.</p> <p>Social philosophy, the discipline with which Horkheimer identified himself, requires viewing people not as autonomous, atomic individual subjects (as bourgeois philosophy since at least the time of Hobbes has done), but rather as “members of a community”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," in *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 1.</d-footnote> and consequently attempts to understand “phenomena that can only be understood in the context of human social life: […] with the entire material and intellectual culture of humanity.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Even though the withering of German Idealism spelled the dissolution of classical social philosophy, one must still look to Hegel to see how the cunning of spirit makes particular ends universal.<d-footnote>Ibid. Though of course, Hegel's argument in the *Lectures on the Philosophy of History* is bourgeois in the sense that it relies on the Smithian division of labor as a universal constant rather than a development of the capitalist mode of production.</d-footnote> While the empirical researcher must delve into the slaughter-bench of history, Hegel thought philosophy raises us to the standpoint of the owl of Minerva, providing consolation and reconciling injustices with the development of reason. The transfiguration of reality which occurs in this practice also reconciles the particular to the universal, so that one cannot fully actualize oneself in the context of a state, though the state exists as an end in itself.<d-footnote>Ibid., 5.</d-footnote> As the prestige of German Idealism decayed during the latter half of the 19th century, the metaphysics of objective spirit was replaced with a naive optimism in the pre-established harmony of individual interests and a Whig history. But this worldview proved empty, and individuals increasingly viewed the world as a medley of arbitrariness. The claim that individuals partake in the organic unity of the State, which, <em>qua</em> ethical community, is itself a part of the dialectic of history. When it went by the wayside, people saw brute facts as naked, requiring a theory to use. Even the neo-Kantians got in on the action in the late 19^th^ to early 20^th^ centuries via their attempt to show that there existed some higher realm outside the scope of positivism.<d-footnote>Ibid., 6. One may cite Hermann Cohen in the sphere of philosophy, Hans Kelsen in the legal sphere, and Mannheim in the sociological field as exemplars of this neo-Kantian approach.</d-footnote></p> <p>These social philosophies are right to articulate a supra-individual sphere, but also have shortcomings: they are still too positivistic and individualistic.<d-footnote>Ibid., 7.</d-footnote> Their insistence on this methodology forces them to rely on metaphysical abstracta (e.g., the Hegelian <em>Volksgeist</em> or the various false assumptions that economists have always made) that render the theory unable to explain distinctively <em>social</em> phenomena. One further complication is that there are often mutually exclusive methodologies <em>within a given scientific domain</em>. As Marx notes, what separates classical political economy from its Physiocratic predecessors is in part a methodological difference: while the Physiocrats focused on a concrete example of labor (viz., agricultural labor), Smith’s advance consists in throwing out “every limiting specification of wealth-creating activity”<d-footnote>Marx, *Grundrisse*, 104.</d-footnote> to the abstract universality of labor as such. To repeat a theme from Section 3.3, <em>only</em> a dialectical approach of the kind that Marx outlines in the <em>Grundrisse</em> can overcome the antinomy between the overly reductive individualistic approach of early bourgeois philosophy and the overly abstract and indeterminate approach of Mannheim and Durkheim.</p> <p>The crisis of the social sciences has its origin in the division of labor that makes the social sciences possible in the first place. In particular, the strict bifurcation of empirical social research and social philosophy renders both worse off than uniting the two via a dialectical continuum. The heart of this dialectical relation is one of interdisciplinarity: “the task is to […] pursue […] larger philosophical questions on the basis of the most precise scientific methods, to revise and refine their questions in the course of their substantive work, and to develop new methods without losing sight of the larger context.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 9-10.</d-footnote> Philosophy must give empirical work its animating impulses but also must be left open to be changed by its results. Thus, there is a need to gather disparate fields together in collaboration to pursue the questions in this dialectical fashion. Philosophical questions get integrated into scientific study; the results of such studies advance philosophical knowledge. Hence, this is a social process: a fitting one, given the social nature of the object of analysis.</p> <p>There is one remaining problem. Recall that Mannheim’s account of ideology is lacking because it is so broad that it does not do justice to the particular, as it involves placing competing worldviews in a titanic struggle over and above the political struggles that flesh and blood people undertake. Despite our best efforts, one may worry that the comprehensive critical theory of ideology sketched out here is still inadequate in this respect. The idea of totality is counterposed to ideology: totality is truth and ideology is false. Hence, we need some concept of totality to explain <em>why</em> ideology is false consciousness. This task has become more pressing given the increasing broadsides against the concept of totality in the decades since the decline of the original generation of the Frankfurt School.<d-footnote>See, e.g., Jean-François Lyotard, *The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge*, trans. Geoff Bennington and Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984).</d-footnote> Though the influence of postmodernism on the academy has waned, the initial suspicion of a unity which crushes underfoot the possibility of the creation of new game rules remains.</p> <p>Of course, critiques of totality are not new. These criticisms have been, historically, the domain of the Right and levied against <em>liberal</em> insistence on the sovereignty of reason.<d-footnote>See, *inter alia*, Joseph de Maistre, "On Divine Influence in Political Constitutions" from *Considerations on France*, ed. Richard A. Lebrun (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2006), 49-53.</d-footnote> But if we allow ourselves to dispense of the concept of totality, the critical theory of ideology becomes pallid and intellectually barren, as there is no universal metric by which one may measure the content of ideologies, as the world becomes a “medley of arbitrariness.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 3.</d-footnote> If this is the case, then there is no reason to prefer a critical theory of ideology over a Mannheimian sociology of knowledge, as both will be founded upon unstable metaphysical foundations. Without the ability to unify social scientific inquiry under one banner, we risk falling prey to those objections which state that there is simply too much knowledge for any intellectual enterprise to account for.<d-footnote>See, e.g., F. A. Hayek, "The Use of Knowledge in Society," *The American Economic Review* 35, no. 4 (Sep. 1945): 519-530.</d-footnote> On the other hand, to dogmatically assume the objective possibility of totality is to commit a grave philosophical sin, as it presumes the very conclusion it aims to establish.<d-footnote>Indeed, this is why introductions in philosophy are unphilosophical, as philosophy should progressively unfold the immanent intellectual content that lies latent inside the object of inquiry. Georg Wilhelm Fredrich Hegel, *The Phenomenology of Spirit*, ed. Terry Pinkard and Michael Baur (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 3.</d-footnote> One must subject one’s own intellectual tools to criticism before using them.</p> <p>The solution to this problem first appears in the Young Marx’s writings, which stress that criticism which contented itself with criticism of ideas was insufficient as it did not apply this analysis to concreta. This does not imply that we know material relations <em>a priori</em>, as Marx’s hitherto mentioned analysis of the method of political economy shows. To give putatively concrete entities more determinate content requires us to put concreta in the context of <em>social</em> relations, thereby giving material conditions a totality. It is for <em>this</em> reason that Marx considered all previous versions of materialism deficient; by foregoing the social and practical elements of material relations, one treats materialism as a mere object of contemplation.<d-footnote>See Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach" from *The Marx-Engels Reader*, 143.</d-footnote></p> <p>It is for this reason that the IfS’ insistence on both a theoretical and empirical element to their research as well as a collaborative work ethic allowed it to prosper, if only for a moment. The image of the bourgeois intellectual, isolated and productive, is one which is ill-suited to the task of remedying the faults with scholarly inquiry today. Its reified nature suits those with niche interests, but the academy’s self-perception as an outdated relic has some merit today. The ceaseless exhortation for academics to justify themselves belies an insecurity that they can no longer serve either capital or knowledge. In attempting to serve both masters, the modern academy has served neither.</p> <p>By contrast, Horkheimer saw fit to stress that totality is the way <em>out</em> of the intellectual crisis of our age. The crisis <em>arose</em> in the first place because disparate fields assume contradictory but useful assumptions which seem impossible to reconcile into a totality.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation," 7.</d-footnote> But not every grouping of intellectuals is up to the task. Indeed, the common criticism that the IfS set too lofty a goal for any group of intellectuals to accomplish would be a valid criticism if the aim of the group were merely to interpret the world. While this may make good material for academic self-aggrandizement, it is no way to change the world. The Institute failed not because its goal was unrealistic but precisely because the institute did not embrace its interdisciplinary and partisan nature <em>enough</em>. Interdisciplinarity can only grasp the totality once it entails not only a shared research program between intellectuals of different stripes, but <em>also</em> a shared commitment to some form of praxis. Contra later generations of critical theorists, critical theory must not be an exercise in retreating into abstraction to satiate Rawlsian hunger, as it then becomes meaningless abstracta. Rather it must be a theoretical tool which can be placed in the only group which can overcome the total reification of all life both inside and outside the academy: the international proletariat.</p> <p>At this point, the reader may wish for a concrete example of what a critical theory of ideology <em>looks</em> like, and how it is connected to the concept of totality. Luckily, Horkheimer provides us with one when analyzing the bourgeois revolutionary in his sprawling essay “Egoism and Freedom Movements.”</p> <h3 id="theory-and-critique-of-the-bourgeois-revolutionary">Theory and Critique of the Bourgeois Revolutionary</h3> <p>To fully appreciate the interwoven nature of the Frankfurtian <em>Ideologiekritik</em> and <em>Ideologietheorie</em> we must recognize that the predominant object of analysis that Horkheimer examined during the 1930s was bourgeois philosophy. Being a good historical materialist, he traces its development during the ascent of the Third Estate from the 16^th^ to 18^th^ centuries in “Egoism and Freedom Movements.” In said essay, Horkheimer’s <em>theory</em> that philosophy in the Early Modern period responds to and develops out of the rising power of the (as of yet still subordinated) bourgeoisie is intertwined with a <em>critique</em> of said philosophy as obfuscatory. This obfuscation arises not due to malevolence, but is an inversion of the <em>real</em> premises on which capitalism operates.</p> <p>At first glance, one may think that the substantive disagreements between thinkers in this period prevents a systematic analysis of philosophical thought therein. Every student of political philosophy knows that writers never tire of contrasting Hobbes the pessimist with Rousseau the optimist, of those whose view of human nature as selfish and reprobate drives them to conservatism with those whose view of human nature as virtuous and uncorrupted drives them to liberalism or anarchism.<d-footnote>See, e.g., the final chapter of Carl Schmitt, *Political Theology* (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2005). While Schmitt's contrast is with counterrevolutionary thinkers like de Maistre and anarchists like Bakunin, and not with liberal thinkers like Hobbes and Rousseau, it is a useful read insofar as it plays on the same distinction.</d-footnote> Even before Hobbes’ time, Horkheimer sees Machiavelli and More as <em>dramatis personae</em> with the roles of realist and pedagogical optimist respectively.<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements: On the Anthropology of the Bourgeois Era" from *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 49.</d-footnote> Both camps have their respective thinkers. Even Machiavelli finds a rival in his native Italy with Tommaso Campanella’s <em>Civitas Solis</em>, which emphasizes the capacity for a utopian society where reason reigns and discards all envy, property, and cause for discord.<d-footnote>Tommaso Campanella, *La città del sole* (Milano: Adelphi eBooks, 2023). &lt;https://archive.org/details/lacittadelsole0117camp&gt;</d-footnote></p> <p>Yet despite this apparent antinomy, there are points of unification between the two camps. The first is a rejection of the Aristotelian conception of value that governed previous forms of political thought in the West in favor of a view of human nature that appealed to “historical, political, and psychological analysis.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 50.</d-footnote> In so doing, both camps attempt to maintain a pretense of neutrality: a pretense that does not bear much fruit. As a type of science, political theory in this period needed an object of analysis: in this instance the isolated individual. This “unquestioned individualistic principle that regulated the relationships of owners to one another, [and] also […] the mental and instinctive barriers caused by the combination of this principle with the […] increasing differentiation of social classes”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> rendered theory in this period uncritical and dogmatic. By reducing political questions to mere questions of how Robinson Crusoes would interact, political philosophy of this type becomes ideological insofar as it papered over the differences internal to social life by reducing members of the society to interchangeable abstracta. While a Mannheimian ascription of ideal types to the two camps seems promising, one of the key differences between the Machiavellians and Moreans is one of power: those who emphasize “the aggressive […] drives of human beings indicated an interest in oppression, whereas the emphasis placed on educability […] was an expression of emancipatory tendencies.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 51.</d-footnote></p> <p>One further commonality between the camps is the condemnation of egoism and pleasure. Examples of this abound: from not only Machiavelli’s repeated insistence that a corrupt city can only stay free with great difficulty,<d-footnote>Niccolò Machiavelli, *Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio* (Milano: BUR Rizzoli, 2018), I.XVII-I.XVIII, p. 108-111.</d-footnote> but also Luther’s insistence that man’s free will can lead him away from God,<d-footnote>See Martin Luther, *Bondage of the Will*, trans. Henry Cole (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House Company, 1976), 122-7.</d-footnote> the Calvinist doctrine of total depravity, to the laws of Campanella’s City of the Sun, which treat women’s makeup and heels as capital offenses.<d-footnote>Campanella, *La città del sole*, 32. «Però è pena della vita imbellettarsi la faccia, o portar pianelle, o vesti con le code per coprir i piedi di legno; ma non averiano commodità manco di far questo, perché chi ci li daria?»</d-footnote> This distrust of egoistic behavior continues up through the victory of the Third Estate; Robespierre contrasts personal egoism to egoism which melds personal regard for love of the nation.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 53-4.</d-footnote> This undergirds his personal disgust toward corruption, which reaches its extreme during the trial of Danton.</p> <p>Yet at the same time as this development of bourgeois morality, bourgeois political economy also develops. The pre-capitalist prohibition on usury<d-footnote>St. Thomas Aquinas, "Question 78. Usury" from *Summa Theologiae*, vol. 38 (Westminster: Blackfriars, 1975), 233-254.</d-footnote> collapses from Calvin’s criticism,<d-footnote>I do not wish to overstate this point. Despite a *de jure* prohibition on usury, money lending did occur in Catholicism (e.g., the Church borrowing from the Fuggers). Additionally, Calvin is not as laissez-faire about money lending as is commonly assumed: he merely wishes to allow for money lending in *some* cases. This view is therefore less radical as it may seem, especially given the historical context. See David H. Eaton, "The Economists of the Reformation: An Overview of Reformation Teaching Concerning Work, Wealth, and Interest," *Sage Open* 3, no. 3 (July 1, 2013): &lt;https://doi.org/10.1177/2158244013494864&gt;.</d-footnote> and the rise of merchant capital gave the urban bourgeoisie an economic and political power that it had not yet seen. At first glance, it seems strange that a moral aversion to egoism develops at the same time as a general slackening of economic regulations that bound the bourgeoisie. After all, the economic aims of the individual members of the bourgeoisie are selfish at heart. What Horkheimer saw, however, is that it is <em>precisely</em> the rise of capitalism that gave rise to this ethical doctrine. The unleashing of capitalistic economic relations required restraints to keep it from running amok: this was a point that most of its advocates ceded.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 54.</d-footnote> While purely juridical and traditional restraints may have sufficed in the odd exception (e.g., Horkheimer cites 19^th^ century Britain, and perhaps one may add the U.S. of the same period), in most instances the state was necessary to guide capital. But morality qua social force (one should keep in mind that “ethics” and “morality” ultimately stem etymologically from words meaning “custom”) also helped restrain the beast. Hence, Horkheimer is correct to note that “the moralistic view of man contains a rational principle, albeit in mystified, idealistic form.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> If, as Marx and Engels note, “[t]he religious world is but the reflex of the real world,”<d-footnote>Marx, *Capital*, 53.</d-footnote> then one must add that it does not always mirror the real world, but in this instance inverts its form of appearance. The role of anti-egoistic morality in capitalist society, then, is <em>both</em> one side of an antinomy immanent to the social totality, <em>and</em> a belief system which obfuscates the <em>real</em> terms on which social reproduction occurs.</p> <p>That such a doctrine became popular as the bourgeoisie gained its footing <em>expresses</em> bourgeois social power; were there no ascendent capitalist relations, there would be no need to hammer home the critique of egoism ad nauseam. The proof of this is the inconsistency with which the espousers of this moral schema apply it to different social groups. While many of these moralists inveigh against luxury, many are reluctant to fully trust the poor. This is most prominent with Luther, whose thunderous polemic against the Peasants’ Revolt reaches almost comical proportions.<d-footnote>Martin Luther, "Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants" from *Luther's Works*, vol. 46, 55 vols. (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1967), 45-57.</d-footnote> Even Robespierre, radical though he was, is far from cordial toward the Énragés.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "Egoism and Freedom Movements," 103.</d-footnote> Moreover, this distrust expresses itself as a tolerance for egotistical striving for power–in <em>some</em> social classes. Luther’s supplication of the nobility, Machiavelli’s appraisal of Cesare Borgia, and the Jeffersonian aggrandizement of the yeoman farmer all share the willingness to overlook “the striving of the mighty for power, prosperity within sight of misery, [and] the maintenance of anachronistic and unjust forms of society.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 55</d-footnote></p> <p>This antinomy between the economic demand for competition, and therefore self-interest, on one hand, and the moral demand to eschew self-interested behavior has psychological effects on the bourgeois subject. The moral demand requires that one forgo lower pleasures for the sake of higher ones, and one is supposed to take pleasure in putatively uniquely <em>human</em> virtues.<d-footnote>Ibid., 57.</d-footnote> This requires that one also make peace with the world as it is: “[n]othing makes a person more suspect than the lack of an inner harmony with life as it happens to be.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 58.</d-footnote> All that is seen as frivolous is degraded as bestial. At the same time, the very frugality which this morality promotes is used as a means toward capital accumulation. This antinomy only becomes more outwardly expressed as capital claws its way to a position of economic dominance. For instance, Adam Smith’s valorization of thrift as the route to primitive accumulation attempts to merge the ethical and economic drives.<d-footnote>Adam Smith, *An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*, (Petersfield: Harriman House, 2007), 214-6.</d-footnote> Yet despite all the thrift and ambition of the poor man’s son, he finds in his old age that all his wealth was mere vanity.<d-footnote>Adam Smith,T*he Theory of Moral Sentiments*, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 211-2.</d-footnote></p> <p>This brief overview of the schematic of bourgeois revolutionary thought shows that Horkheimer’s account of ideology is at once both a detailed theory (which places thought in the context of the social conditions which give rise to it) <em>and</em> a <em>critique</em> of ideology (insofar as the moral system is obfuscating an immanent contradiction in bourgeois society).</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <h3 id="loose-threads-and-further-avenues-for-research">Loose Threads and Further Avenues for Research</h3> <p>There are a few loose threads that provide opportunities for further research beyond the scope of this essay. One may object that in the course of the investigation into ideology, I have remained too abstract insofar as I insufficiently investigated the material basis on which the ideological superstructure arises. In plain terms, one may argue that the critical theory of ideology is a project which aims at describing and unmasking the elements of the superstructure, but is insufficiently attentive to the matters of the economic base. One avenue for further research, then, is the application of the Frankfurt School’s critical theory of ideology to the economic relations that form the real basis of society.</p> <p>Of course, when talking about the real foundations of society, one must give a good account of how the real foundation of economic relations gives rise to the superstructure. One would find oneself in good company if one were to look to legal relations as a sort of bridge between the two, insofar as legal relations not only specify the conditions under which economic relations may be carried out, but also tie these relations to other spheres of life. Here, one should note that already by the time that Horkheimer ascended to his position as head of the IfS, Marxists of various backgrounds had criticized positivism for its uncritical approach to science. Evgeny Pashukanis rightly noted that legal positivism commits this sin when treating the legal form and its corresponding categories as eternal, unchanging essences instead of ideological categories that spring forth from the development of capitalism.<d-footnote>Evgeni B. Pashukanis, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism* (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2003), 73-85.</d-footnote> The legal form requires definite antinomies (e.g., the competing interests of different claimants) to function, as were there a unity of purpose among differing elements of a group, there would be no recourse to legal arbitration. Law, Pashukanis notes, mirrors the development of generalized commodity exchange, insofar as both are expedients “resorted to by isolated social elements in their intercourse with one another.”<d-footnote>Ibid., 134.</d-footnote> While Pashukanis is not optimistic about the ability to do away with this expedient entirely at present, the extent to which arbitration is resolved via the judiciary is historically contingent; previous modes of production relied more heavily on other means of social regulation (e.g., religious doctrine, ad hoc vigilantism). Further investigation into the legal form and its mediating role between base and superstructure, however, is a task for another day. The IfS were not primarily a group of attorneys, and hence a detailed analysis of how the legal form itself functions on ideological presuppositions (e.g., the antagonistic model of trial) is beyond the scope of the project.</p> <p>A good Marxist would rightly note that not just the legal form, but also the political economy on which it is based, has an ideological character thanks to its inability to criticize the premises which serve as foundational in its science. The net result is that said sciences lapse back into dogmatism and paper over the real fissures within bourgeois society with a false unity. Classical political economy, with its Smithian insistence in a transhistorical “certain propensity in human nature […] to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another”<d-footnote>Smith, *The Wealth of Nations*, 9</d-footnote> leads its adherents down a primrose path to an explanatory dead end when accounting for the origins of capitalism. The Smithian explanation of the origins of capital accumulation are quite individualistic.<d-footnote>Though not *entirely* individualistic, as Smith notes that landlords, for instance, have structural incentives to not engage in capitalistic economic relations.</d-footnote> For Smith, capital accumulates gradually in those who are frugal, while it fails to accumulate in spendthrifts.<d-footnote>Ibid., 216.</d-footnote> Even the poor worker may, if frugal enough, eventually may “maintain a menial servant”<d-footnote>Ibid., 214.</d-footnote> [though who would the frugal menial servant employ?] or he may waste it on vice. Even the putative extravagance of the rich man is explained as extravagance in maintaining his opulent servants<d-footnote>Ibid., 216.</d-footnote> [but would a truly frugal man not cut costs by doing their work himself?] rather than prodigality on behalf of the rich man. In so doing it reduces differences between rich and poor nations to a matter of a difference in <em>Volksgeister</em> and differences between classes as a predominantly <em>temperamental</em> difference rather than a difference in the means by which one labors. Of course, this is inverted: temperaments are not the cause of class differences, class differences incentivize differences in temperaments.</p> <p>Of course, any economist who would sully himself by deigning to read this essay (and therefore reading outside his own hallowed field) would rightly protest that Smith is outdated and that not all economics uses abductive reasoning of this type. Indeed, given the more quantitative nature of economics today and the indebtedness the field owes to the Marginal Revolution, Smith’s work is not even the same <em>type</em> of academic endeavor as that of the modern economists. Fair enough. But this does not mean that economists escape the problem of double determination. The model of <em>homo economicus</em> as a rational, self-interested agent underlies most microeconomic theories, but is itself an assumed fiction of dubious validity. Already by the turn of the 20^th^ century, bourgeois economists had criticized the view. Thorstein Veblen’s famous dismissal of the (now heterodox) Austrian School points out that not only is the view of human nature used oversimplified, but so removed from common sense views of human agency as to be useless:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains, who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact. He has neither antecedent nor consequent. He is an isolated, definitive human datum, in stable equilibrium except for the buffets of the impinging forces that displace him in one direction or another. Self-poised in elemental space, he spins symmetrically about his own spiritual axis until the parallelogram of forces bears down upon him, where upon he follows the line of the resultant. When the force of the impact is spent, he comes to rest, a self-contained globule of desire as before. Spiritually, the hedonistic man is not a prime mover. He is not the seat of a process of living, except in the sense that he is subject to a series of permutations enforced upon him by circumstances external and alien to him.”<d-footnote>Thorstein Veblen, "Why Is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science?" *The Quarterly Journal of Economics* 12, no. 4 (1898): 373-97, 389-90. https://doi.org/10.2307/1882952.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Stylistic prose aside, Veblen’s essay is instructive as it is an example of how economic models lose their explanatory power when one dares criticize its undergirding assumptions. Not only the concept of <em>homo economicus</em> but the desire-satisfaction or hedonistic theories of the good that much of microeconomics assumes is philosophically suspect. The former falls prey to an obvious Euthyphro problem while the latter fell out of favor after criticism from Robert Nozick,<d-footnote>Robert Nozick, *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (New York, Basic Books, 1974), 43-5.</d-footnote> hardly a bastion of the left!</p> <p>Despite its dubious philosophical origins, economic concepts reign supreme in areas even beyond its intended use. The rise of Law and Economics as an academic field stands out as one such area thanks to its increasingly predominant role in legal reasoning over the past several decades. The work of Richard Posner often involves porting over economic concepts to the law, and in so doing, porting over the uncritical abstractions of the field into real social relations. While a substantive critique of modern economic thought would be a fruitful endeavor, one should keep in mind that the neoclassical turn occurred decades after the collapse of the IfS, and hence a dialectical criticism of the movement is beyond the scope of the paper.</p> <h3 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks</h3> <p>I conclude by remarking on the theoretical virtues of the Frankfurtian account of ideology. Too often in contemporary theories of ideology, one sees that the author has forsaken a definite methodology, instead treating the concepts <em>ad hoc</em>. This consequently weakens the <em>Ideologietheorie</em> as the theory has no determining grounds on which it can stand. Of course, this in turn prevents the <em>critical</em> aspect of ideology critique from reaching its full force, as there is no method by which one can adjudicate the falsity of the object of investigation.</p> <p>On these matters, the Frankfurt School’s conception of ideology stands as a shining beacon which rises above the detritus of the tomes published after it. The IfS’ insistence on not accepting the given without subjecting it to critique, on the inability of bourgeois thought to adequately self-criticize, and by reiterating time and again that “it is not enough merely to correlate [...] ideas with some social group [...] [w]e must penetrate deeper and develop them out of the decisive historical process from which the social groups themselves are to be explained,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Social Function of Philosophy" from *Critical Theory*, 263.</d-footnote> the Frankfurt School stands head and shoulders above the unsystematic buffoons who came after them.</p> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Althusser, Louis. <em>On Ideology</em>.

His dialectical synthesis of Marxist historical materialism and psychoanalysis is inseparable from the collective research of the Institute in general and the work of Horkheimer in particular. In this essay I want to reconstruct Fromm’s early work and thereby show that it stands alongside the work of the doyens of the Frankfurt School in terms of both analytical poignancy and critical depth.</p> <p>The mode of presentation of this essay roughly traces a progression from the abstract to the concrete—that is, I have tried to organize it such that, after the introduction, the content of each section both presupposes and mediates/concretizes that of the preceding section(s). Therefore I begin, in Section 2 with a relatively abstract and general review of Fromm’s project and its place in the architectonic of critical theory, arguing that Fromm’s project was to theorize materialist mediations in both Marxist and psychoanalytic forms for interdisciplinary critical social theory. Following this, in Section 3 I describe three central concepts for this project of mediation—namely ‘<em>cement,</em>’ <em>the psychic structure of society</em>, and <em>ideology</em>—and how they figure into the overall structure of critical theory chez Fromm. This conceptual work then leads, in Section 4, into an account of the family as an institution which psychologically forms individuals into functional capitalist subjects. Section 5 finally comes to the upshot of the unstable nature of the mediations previously described and outlines three different crisis-tendencies that result from them. In my concluding remarks, I reflect on some limitations of Fromm’s theory.</p> <p>A little bit of biography and literature review is in order before I get to the main body of my argument. Fromm was treated rather unjustly by the other members of the Frankfurt School. Adorno never liked him; Horkheimer made Fromm his muse for a few years then promptly discarded him; Marcuse handled his theoretical disagreement with Fromm with unnecessary belligerence. The received image of the history of the Frankfurt School has been decisively influenced by the rather negative evaluations of Fromm made by Adorno, Horkheimer, and Marcuse. This negative attitude towards Fromm was maintained even through the rise of Habermasian Critical Theory, transforming from a critique of Fromm’s supposed revisionism and sociologism in Adorno and Marcuse into a critique of his alleged one-dimensional functionalism in Dahmer and Honneth, although Honneth has positive things to say about <em>Escape from Freedom</em>. Martin Jay’s <em>The Dialectical Imagination</em> (1973)—the only comprehensive history of the Frankfurt School written while most of its ‘inner circle’ was still alive and available for comment—gives Fromm his due, but in a backhanded way which makes Jay’s sympathy for the real protagonists of his story, namely Adorno and Horkheimer, very clear. Wolfgang Bonß wrote a number of important and enlightening texts on Fromm as a member of the Institute for Social Research in the late 70s and early 80s, but the picture of ‘interdisciplinary materialism’ reconstructed in these texts is somewhat narrowly Horkheimerian, and the reconstruction effort itself is constrained by a methodologically induced modesty. That is to say, these essays are confined mainly to the interpretation and extrapolation of the programmatic texts of the Institute and do not sufficiently interrogate the relation between the declared programs, the published texts supposedly fulfilling said programs, and the research practice of the Institute in general; such a narrow focus on the programmatic texts is unfortunately common to most engagements with early Critical Theory. <d-footnote>Moreover, Bonß's commitment to a Habermasian paradigm in social science, while undoubtedly contributing to the clarity and insight of his analysis on many points, created theoretical blindspots and prejudices with regard to other points, notably the question of functionalism. As for texts, I mainly have in mind his introduction to Fromm's *The Working Class in Weimar Germany* (1984), his contributions to the anthology volume *Sozialforschung als Kritik* (1982), and his article "Kritische Theorie als empirische Wissenschaft: Zur Methodologie 'postkonventioneller' Sozialforschung" (1983).</d-footnote> After Bonß’s relatively positive appraisal, Honneth brought up Fromm in <em>The Critique of Power</em> (1985) only to immediately dismiss him as a vulgar functionalist, a charge which shall be strongly challenged further down in this paper.<d-footnote>Axel Honneth, *The Critique of Power: Reflective Stages in a Critical Social Theory*, trans. Kenneth Baynes (MIT Press, 1993), 23-4.</d-footnote> Wiggershaus’s <em>The Frankfurt School</em> (1995) gives some more attention to Fromm and (thankfully) notes the unkindness with which he was treated by the likes of Adorno, Horkheimer, and Pollock, but the rather zoomed-out perspective of this book prevents any in-depth engagement with Fromm as a theoretician. Moving forward another two decades, John Abromeit’s <em>Max Horkheimer and the Foundations of the Frankfurt School</em> (2011) is probably the most just treatment of Fromm’s contributions to the Frankfurt School thus far, but it is (understandably) limited in its analysis by the focus on Horkheimer, with Fromm entering the picture mainly as a junior partner to Horkheimer. Lawrence Friedman’s biography <em>The Lives of Erich Fromm</em>, unfortunately, often misses the mark when it comes to rigorous intellectual biography: the author at one point describes critical theory as an enterprise building on “Hegel’s dialectic materialism.”<d-footnote>Lawrence Friedman, *The Lives of Erich Fromm* (Columbia University Press, 2013), 40.</d-footnote> Ultimately, the most comprehensive body of secondary literature on Fromm has come from the pen of his secretary-cum-executor Rainer Funk; his book <em>Life Itself Is an Art: The Life and Work of Erich Fromm</em> (2019) is, despite its short length, perhaps the best single overview of Fromm’s lifework as a whole. Kieran Durkin’s <em>The Radical Humanism of Erich Fromm</em> (2014) is also a strong contender for that title, however.<d-footnote>Other authors who deserve recognition for their excellent work on Fromm include Joan Braune, Daniel Burston, Neil McLaughlin, Roger Frie, Michael Thompson, and Fromm's former research partner and co-author Michael Maccoby.</d-footnote> Use of Fromm’s archive in writing on him has been sporadic; when the archive has been consulted, this has typically been done for basically biographical purposes. While the release of some previously unpublished texts such as “Die männliche Schöpfung” (1933), <em>The Working Class in Weimar Germany</em> (1937/8), and “A Contribution to the Method and Purpose of an Analytical Psychology” (1937) has shed some light on Fromm’s trajectory in this period, a number of other interesting documents have never been analyzed. In my research for this essay I found several documents in the Fromm papers at the New York Public Library that have deepened my understanding of his early work and the nature of his collaboration at the Institut für Sozialforschung. I use a number of these documents in the reconstruction that follows; the translations of these documents are all my own, and I provide the original German text in accompanying footnotes.<d-footnote>There are even a few unpublished texts and notes by Horkheimer in the NYPL Fromm papers. Due to the constraints inherent to being an independent scholar I was only able to spend about a day's worth of work going through the Fromm papers and selecting documents to scan for further close reading; undoubtedly there were some fruitful documents which I did not discover.</d-footnote></p> <p>This essay is reconstructive-reparative in aim, hence neither strictly doxographical nor critical. I have kept my critical comments and textual wrangling to the notes for the most part. The scope of the essay is confined to a relatively narrow period in Fromm’s work ranging about a decade, roughly from the article “Psychoanalysis and Sociology” (1929) to the book <em>Escape from Freedom</em> (1941). Everything written in this period was produced under the sign of the Institute for Social Research, at which Fromm was chair of social psychology from 1931 to 1939. The working environment at the Institute was intensely collaborative, and all the main members of the Institute reviewed one another’s manuscripts and theories extensively before they were finally published. According to Helmut Dubiel, “no single article appeared [in the Institute’s journal] without having been ratified by the entire [inner] Circle [of the Institute, i.e. Horkheimer, Pollock, Löwenthal, Fromm, Marcuse, and Adorno].”<d-footnote>Helmut Dubiel, *Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory*, trans. Benjamin Gragg (MIT Press, 1985), 176</d-footnote> Fromm and Horkheimer in particular enjoyed an especially close working relationship for several years in the 1930s.<d-footnote>Gunzelin Schmid Noerr divides Fromm's history with the IfS into three phases, "(1) die Phase der integralen Mitarbeit Fromms im Institut in Frankfurt, Genf und New York von 1929 bis 1935, (2) die seiner Mitarbeiterschaft unter zunehmender Entfremdung 1936 bis 1939 und (3), nach einer Phase des Schweigens, die der schriftlichen Angriffe und Gegen angriffe seit 1946, in deren Zentrum die sogenannte Kulturismus-Revisionismus Debatte mit Marcuse von 1955/56 stand." (Noerr, Gunzelin Schmid, "Warum wir so handeln wollen, wie wir handeln müssen. Erich Fromm und das Institut für Sozialforschung" in [*Fromm Forum*], 24 (2020), 42.) It is the first two phases which this paper is concerned with. A characteristic example of collaboration from their correspondence is quoted in Erich Klein-Landskron, "Max Horkheimer und Erich Fromm" in *Erich Fromm und die Frankfurter Schule*, eds. Michael Kessler and Rainer Funk (Francke Verlag, 1992), 161-163.</d-footnote> This being the case, I have decided that it is justified at points to interpret and cite Horkheimer’s work almost as if it had been written by Fromm, or rather as if both Horkheimer and Fromm were both merely mouthpieces of the collective authorship of the entire Institute. Further grounds for my reconstructive approach are to be found in the well-documented practice of self-censorship among the members of the IfS. This practice was even somewhat expanded in Fromm’s case to include partial censorship of criticism directed at Freud, as such criticism both jeopardized his standing in the International Psychoanalytic Association (he was eventually excluded from the IPA in the early 1950s) and was perceived by other members of the IfS as a politically inappropriate attack on a fellow threatened intellectual. What is the nature of the reconstruction I propose? The task is to chart a course which avoids reducing Fromm to either his early religious and traditional-sociological writings or his later existentialism-influenced work. To this end, I have chosen to read Fromm as part of the Institute for Social Research instead of using his biography as the primary framework for reading. This means that I have bracketed some major areas of his life-work, above all else his ethical thought, in the interest of focusing on Fromm’s more strictly theoretical writings.<d-footnote>I have a forthcoming essay on the rational kernel(s) of Fromm's work as a whole forthcoming in the Winter 2024/2025 issue of *Parapraxis*.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="materialist-microfoundations">Materialist Microfoundations</h2> <p>Fromm dedicated a significant portion of his 1932 essay “The Method and Task of an Analytic Social Psychology: Notes on Psychoanalysis and Historical Materialism” to refuting psychologistic interpretations of the materialist conception of history, which claimed that Marx argued all social action is directly psychologically motivated by economic interests. Some of these interpretations were from those opposed to Marxism, like Bertrand Russell, while others were from important “Marxists” themselves, such as the revisionist politician, Frankfurt professor, and future Nazi collaborator Henri de Man. Against these figures, Fromm argues that historical materialism is not at all psychologistic and involves only a handful of very basic psychological presuppositions, namely these: “<em>men</em> make their own history; <em>needs</em> motivate men’s actions and feelings (hunger and love); these needs increase in the course of historical development, thereby spurring increased economic activity.”<d-footnote>Erich Fromm, "The Method and Function of an Analytic Social Psychology," in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis* (Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1970), 150; emphasis in original.</d-footnote></p> <p>Historical materialism is not a psychologistic theory, but a number of important concepts within historical materialism have significant psychological aspects and are distorted if their psychological dimension goes unaccounted for. Fromm claims that psychoanalytic (social) psychology can explain the mediations which contribute to the reproduction of society—such as ideology—and in this way help make historical materialism a more comprehensive social theory. In modern social scientific terminology, these individual and small-scale phenomena out of which large-scale phenomena emerge are called ‘microfoundations.’ In the debates around Analytical Marxism in the 1980s, the search for microfoundations was associated with a commitment to methodological individualism and a skepticism towards functionalism. Fromm’s critical and psychoanalytic approach to social theory provides an interesting contrast, however: his training as both a Weber-influenced sociologist and a psychoanalyst resulted in a strong commitment to methodological individualism, while his subsequent conversion to Marxism resulted in an equally strong commitment to a critical form of functionalism as developed by the IfS<strong>.</strong><d-footnote>See the account of Fromm's intellectual-historical background in the German *Geisteswissenschaften* in Daniel Burston, *The Legacy of Erich Fromm* (Harvard University Press, 1991), 99ff.</d-footnote> The search for microfoundations of historical materialist critical social theory—i.e., explanations of the large-scale phenomena posited by historical materialism on the basis of the individual as conceived by psychoanalysis—was a crucial part of Fromm’s project in the 1930s.</p> <p>Microfoundations, certainly, but microfoundations of <em>what</em>? Fromm’s goal was not the production of an action theory capable of accounting for <em>all</em> social phenomena through a universal psychoanalytic account of human motivation. Indeed, the psychoanalytic approach rather militates against attempting such a daring generalization, seeing as it has its origins in the understanding and treatment of <em>specifically pathological</em> mental processes. Fromm’s goal was to analyze and establish microfoundations for a number of different institutions, relations, concepts, and so on which we can today group under the heading of <em>social reproduction</em> or, as Althusser would put it, <em>the reproduction of the relations of production</em>. (Fromm did not use the exact term ‘social reproduction,’ but the concept was used—sometimes verbatim, sometimes in so many words—by other members of the IfS (Horkheimer, Marcuse, Wittfogel, etc.) in their analyses of many of the same phenomena that Fromm focused on, such as ideology and the family.) The point is that his analyses, while playing a mediating and concretizing role in the structure of social theory overall, are still <em>somewhat</em> abstract. They lie within the domain of social theory, not purely empirically descriptive sociology.</p> <p>The psychic relations and traits which contribute to the reproduction of society (and <em>that</em> they thus contribute) are the result of a reciprocal process of adaptation between the individual psyche and social practice, with the former being in a subordinate position to the latter. The individual psyche is constructed on the foundation of unconscious drives and ‘wants’ these drives to be satisfied. Psychoanalysis, in particular the clinical part, describes a number of different “defense mechanisms” by which ‘thoughts’ (inclusive of ‘feelings,’ ‘desires,’ etc.) are worked over and transformed by the mind: repression, sublimation, transference, displacement, etc.. Anyone making use of these psychoanalytic concepts must, however, resist the temptation to reduce them to empty formulae indifferent to the ‘contents.’ The concept of repression, for example, implies that the repressed contents are in some way psychically displeasing or painful. Because repression is the foundation for the other defense mechanisms, anyone who wants to use a concept such as sublimation or displacement must connect the content of that which is sublimated or displaced back to the original pleasure/displeasure matrix of repression.</p> <h3 id="excursus-on-fromms-relation-to-freud">Excursus on Fromm’s Relation to Freud</h3> <p>Before moving forward, it is necessary to describe Fromm’s relationship to Freud during this time. He can be characterized as neither heterodox nor orthodox, maintaining the majority of Freud’s conceptual arsenal while also subtly shifting the emphasis and precise meaning of many terms. In 1936 he began to actually revise some of the fundamentals of Freudian psychoanalysis—above all else the theory of libido—and in 1937 produced an essay expounding these revisions. That essay, posthumously published in the volume <em>Beyond Freud: From Individual to Social Psychology</em> (1992), was rejected for publication in the <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> by Horkheimer. The text is interesting from an intellectual-biographical perspective because it represents a transitional stage between the half-hearted adoption of libido theory in his earlier texts and the embrace of ‘interpersonal’ psychoanalysis which strongly characterizes <em>Escape from Freedom</em> and everything afterwards. The 1937 essay is a main point of reference for my reconstruction, as it brings out the critique of Freud implicit in the earlier essays while largely maintaining the systematic coherence of orthodox psychoanalytic terminology. The replacement for libido theory in the text is a theory of <em>object relations</em>, summarized by Fromm elsewhere as being “the person’s (loving or hating) attitudes towards himself or other people he encounters; in a word, they are his emotions, feelings, and attitudes towards the surrounding world in general.”<d-footnote>Fromm, "Psychoanalytic Characterology and Its Relevance for Social Psychology," in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 166. This view of object relations is greatly broadened in comparison to Freud's narrow and fragmentary treatment of the topic. It is a shame that Fromm did not take up Adorno on his request to collaborate on an essay analyzing the psychology of women under capitalism, wherein he intended to argue that women's social position in capitalism led them to unconsciously identify with commodities---see Wolfgang Bonß, *Dialektische Psychologie* (Springer VS, 2018), 141-2.</d-footnote> With this in mind, Fromm’s use of the language of libido theory can be translated into a relational idiom with little being lost in the process.</p> <p>Sections 3 and 4 below continue the march of concretion and detail two major areas of Fromm’s work: what I have termed the ‘psychic structures of social reproduction’ and the family as a key mediating institution in the reproduction of capitalism.</p> <h2 id="psychic-structures-of-social-reproduction">Psychic Structures of Social Reproduction</h2> <p>Brute force and ‘rational’ or ‘egoistic’ interest are not sufficient to ensure the reproduction of society. Distinctively ‘psychic’ factors enter into the picture as well. Horkheimer already marked out this problem—the relation of ‘the psychic’ to the constitution and reproduction of society—as one of the main areas of investigation for the IfS in his 1931 inaugural address.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, "The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research," in *Between Philosophy and Social Science* (MIT Press, 1993), 11.</d-footnote> This section will reconstruct Fromm’s psychoanalytic characterology and his account of the ‘psychic structure of society,’ relating both to a conception of social-psychic ‘cement’ which is distinct from ideology. Ideology is assumed to be familiar already and is being analyzed in depth in an essay by Sam Thomas also in this issue. This being the case, it is treated here only very schematically, mainly to differentiate it from the other concepts and establish its relation to psychoanalysis.</p> <h3 id="cement">“Cement”</h3> <p>I begin with cement. While the metaphor of ‘social cement’ was commonplace in social science even during the heyday of the IfS, the first use of the concept in the corpus of the Frankfurt School comes from Fromm: “[the libidinal strivings of individuals] serve as the ‘cement’, [...] without which the society would not hold together, and which contributes to the production of important social ideologies in every cultural sphere.”<d-footnote>Fromm, "Method and Function" in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 158.</d-footnote> Fromm uses the adjective “libidinal” here not to define these strivings as narrowly sexual or concerned with physical pleasure, but to distinguish them from the supposedly objective or ‘rational’ interests which individuals and classes are often ascribed. In an unpublished text from 1934 titled “Die gesellschaftliche Bedeutung der Autorität in der gegenwärtige Familie” (“The Social Meaning of Authority in the Contemporary Family”), Horkheimer—perhaps with Fromm over his shoulder, given that the document ended up in Fromm’s papers—gives a more substantive definition of “cement” and sharply distinguishes it from ideology.<d-footnote>The document is technically unsigned but was almost certainly written by Horkheimer. It almost exactly mirrors the content and structure of Horkheimer's "Allgemeiner Teil" essay from *Studien über Autorität und Familie* and therefore likely represents an early, schematic outline of that work. This conclusion is further supported by the text's stylistic similarity to Horkheimer's schematic essay "Bemerkungen über Wissenschaft und Krise" in the first volume of the ZfS, which was an early draft that Horkheimer was unable to finish due to an illness. A number of other documents related to the *Studien* also ended up in Fromm's papers; see J.E. Morain, "The Origins of *Studien über Autorität und Familie*" (Critical Theory Working Group, 2024).</d-footnote> He defines ‘cement’ as “neither a purely economic moment, nor something detached from the economic base, but rather the inner content of the cultural, social, and psychic powers which work together to ensure that a determinate level of production and reproduction of economic life of human beings is maintained and accepted.”<d-footnote>Erich Fromm Papers b. 7 f. 5 / r. 8; "Die gesellschaftliche Bedeutung..." Section I.2. German original: "weder ein rein oekonomisches Moment, noch etwas von der oekonomischen Basis Losgeloestes, vielmehr Inbegriff der kulturellen, sozialen, seelischen Maechte, die in ihrem Zusammenwirken dafuer sorgen, dass eine bestimmte Stufe der Produktion und Reproduktion des oekonomischen Lebens von den Menschen festgehalten und akzeptiert wird."</d-footnote> The subsequent paragraph distinguishing ‘cement’ from ideology is worth quoting in full:</p> <blockquote> <p>[Delineation of cement from ideology.]{.underline} Ideology is false social consciousness and belongs solely to the restricting moments of a social period. Cement can indeed be a productive element, a productive force, yea, in a certain way even an explosive element, just as [it can be] conservative or limiting. There is cement in social orders in which there is no ideology. [The fact] that it has served specific class interests in all previous history, and its correlate class-character, is only one side [of the matter]. Moreover, it contains mechanisms without which we would be incapable of thinking human history.<d-footnote>Ibid, Section I.3. German original: "[Abgrenzung des Kitts von der Ideologie.]{.underline} Ideologie ist falsches, gesellschaftliches Bewusstsein und gehoert eindeutig zu den hemmenden Momenten einer geschichtlichen Periode. Kitt kann sowohl ein produktives Element sein, Produktivkraft, ja, [gewissermaessen] sogar ein sprengendes Element, wie auch konservierend oder fesselnd. Kitt gibt es auch in Gesellschaftsordnung, in denen es keine Ideologie gibt. Dass er in aller bisheriger Geschichte in wesentlichen bestimmten Klasseninteressen gedient hat, also sein jeweiliger Klassencharakter, ist nur seine eine Seite. Darueber hinaus enthaelt er Mechanismen, ohne die wir menschliche Geschichte nicht zu denken vermoegen."</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>The cement concept should therefore be interpreted as designating a <em>functional property</em> of certain psychological (and social, cultural, etc.) relations and traits which enable social reproduction, while ideology is fundamentally conceived as social <em>false</em> <em>consciousness</em>, hence as something both distinctively cognitive and limiting.<d-footnote>In "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History" (1930), Horkheimer defined the problem of ideology as that of "how the social situation relates to prevailing ideas that come to be recognized as false," also noting that the asserting that a theory is ideological requires an analysis of its social function for support---see Horkheimer, "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History," in *Between Philosophy and Social Science*, 361 and 418, respectively. Horkheimer further specifies that "[e]very human way of acting which hides the true nature of society, built as it is on contrarieties, is ideological," while stipulating that "many illusions [...] are not a form of ideology" in Horkheimer, "Notes on Science and the Crisis," in *Critical Theory*, 7. Horkheimer's early account of ideology has been neatly summarized in Stanisław Czerniak, "Three Interpretations of the 'Ideology' Category. Max Horkheimer's Conception of Ideology," *Dialogue and Universalism* 33, no. 1 (2023). It is still appropriate to say, however, that the Frankfurt School did not have a really *systematic* account of ideology in the 1930s. See Sam Thomas's essay <a href="/blog/2025/MarginNotes_1_3">On the Falsity of Prevailing Ideas</a> in this journal issue for further elaboration on and reconstruction of the Frankfurt School's concept of ideology.</d-footnote> In the interest of preserving the terminology used by Fromm and Horkheimer, then, “ideology” will here refer exclusively to ideology-qua-false-consciousness. “Cement,” is to be understood as the ‘canalization’ of human drives (“libido”) into activity (hence dispositions, individual psychic structures, etc.) which functionally serves the social process and reproduction of society. It is a <em>property,</em> not a <em>thing</em>, much in the way that the Frankfurt School developed an <em>adjectival</em> concept of ideology.</p> <h3 id="psychic-structure">Psychic Structure</h3> <p>The capitalist’s desire to accumulate, the worker’s consent to exploitation: what are we to make of these? Marx was correct to reduce concrete individuals to mere ‘bearers’ of structurally determined class-roles, but only to a certain extent. It takes a certain kind of individual who has undergone a socially determined process of psychic formation to properly fill these class-roles, execute the duties imputed to them, and, indeed, derive satisfaction from doing so. One of the basic theses of critical theory is that <em>functionalism is not a presupposition of the social process but a result of it.</em> Even ‘rational’ interests must be inculcated.<d-footnote>For example, peasants in the Middle Ages would often only engage in wage labor when forced to by conditions of social crisis and widespread poverty, even though many had free time enough to work in periods when wages were higher due to the lower labor supply. They had not been schooled in the 'laws' of supply and demand and were unresponsive to them.</d-footnote> Fromm’s analytic social psychology was, at least in part, an attempt to develop concepts suitable for the critical analysis of this process of functionalization from the specific standpoint of social psychology.</p> <p>Throughout the 1930s, Fromm’s attempt to integrate psychoanalysis and historical materialism largely turned around one specific concept, which he variously called the ‘libidinal structure,’ ‘drive structure,’ and ‘psychic structure’ of society—I will stick to using the phrase ‘psychic structure (of society)’ because it does not imply adherence to libido theory. With regards to historical materialism, Fromm conceived the psychic structure as a more or less distinct ‘level’ which existed between the economic base and cultural-political superstructure and mediated these two formations. The real meaning of the concept is more easily comprehended, however, if one considers it to be more like a ‘dimension’ of both the base and superstructure than an ‘instance’ or ‘level’ unto itself. It is in this sense that I understand the conjunction of Fromm’s claim that “the libidinal structure of a society is the medium through which the economy exerts its influence on man’s intellectual and mental manifestations” with his claim, made in the same paper, that “the realm of human drives is a natural force which [...] is an immediate part of the substructure [i.e. economic base -J.E.M.] of the social process.”<d-footnote>Fromm, "Method and Function," in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 161 and 157.</d-footnote> The psychic structure is a “medium” which is simultaneously—and dialectically—constitutive of the things which it mediates, namely the base and superstructure. In the early version of Fromm’s theory, the psychic substance of this medium consists mainly of biologically given psycho-somatic drives and their derivatives, while in the later version it consists of determinate relational orientations that are both historical and specifically psychic (as opposed to psycho-<em>somatic</em>). In both versions, the psychic structure of society has its only ‘support’ in concrete individuals and the institutions they make up; Fromm (and Horkheimer) always rejected the idea of a group-mind or collective unconscious, seeing such concepts as errors which presupposed without mediation the very thing they should have been explaining. Reconstructing Fromm’s somewhat scattered explanations, we can see the the psychic structure as being primarily articulated on three distinct levels: first, as a somewhat amorphous “character matrix” of the psychic traits and orientations which predominate in a given social formation; second, as determinate socially typical character-structures distributed more or less in accordance with the principal forms of social stratification (class, gender, race, etc.); third, as the specific character of concrete individuals that has emerged from their particular life-histories—human living being understood as a fundamentally social process.<d-footnote>According to my reconstruction, then, Fromm was correct when he claimed that his later theory of social character was in essence the same as his earlier theory of psychic structure. I must emphasize, however, that the foregoing is a reconstruction of *Fromm's* views. In my opinion, the basically characterological nature of his conception of the psychic structure of society has some limitations when it comes to understanding certain supra-individual and group phenomena.</d-footnote></p> <p>Analytic social psychology investigates not just how the economic base or infrastructure conditions psychic development, but also how the economy is “psychologically possible” in the first place when considered from the perspective of the mind and its development.<d-footnote>Fromm, "Method and Function," in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 159.</d-footnote> I give more attention to this latter problem in the below section on the family, but for now I will just mention one crucial concept for Fromm’s answer to this question: adaptation. In the early 20th century, psychoanalytic theorists developed a distinction between alloplastic and autoplastic adaptation—modification by the organism of its environment and itself, respectively. Marxist psychoanalysts like Fromm and Wilhelm Reich found that the intense social and psychic repression characteristic of class society lead to the predominance of autoplastic adaptation. In other words, the weakness of individuals leads them to consciously and unconsciously adapt their behavior and psyche to be in accord with the demands of society. This means not just that desires necessarily contrathetical to the social order are strongly repressed, but also that desires only ‘accidentally’ opposed to the social order are made more compatible via aim-inhibition, sublimation, and the like.</p> <p>One thing has to be addressed before proceeding to ideology, namely Horkheimer’s claim that “there is cement in social orders in which there is no ideology.” Fromm and Horkheimer hold out the possibility of a society in which psychic attachment to the social order is not something repressive and distorting but rather fulfilling, even pleasurable insofar as it meaningfully makes use of human potential. Fromm goes so far as to claim that “in a society where services performed for the whole society rather than property are the basis of social esteem, the same narcissistic impulses [which fuel the capitalist drive for acquisition] will find expression as a ‘drive’ to contribute to society in some important way.”<d-footnote>Fromm, "Method and Function," in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis,* 152.</d-footnote> Although their references on this point are principally to the mythical matriarchal past described (or imagined) by Johann J. Bachofen, they resonate with the forward-looking utopian visions of Charles Fourier.<d-footnote>On this point, see "The Theory of Mother Right and Its Relevance for Social Psychology" (1934) in Fromm,*The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*; "Family Sentiments" by Robert Briffault and "Robert Briffaults Werk über das Mutterrecht" by Fromm in ZfS II ; "Die männliche Schöpfung" in the *Elektronische* *Erich Fromm Gesamtausgabe*; "Authority and the Family" in Horkheimer, *Critical Theory.* Fromm---unlike Horkheimer---also looked towards Margaret Meads ethnographies of non-state societies for examples of "social orders in which there is no ideology."</d-footnote> This psychological dimension of utopia was elaborated on by the later Marcuse, as well as thinkers influenced by the Frankfurt School such as Fredric Jameson.<d-footnote>Marcuse introduced the theme in *Eros and Civilization* (Beacon Press, 1955), after which it became a hallmark of his thought; Jameson's boldest work on the topic is undoubtedly *An American Utopia* (Verso, 2016).</d-footnote></p> <h3 id="ideology">Ideology</h3> <p>For the Frankfurt School, ideology is false consciousness, and the emphasis here is on <em>false</em>, not <em>consciousness</em>. It is not, as in the work of Gramsci and many other Marxists, an ‘intermediate’ level of consciousness between immediate, commonsensical action and philosophy or science, nor is it a synonym of <em>Weltanschauung</em>. This characteristic conception of ideology has consequences for what an approach to the problem of ideology which is both psychoanalytic and critical-theoretical looks like. In this subsection, I outline the nature of such an approach and how it relates to the critique of ideology.</p> <p>A crucial distinction must be established before the relation of psychoanalytic inquiry to the problem of ideology can be described. It is the distinction between the production and reproduction of ideology which Wilhelm Reich introduced in his 1932 study of the ideology of sexual morals, <em>The Imposition of Sexual Morality</em>.<d-footnote>A translation may be found in Wilhelm Reich, *Sex-Pol: Essays 1929-1934*, ed. Lee Baxandall, trans. Anna Bostock (Verso, 2012.)</d-footnote> The production of ideology is, we can say, something specifically <em>historical</em> or <em>diachronic</em>, even if the emergence of this or that ideological current cannot be decisively attributed to any specific individual(s). The reproduction of ideology is concerned with the process by which individuals come to ‘spontaneously’ speak, think, and behave ideologically, i.e. a specific process of social reproduction which can be seen <em>synchronically</em> as part of the machinery of a given social formation. Psychoanalytic inquiry is concerned—here at least—mainly with the reproduction of ideology.<d-footnote>Fromm himself does not make the distinction and actually claims that psychoanalysis can explain the "production" of ideologies and "how the economic situation is transformed into ideology via man's drives" in Fromm, "Method and Function," in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 155, as well as 157 and 162. The essay in which he makes these claims was written, however, before the publication of Reich's book, which was later positively reviewed by Fromm in the *Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung* (ZfS II, 119ff). When Fromm uses the phrase "production of ideologies," it is clear that he is referring to the process by which they become endemic in society, not how they emerge out of an individual's mind.</d-footnote> A psychoanalytic inquiry into this process would have to analyze both the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of ideology—that is, both what functional role ideologies play at the level of society and how ideologies function at the level of the psyche (conceived, of course, as a complex drive-motivated entity which is mostly unconscious).<d-footnote>In terms of analyzing particular ideologies, Fromm spent the most of his energy in the 1930s working on bourgeois-protestant ideology; the texts "Psychoanalytic Characterology and its Reference for Social Psychology" (1932), translated in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis* and *Escape from Freedom* (1941) are the bookending examples of this decade-long research project.</d-footnote> Both of these questions, in the context of psychoanalysis, imply the necessity of going ‘beneath’ the level of ideology conceived as discursive-cognitive and investigating the socially typical (unconscious) psychic traits which form the psychic terrain, as it were, of individual socially important ‘ideologies’ and of ‘ideological’ behavior as such (which cannot always be readily identified with a particular ‘ideology’). Such a methodological distinction between the psychic basis of ideology and ideology as such does not entail an ‘ontological’ distinction between the two or a reduction of one to the other, but it must be kept in mind that the Frommian unconscious is still not so immediately political as the Deleuzo-Guattarian. <d-footnote>I say that we must not reduce one to the other, but Fábio De Maria, in De Maria, "Fromm and Horkheimer," *Fromm Forum (English Edition)* 25 (2021), 48---relaying the opinion of Helmut Dahmer in Dahmer, *Libido und Gesellschaft* (Suhrkamp Verlag 1973), 311ff---notes that Fromm seems to reduce ideology to psychology in the very first paragraph of his essay "Über Methode und Aufgabe einer analytischen Psychologie" (1932). In reality, things are not so simple. For reference, the problematic sentence in the original German runs like this: "[Psychoanalyse] hat insbesondere private und kollektive Ideologien als Ausdruck bestimmter, trieblich verankerter Wünsche und Bedürfnisse entlarvt und auch in den 'moralischen' und ideellen Motiven verhüllte und rationalisierte Äußerungen von Trieben entdeckt" (ZfS I, 28). A literal translation, with my emphasis added, would be something like this: "Psychoanalysis has, in particular, unmasked private and collective ideologies as the expression of certain desires and needs *anchored in* [unconscious] drives and discovered hidden and rationalized manifestations of the drives *in* the 'moral' and ideal motives [of these ideologies]." Fromm's 1970 translation of the offending passage, on the other hand, runs like this: "In particular, [psychoanalysis] has unmasked individual and collective ideologies as the expression of specific wishes and needs rooted in the instincts and shown that our 'moral' and idealistic motives are in some measure the disguised and rationalized expression of instinctual drives" (Fromm, *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 135). De Maria therefore relies on an interpretation of this passage which is tendentious even when checked against the original German text and, moreover, contrary to the author's own understanding of it as expressed in the later translation. Even if this singular sentence meant what De Maria claims, it would only thereby represent a contradiction within Fromm's account of ideology, not the principle of it. More generally, De Maria and Dahmer fail to register the importance of collaboration in the working process of the IfS. These authors artificially read Horkheimer and Fromm's texts from the height of their collaboration against one another instead of reading them with an eye to how they mutually reinforce one another.</d-footnote>All in all, these disciplinary and methodological factors mean that a psychoanalytic study of ideology is in important respects different from the critique of ideology as such, although both forms of investigation are able to inform one another and contribute to a systematic account of society as a totality in which disciplinary boundaries ultimately dissolve.</p> <h3 id="the-family-as-mediator">The Family as Mediator</h3> <p>In this section I review the complex mediations described by Fromm which make the family a (if not <em>the</em>) decisive influence on the psychic development of individuals and the primary agent of socialization. The family was a central object of research for the IfS in the 1930s, and Fromm was arguably the leading force in this research effort.</p> <p>From his first essay in the <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> onwards, Fromm makes a decisive break with Freud on the question of the family. Freud’s speculative psychohistory conceived the history of humanity as the eternal return of the Oedipal family, raising the Oedipus complex to the level of an ultimate meaning and reducing society to a mirror of the Oedipal triangle. Fromm, however, rejects this absolute prioritization of the family and conceives it as an institution which is determined by social factors and therefore transmits a ‘meaning’ which is fundamentally social. Thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>Of course, the first critical influences on the growing child come from the family. But the family itself, all its typical internal emotional relationships and the educational ideals it embodies, are in turn conditioned by the social and class background of the family; in short, they are conditioned by the social structure in which it is rooted. […] The family in the medium through which the society or the social class stamps its specific structure on the child, and hence on the adult. <em>The family is the psychological agency</em> [<em>Agentur</em>; agent in the sense of personal representative -J.E.M.] <em>of society</em>.<d-footnote>Fromm, "Method and Function," in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 142.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>The family is the <em>active agent</em> through which ‘social contents’ are transmitted and mediated to the individual psyche in formation (i.e., during childhood): “The family is the essential medium through which the economic situation exerts its formative influence on the individual’s psyche.” <d-footnote>Fromm, "Method and Function," in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 148. A variation on this thesis can be found in a set of Fromm's lecture notes from 1931: "Childhood experiences are the medium through which society shapes the individual!" (Erich Fromm Papers b. 18 f. 1 / r. 17; "Psychologie und Soziologie," p. 8). (German original: "Kindheitserlebnisse sind Medium, durch das die Gesellschaft den Einzelnen formt!") The extent of the family's importance for the socialization and psychological development of individuals was at times a matter of contention between Fromm and the others at the IfS (namely Adorno), and obviously continues to be an important theoretical problem to this day. The focus on the family as an agent of socialization in the works published in the ZfS is only one side of the story with Fromm; his articles on criminology published outside the ZfS testify to his knowledge that the State was another important agent of socialization and hegemony. If Fromm did not spend much time talking about education in his writings from this period, it is probably because his acquaintance Siegfried Bernfeld was already working on a psychoanalytic Marxist account of education in works such as *Sisyphos oder die Grenzen der Erziehung* (1928, first edition 1925). See Gallistl, "Erich Fromm's Early Work on Criminal Justice," *Fromm Forum (English Edition)* 24 (2020), 80-100, for an overview of Fromm's criminological writings.</d-footnote> The family crucially mediates the production of individuals and therefore also the reproduction of the entirety of society. At every level of mediation, however, the ‘transmission’ (another way of translating <em>Vermittlung</em>) of contents and forms (socially functional traits) can break down: between society and family; between family and individual; and finally within the individual between conflicting psychic tendencies (or ‘agencies,’ ‘<em>Instanzen</em>,’ etc.). These sorts of breakdowns partially account for the difference between cases of ‘unhealthy’ individual mental pathology and the (air-quotes) normal “quasi-neurotic behavior of the masses,” which Fromm describes as “an appropriate reaction to current and real, though harmful and unsuitable, living conditions.”<d-footnote>Fromm, "Politics and Psychoanalysis" (1929) in Bronner and Kellner, *Critical Theory and Society: A Reader* (Routledge, 1989), 218; cf. Fromm, *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 145. At this point in time Fromm had, at least publicly, a sort of 'nominalist' concept of mental health according to which successful adaptation to social reality is the mark of mental health and failure to adapt the mark of pathology. He only developed a comprehensive account of his critical theory of mental health beginning in the 1940s.</d-footnote> Fromm further dealt with the family in his contribution to <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em>. He argued that the family is the first place where individuals are made to submit to irrational authority and acclimated to authoritarian interpersonal and social structures. Authority in the family prefigures the impositional character of society, the appearance of the social in class society as a factical, quasi-natural force external to the individual.<d-footnote>Fromm, "Studies on Authority and Family: Sociopsychological Aspects," *Fromm Forum (English Edition)* 24 (2020), 15. It is at this point that I must voice another disagreement with De Maria's critique of Fromm. De Maria has attempted to disassociate Fromm's analysis of authority from Horkheimer's account of reification and the 'anthropology of the bourgeois era' ("Fromm and Horkheimer," 51 et passim). However, he fails to acknowledge the methodological difference between the ontogenetic analysis of the psychology of authority carried out by Fromm and Horkheimer's historico-philosophical analysis of authority and reification in capitalist society. From a psychoanalytic perspective, the ontogenesis of the authority relation in the infantile situation cannot be meaningfully understood on the basis of reification, but neither can reification be understood on the basis of the infantile situation alone from the perspective of a critical theory of society.</d-footnote> The introjection of familial—paradigmatically fatherly—authority takes the form of the superego, but the traits of the superego are then projected onto social authority figures.<d-footnote>Fromm, "Sociopsychological Aspects," loc. cit. Compare with W.F.Haug's concept of the "Über-Uns" in *Elemente einer Theorie des Ideologischen* (Argument-Verlag, 1993), 61.</d-footnote> This reciprocal process of introjection and projection means that the family and society are inseparably connected at the level of the structure of the unconscious (the superego). The analysis of the connection between family and society leads to a restatement of his earlier thesis on the family as the agency of society:</p> <blockquote> <p>”[Freud] overlooked, however, that apart from the individual differences that exist in each family, families primarily represent certain social meanings and the family’s most important social function lies in their transmission [<em>Vermittlung</em>, mediation], and not in terms of the transmission of opinions and points of view, but rather in the production of the socially desired psychic structure.”<d-footnote>Fromm, "Sociopsychological Aspects," 18.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Fromm’s distinction between the content (“opinions and points of view”) and form (“psychic structure”) of the mind is rather too strong; his analysis of authority shows that form and content cannot be so easily disentangled when dealing with the mind—on what side of this distinction does the superego lie? Nonetheless, Fromm is broadly correct in this critique of Freud, which concludes in the claim that “the father is for the child (in terms of time) the first to transmit social authority, however, (in terms of meaning) he does not model authority but rather imitates it.”<d-footnote>Fromm, op. cit., 19.</d-footnote></p> <p>The psychic traits and structures formed in the experience of childhood, above all else the superego, must be reinforced if they are to persist, however. Already in 1931 Fromm had described the way in which the social stratification of class society repeats the “infantile situation” and its authoritarian structure, thus reinforcing the introjection of social authority as superego.<d-footnote>Fromm, *The Dogma of Christ and Other Essays on Religion, Psychology, and Culture* (Routledge, 2004), 12. One can find in Fromm's early work brief sketches of a theory of revolution centered around a dialectic of the oppressed class's Anlehnung (attachment, dependence, 'anaclisis') and Auflehnung (revolt; Fromm's sense is something like 'violent detachment') towards the ruling class. In a revolution, the repressed infantile impulse towards Auflehnung is reactivated, reclaimed, and mastered by the oppressed as they transcend the infantile situation imposed by society.</d-footnote> Internal anxiety and guilt on the one hand and external force on the other are mutually dependent and reinforcing; the inculcation of the former in the family is both socially necessitated (as individual survival strategy) and functionally harnessed (as socialization from above) by the dominating social order which makes violence and exploitation its foundational principles. The idea of a ‘purely hegemonic’ society is just as incoherent as the idea of a ‘purely coercive’ one in part because the psychic traits which make hegemony socially possible are originally formed in reaction to both social and ‘private,’ familial coercion.</p> <p>Focusing solely on the ‘negative’ side of authority and the family would paint an inaccurate picture, however. Fromm draws heavily from Freud’s account of the ambivalence of the child’s relation to the father in his analysis of authority and claims that affection is central to authority: the child wishes to be loved by the father, loves the father, and identifies with him. The family is a central influence for how an individual experiences love. The importance of the family for the individual’s experience and conception of love (its association with authority, its limited character, etc.) should be uncontroversial, but this degree of importance is something socially determined; the experience of the family as a private ‘reserve’ is retroactively reinforced by the heartless and repressive social world of capitalism.<d-footnote>See the remarks on the family in Fromm, *Beyond Freud: From Individual to Social Psychology* (American Mental Health Foundation Books, 1992).</d-footnote> It is not simply the case that childhood family experiences determines ones psychic structure, rather one’s ‘future’ or ‘destiny’ in society also turns out to have ‘determined’ the nature of their childhood and family insofar as the family serves its function vis-a-vis the reproduction of class, a process to which we can add today the reproduction of gender and race.</p> <h3 id="dynamite">Dynamite</h3> <p>In this section I will review Fromm’s early formulations on the psychic factors which contribute to social change, revolution, and crisis. I want to contest in particular Rolf Wiggershaus’s judgment that Fromm’s early formulations about revolution remained at the level of “ungrounded dogmatic assertion.”<d-footnote>Rolf Wiggershaus, *The Frankfurt School: Its History, Theories, and Political Significance*. Tr. Michael Robertson (MIT Press, 1995), 120</d-footnote> I begin with what can be called the ‘positive’ side of Fromm’s work on social change—crisis as <em>breakthrough</em>—before engaging with the more ‘negative’ side—crisis as <em>breakdown</em>.</p> <p>Fromm made some brief but enlightening remarks on the nature of revolutionary collective action in relation to psychological explanation. In the lecture notes for his 1931 course on psychology and sociology, he noted that revolutions are inexplicable from the perspective of ‘rational’ egoistic-utilitarian interest, as “clearly there are millions of people who would rather go hungry for years than uphold this social order.”<d-footnote>Erich Fromm Papers b. 18 f. 1 / r. 17; "Psychologie und Soziologie,\" p. 8. German original: "offenbar gibt es Millionen von Menschen, die lieber jahrelang hungern als diese gesellschaftlichen Zustände [aufrechterhalten]." Horkheimer had already made some groping gestures towards this sort of realization in the reflections on revolution contained in *Dämmerung*, a book consisting of aphorisms and brief essays written between 1929 and 1931, e.g. "A Discussion About Revolution;" "Such Is The World;" etc. *Dämmerung* is translated in Horkheimer*, Dawn and Decline: Notes 1929-1931 and 1950-1969*, trans.. Michael Shaw (Seabury Press, 1978).</d-footnote> Revolutions fly in the face of economistic, bourgeois explanations of social action, which generally categorize them as irrational outbursts fueled by the foolishness of the masses and the lies of outside agitators. For Fromm, however, people are neither inherently egoistic nor altruistic. Rather, the degree of these sorts of attitudes is determined by dynamic adaptation to the environment and social situation. The revolutionary conjunction of sympathy of the oppressed for their fellow downtrodden and hatred of the oppressed for their dominators is only ever unleashed at a mass scale in certain situations; Fromm considered investigating the problem of exactly <em>which</em> situations are correlate with such psychic upheavals and <em>why</em> to be one of the major tasks of analytic social psychology.</p> <p>In two early texts, namely <em>The Dogma of Christ</em> and the lecture notes for his 1931 course on psychology and sociology, Fromm seems to suggest that hatred—the class hatred of the oppressed towards their oppressors—is the decisive revolutionary affect, claiming for example that “Psychoanalysis shows [...] that the desire for the ruin of the ruling class can indeed be stronger than the desire for a decent life and security!”<d-footnote>Erich Fromm Papers b. 18 f. 1 / r. 17; "Psychologie und Soziologie," p. 8. German original: "Psychoanalyse zeigt, [...] dass sogar der Wunsch nach Sturz der herrschenden Klasse stärker sein kann als der Wunsch nach gutem Leben und Sicherheit!" A few years later in a text titled "Zur psychologischen Struktur der Autorität" Fromm turned his attention to the displacement of "Hass und Aggression" towards authority figures onto socially acceptable targets (Erich Fromm Papers b. 7 f. 6 / r. 9 "Zur psychologischen Struktur..." 7-8). It is notable that these two texts which bring up hatred in relation to the psychological foundations of revolution were written before the Nazi seizure of power, and that the topic all but disappears as time goes on. When he later returned to the "revolutionary character" in his 1963 treatment of the subject, he followed the individual-characterological indications of the 1930s in taking independence, love, critical thinking, etc. to be the most significant traits (Fromm, *The Dogma of Christ*, 128f).</d-footnote> While this positive evaluation of hatred can be seen as a necessary corrective to the rosy conceptions of social change found in the revisionist and reformist Marxists of the time, I find that it goes too far. It is my opinion that “the desire for a decent life” is typically a more important motivating factor for revolutionary change than hatred. Moreover, the two factors are not mutually exclusive but would probably be mutually reinforcing in a truly revolutionary situation where, to paraphrase Lenin, the ruling classes are <em>unable</em> to continue ruling and living in the established way and betterment of living conditions therefore necessitates their overthrow.</p> <p>Fromm also analyzed the ways in which psychic factors contribute to social dysfunction. As has been established, Fromm and the Frankfurt School did not consider functionalism to be a fundamental feature of society, but rather the result of variously adaptative, cooperative, coercive, and manipulative forms of human interaction. The upshot of this is that the functionalization of human drives can break down, and “libidinal energies” can, as Fromm puts it, “cease to be ‘cement,’ and turn into ‘dynamite.’ ”<d-footnote>Fromm, "Method and Function," in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 161.</d-footnote> This can happen in a basically ‘revolutionary’ way (see above), or it can happen because the established ‘canalizations’ of human drives “lag” behind the tendential development of society, the necessities of social reproduction, the plans of the ruling class, or some other socially determining factor.<d-footnote>See 157 in op. cit.</d-footnote> The tendency towards lag is stronger than that towards progress in Fromm’s estimation. This is because the psychic character of mature individuals is relatively fixed, and progressive changes in the socially hegemonic forms of canalizing human drives have to fight against this powerful force of psychic inertia acting in favor of the established order.<d-footnote>See also Horkheimer's invocation of "cultural lag" in Horkheimer, "Authority and the Family,".</d-footnote></p> <p>Between revolutionary progress and inertial archaism, there is one significant ‘ambivalent’ or ‘intermediate’ phenomenon to consider: rebellion. Fromm first drew a distinction between rebellion and revolution early in the 1930s.<d-footnote>This distinction was a crucial theme for the IfS in the mid 1930s to early 1940s. It informed their work on antisemitism in general as well as *Einzelstudien* such as Horkheimer's essay "Egoism and Freedom Movements" (1936, translated in *Between Philosophy and Social Science*) and Adorno's study of Wagner, which was written in the 1930s but not published until the 1950s.</d-footnote> As noted above, he acknowledged the role of hatred and aggression in the psychic constitution of revolutions early on, but he increasingly paid attention to what could be called the ‘non-aggressive’ aspects of revolution in order to distinguish it from mere rebellion. According to Fromm, rebellion is psychologically distinguished from revolution principally by its attitude towards authority:</p> <blockquote> <p>We would suggest that this process of defiant revolt [<em>Auflehnung</em>] against heretofore existing authority accompanied by the perpetuation of the authority-structure be called ‘rebellion.’ Fundamentally distinct from this is the destruction of the authoritarian attitude in which the authority-structure itself is destroyed and psychological independence takes the place of psychological dependence. In distinction to ‘rebellion,’ we would designate this process as ‘revolution’ in the psychological sense.<d-footnote>Erich Fromm Papers b. 7 f. 6 / r. 9; "Zur psychologischen Struktur der Autorität," 25-6; cf. Fromm " Sociopsychological Aspects," 54. German original: Wir würden vorschlagen, diesen Vorgang der trotzigen Auflehnung gegen bisherige Autorität bei Beibehaltung der Autoritätsstruktur Rebellion zu nennen. Grundsätzlich davon unterschieden ist die Zerstörung der Autoritätseinstellung, wenn die Autoritätsstruktur selbst zerstört wird und anstelle der psychischen Abhängigkeit psychische Selbständigkeit tritt. Zum Unterschied von der Rebellion würden wir diesen Vorgang als Revolution im psychologischen Sinn bezeichnen.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Fromm further stipulates that a psychological “revolution” at the level of society as a whole can only come about as the practice of a class which has overcome its oppression, achieved control over the social process, and instituted a rationally planned social order.<d-footnote>Ibid. Fromm was, of course, referring to the proletariat. This plan-based 'control' also provisionally extends to nature, potentially even including a fundamental change in attitude towards the "relative helplessness of human beings in the face of their biologically conditioned fate" and the "old Buddhist trio: aging-sickness-death" ("Zur psychologischen Struktur..." 27). The idea is sometimes expressed by Fromm with the word *Beherrschung* (domination, mastery), while in other instances he uses the less aggressive word *Bewältigung* (coping, management). The latter is more in the spirit of the project of Fromm and the Frankfurt School as a whole.</d-footnote>Rebellion, on the other hand, can be summarized as a change in object without a change in the way of relating to objects; the rebel’s defiance towards authority is itself authoritarian. In society, rebellion takes on the appearance of revolution but enacts reaction. The phenomenon of psychological rebelliousness can be considered both a symptom and exacerbating cause of general social (-psychological) crisis, as seen in both the era of the Protestant Reformation and bourgeois revolutions and the then-contemporary era of fascism.</p> <p>Thus, Fromm’s work counsels us to always keep the ambivalent potential of crisis in mind. Beyond the dichotomy of love and hate, the specific articulation of hatred—as class hatred, xenophobia, or something else—is one of the most important psychic factors in determining the direction of a social upheaval.</p> <h2 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks</h2> <p>What I most hope is that my reconstruction of Fromm’s contributions to Critical Theory helps to substantiate early Critical Theory as an admittedly incomplete but nonetheless systematic and thorough social theory. This is part of the broader project of the Critical Theory Working Group to recover the full extent of Critical Theory from the distorted reception which has prevailed for the last several decades. I also hope that this reconstruction has illustrated some considerable similarities between early Critical Theory and other critical forms of Marxism, such as those of Gramsci, Althusser, and Deleuze and Guattari, all of whom were important reference points for this essay.</p> <p>I have not been able to capture every dimension of Fromm’s work in this essay. Insofar as I have confronted the problem of the relation of society and nature in his thought during the writing of this essay, I have placed the accent on society and de-emphasized his avowed conception of psychoanalysis as a ‘natural science.’ My intent in doing so was to show that the real content of his work militates against such an understanding of psychoanalysis in particular and the social and human sciences in general.</p> <p>One consideration I was not able to incorporate into the main body of the essay is that of the need for historical reflexivity in Critical Theory. Fromm’s work contributed to the Frankfurt School’s reflexivity—i.e., its account of its own possibility and actuality—through his analysis of socio-psychological crisis and his theory of matricentricity. The former is simple enough: a group of intellectuals from bourgeois backgrounds joining together to criticize bourgeois society in the name of socialism presupposes some problem in the reproduction of the bourgeoisie at the individual level. Conversely, Fromm claimed that “the psychic basis of the Marxist social programme was predominantly the matricentric complex,” and that Marxism was the “rational, scientific expression if ideas that could only be expressed in fantasy under earlier economic conditions: Mother Earth gives all her children what they need, without regard for merits.”<d-footnote>Fromm, "The Theory of Mother Right and its Relevance for Social Psychology," (1934) in *The Crisis of Psychoanalysis*, 134.</d-footnote> In other words, Marxism (or Critical Theory) represented the conscious elaboration of the repressed utopian impulse that under the oppressive conditions of class society could previously only be expressed in unconscious fantasy or its artistic sublimation (as well as occasionally in interpersonal love). Fromm’s use of the Bachofenian theory of matriarchy and matricentricity to ground this utopian impulse is emblematic of the characteristic mixture of classical German philosophies such as idealism and romanticism with Marxist materialism that the Frankfurt School developed.</p> <p>It is worth briefly reflecting on some limitations of Fromm’s early work; there are three that main ones I would like to mention. As discussed above, Fromm had an ambivalent stance towards Freud’s metapsychology of drives. This led to a lack of clarity and precision when he turned to analyzing the most fundamental elements of the psyche, as he only began to develop an alternative metapsychology based in object relations at the very end of his time as a member of the IfS. The theory outlined in the 1937 essay would itself be revised again by the time Fromm published <em>Escape from Freedom</em> in 1941. <em>Escape</em> ended up being the text that properly initiated his mature theory, which was decisively influenced by Harry Stack Sullivan’s ideas and the renewed appreciation for religion that Fromm developed in the US.</p> <p>Fromm’s lack of direct attention to issues of gender and race/ethnicity is also disappointing, although unexceptional within the context of the IfS in the 1930s. His approach to gender was conditioned by his reception of Bachofen throughout his entire career. While this immunized him to certain misogynistic strands of thought often found in early psychoanalysis and German intellectual culture more broadly, it was in influence which was not entirely productive of analysis of contemporary relations of gender and sexuality.<d-footnote>I do not mean to say that Fromm never said anything worthwhile about gender. One of his most interesting early essays, "Die männliche Schöpfung," is an adventurous psychoanalytic feminist analysis of the Book of Genesis and the Babylonian Enuma Elish which uses the ideas of Bachofen (and Groddeck, probably by way of his then-paramour Karen Horney) to critique these texts as patriarchal fantasies motivated by womb envy. He even goes so far as to designate the patriarchal fantasy of man being capable of both siring (*Zeugen*) and birthing (*Gebären*) as "das Urbild alles idealistischen, sich über die natürlichen Bedingungen und Gegebenheiten hinwegsetzenden Denkens," implicitly positing an inseparable link between materialism and feminism thereby (E-GA XI-206).</d-footnote> Moreover, Fromm took over the paternalistic homophobia of early psychoanalysis that judged queer people as having failed to fully mature into genital heterosexuality.<d-footnote>I refer to the remarks on homosexuality in Fromm, *The Art of Loving* (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1956). Fromm also more tentatively connected homosexuality with sado-masochism and authoritarianism in his essay for the volume *Studien über Autorität und Familie* (Dietrich zu Klampen Verlag, 1963); see Institut für Sozialforschung, *Studien*, 125f.</d-footnote> Race appears as an even greater blindspot for Fromm than gender. Even after moving to the United States, he never really addressed the mechanics, history, and psychic impact of racialization in his analytic social psychology. He also largely neglected to analyze a form of prejudice which undoubtedly hit closer to home, namely anti-semitism.<d-footnote>However, Roger Frie has recently published a book that compellingly argues for the impact of the Third Reich and the Holocaust on Fromm's life and thought; see Frie, *Edge of Apocalypse: Erich Fromm, Fascism, and the Holocaust* (Oxford University Press, 2024).</d-footnote> In accordance with the theoretical position of the IfS at the time, his early social-psychological analyses of fascism and nazism focus more on the family, the dynamics of authority, and the class structure of Germany than anti-semitism and racism.</p> <p>The third weakness is the complete absence of a theory of groups or group dynamics. This absence is, like the previous limitation, common to the Frankfurt School in general; exceptions are found in Horkheimer’s abortive theory of rackets, related strands of thought from the period of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, and Benjamin’s analysis of ‘the crowd.’ Fromm’s analysis of the family—and this also goes for Horkheimer and Adorno’s work on the topic—generally does not lend any autonomy to family as a group-formation. What is present in the family is mainly society and the individual. Again, Fromm’s hesitance to simply accept Freud’s theories was a double-edged sword, as the focus on the influence of social factors in the development of authority and the superego in the family tended to eclipse the important group dynamics which Freud had discovered in his almost a-social theory of the oedipus complex and “family romance.”</p> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>The <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> is cited as (ZfS [volume in roman numerals], [page number]).
