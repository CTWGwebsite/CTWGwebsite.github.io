While the core argument and structure remain faithful to the original presentation, this written adaptation includes the following changes: extensive citations of key claims, footnotes providing additional context and clarification, and a refinement of theoretical points to ensure stronger fidelity to Hessen’s original work. I hope you find in this blog post both a reconstruction of why Hessen’s intervention was so electrifying to science historiography and an appreciation of his enduring significance as a theoretical bridge connecting diverse strands of Marxist historical analysis.</p> <h2 id="hessen-reconstruction">Hessen Reconstruction</h2> <p>What is the relationship of science and technology to human history, and how have Marxists conceptualized this problematic within historical materialism? The work of Boris Hessen represents one of the most sophisticated attempts to apply a materialist analysis to the history of science—specifically, how the economic needs of early capitalism influenced what we now think of as modern science and the Scientific Revolution. In this blog, I explore how Hessen pursues his analysis in his seminal essay “The Social and Economic Roots of Newton’s <em>Principia</em>” (henceforth referred to as “Newton’s Roots”).<d-footnote>I draw greatly from Gideon Freudenthal and Peter McLaughlin’s fantastic reconstructive preface in Freudenthal and McLaughlin, “Classical Marxist Historiography of Science: The Hessen–Grossmann Thesis,” in *The Social and Economic Roots of the Scientific Revolution*, ed. Gideon Freudenthal and Peter McLaughlin, Boston Studies in the Philosophy and History of Science 278 (Dordrecht: Springer, 2009).</d-footnote></p> <p>While Hessen did not develop the first Marxist analysis of science,<d-footnote>Notably: Engels' detailed study on the development of rifles, Christopher Caudwell's coverage of the crisis of physics in the 20th century, and J.B.S. Haldane's unwitting revitalization of Julius Schaxel's "dialectical biology" all marked important contributions to the analysis of these areas, among others.</d-footnote> Hessen’s approach was one of the first truly systematic attempts.<d-footnote>For those interested in further reading, see Helena Sheehan, *Marxism and the Philosophy of Science: A Critical History* (London: Verso, 2018\) and John Bellamy Foster, *The Return of Nature: Socialism and Ecology* (New York: Monthly Review Press, 2020). Both Sheehan and Foster offer good overviews and genealogies of Marxist science historiography, though are somewhat limited in their treatments of critical theory, labeled "Western Marxism.” Furthermore, "heterodox" Soviet Marxist thinkers like Lev Vygotsky and Evald Ilyenkov are not handled with the same level of sensitivity and care as figures such as Hessen.</d-footnote> Moreover, his work helps us see past the often oversimplified division between “Western Marxism” and Soviet thought, revealing a productive tension in international Marxism through attempts to apply historical materialism in understanding science, technology, and nature under capitalist society.</p> <p>In the same vein, Henryk Grossman makes the connection between science and capitalist society explicit in his work with the Institute of Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung, or IfS)—several of Grossmann’s articles were published in the IfS’s journal <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> (ZfS). Grossmann was in fact one of the first defenders of Hessen’s work against critics such as George. N. Clark, Richard S. Westfall, etc. as these critics fundamentally misunderstood Hessen’s theses, and, by extension, Grossmann’s own formulation of the relation between science and capitalist society. While both reached similar conclusions independently, and Grossmann’s work is introduced at points, I focus on Hessen’s formulation here.</p> <p>To do justice to Hessen’s analysis of Newton, it is important to apply Hessen’s own considerations toward Newton to himself. What was the context of this intervention? What were the social and economic roots of this text? And what can this context reveal about the text? To answer these questions, I first provide a brief biography of Hessen up to his Newton text. I then examine the core arguments of the Hessen-Grossmann thesis, before finally exploring what Hessen’s materialist approach to science historiography might mean for both theory and practice today.</p> <h3 id="a-brief-biography-of-boris-hessen">A Brief Biography of Boris Hessen</h3> <p>Boris Hessen was born in 1893 to a middle-class Jewish family in Elisavetgrad (now in Ukraine), then part of the Russian Empire. His intellectual journey began early; we have evidence of his involvement in local Marxist movements during his gymnasium years, showing how science (here, seen equally as education) and politics were never separate for Hessen. Between 1913 and 1914, Hessen and his gymnasium friend Igor Tamm (who would later win the Nobel Prize in Physics) studied physics and natural science at the University of Edinburgh. There, Hessen worked under Edmund T. Whittaker, a mathematician and physicist specializing in astronomy and numerical methods. It is from his teacher that Hessen inherited an interest in the history of physics. Whittaker was known in academia equally as a scientist and as a historian of science. While studying under Whittaker, Hessen cultivated his sense that scientific and historical analysis must be integrated. This would become a neat historical motif as later Marxist scientists, such as Richard Lewontin, also match this historical pattern.<d-footnote>In a similar vein, Richard Lewontin *critically* inherited his research problematic and approach from Theodosius Dobzhansky, his advisor. To quote Lewontin, “My own problematic is the problematic of my professor. I recognize that everything I do in science I get in one way or another from the [research] program he initiated.” This, most likely, did not just include guiding scientific research questions, but a sense of social service as well as social critique. See David Depew, “Richard Lewontin and Theodosius Dobzhansky: Genetics, Race, and the Anxiety of Influence,” *Biological Theory* 19, no. 3 (September 2024): 151–67, https://doi.org/10.1007/s13752-023-00452-2.</d-footnote></p> <p>Returning to Russia in 1914, Hessen continued his studies in physics, mathematics, and statistics at St. Petersburg University. Then came the Russian Revolution and Civil War—a period that transformed both Russia and Hessen himself. He enlisted in the Red Army, joined the Communist Party in 1919, and served on the Revolutionary Military Council from 1919 to 1921. After the civil war, Hessen worked at the Party School while continuing his physics studies at various institutions, eventually graduating from the Institute of Red Professors in Moscow in 1928.</p> <p>Hessen’s dual position as both a physicist and a party intellectual placed him at the intersection of science and politics during a period of intense ideological battle in Soviet academia. This intersection became increasingly dangerous for Hessen. He faced severe accusations of being a “Machist” (a follower of Ernst Mach’s positivist philosophy) and a “right deviationist”—both potentially being connected to his Menshevik past.<d-footnote>The veracity of the accusations against Hessen remains a theme in secondary literature. For further reading, see Gerardo Lenna and Giulia Rispoli, “Boris Hessen at the Crossroads of Science and Ideology. From International Circulation to the Soviet Context,” *Societate Si Politica* XIII, no. 1 (2019): 37–63.</d-footnote> In particular, Einstein’s theory of relativity and quantum mechanics came under attack throughout the late 1920s by Communist Party philosophers in the USSR, who denounced such theory as “bourgeois science” contaminated by capitalist values. Hessen found himself in a snare: he was a Marxist who wanted to defend relativity and quantum mechanics as true advances in physics in a hostile social environment, and a physicist who was simultaneously committed to socialist construction.</p> <p>Hessen presented “The Social and Economic Roots of Newton’s <em>Principia</em>” in 1931 at the Second International Congress of the History of Science in London as a member of the Soviet delegation led by Nikolai Bukharin. Hessen’s report is often considered a landmark in the historiography of science, with eminent figures such as J.D. Bernal and J.G. Crowther supporting Hessen. At the same time, however, Hessen’s sympathizers were outnumbered by detractors such as G.N. Clark, A.R. Hall, and R.S. Westfall, who made it their mission to critique Hessen’s work.</p> <p>The importance of Hessen’s report still reverberates in the fields of STS (science and technology studies) and the history of science, where Hessen is taken to be an exemplar of an <em>externalist</em> account of science history.<d-footnote>In brief, “internalism” was the dominant historiographical program in the history of science during the early 20th century. The program saw science as being done by intellectuals propelled in finding solutions to problems, emphasizing science as a body of ideas disconnected from its larger context. For an excellent discussion on Hessen’s reception in science historiography and the larger methodological disputes of “internalist” and “externalist” recounting, see Gerardo Lenna, “The International and Interdisciplinary Circulation of Boris Hessen’s Theses, ” in *Boris Hessen’s Manuscripts and Documents on the History of Physics: A Historical Materialist Textbook*, ed. Pietro Daniel Omodeo and Sean Winkler (Verum Factum, 2022), 75–130, https://iris.unive.it/handle/10278/5024380. Lenna suggests that these debates emerged in reaction to what Hessen represented\!</d-footnote> Fast forwarding to contemporary times, the British historian Patricia Fara’s 2021 biography of Newton, for example, cites Hessen approvingly as someone who broke a taboo on reevaluating key scientific figures.<d-footnote>Patricia Fara, *Life After Gravity: Isaac Newton’s London Career* (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2021), 218–222.</d-footnote> Fara’s judgment is representative of reception to Hessen’s report outside of the Soviet Union as an <em>event</em>.<d-footnote>Fara, *Life After Gravity*, 218–222; cf. Freudenthal and McLaughlin, “Marxist Historiography of Science,” 26–34.</d-footnote></p> <p>For Marxist science scholars, Hessen’s text has another valence. Loren Graham and others, for example, understood this text as a lobbying tactic by Hessen: party philosophers would not challenge the validity of Newton’s theories, and showing that these theories were motivated by bourgeois concerns, in Hessen’s eyes, would show that scientific ‘accuracy’ could exist whatever the motivations were for undertaking it.<d-footnote>Loren R. Graham, “The Socio-Political Roots of Boris Hessen: Soviet Marxism and the History of Science,” *Social Studies of Science* 15, no. 4 (1985): 705–22, https://doi.org/10.1177/030631285015004005.</d-footnote> However, there is little evidence that his paper had any effect in the internal Soviet philosophical battles over Einstein’s work.</p> <p>Hessen returned to the USSR after setting the discipline of science history ablaze in the first world with his Newton presentation. Between 1934 and 1936, while continuing his scientific and history of science work, Hessen secured his last position as deputy director of the Physics Institute in Moscow. This position did not do him any favors. At this point, with the paranoia of ‘anti-Soviet’ conspiracy at fever pitch and his reputation still suspect, this new position of influence only reinforced the intensity of his potential dubiety. Like many “dissident” Soviet thinkers and philosophers, he fell victim to the Stalinist purges.</p> <h3 id="the-hessen-grossmann-thesis-applied-to-newton">The Hessen-Grossmann Thesis Applied to Newton</h3> <p>Hessen’s analysis of Newton in “Newton’s Roots” represents a broader framework that scholars gloss as the Hessen-Grossman thesis. This thesis—its description as such suggesting an intimate connection with Grossman’s work—offers a materialist framework for understanding techno-scientific development through three interconnected claims:</p> <p>First, technology opens up horizons for science. Scientific inquiry does not emerge in a vacuum, but is enabled by existing technological practices.</p> <p>Second, technology simultaneously acts as a constraint/limit on science. Scientists can only conceptualize and investigate phenomena that <em>materially</em> manifest in existing technological practices.</p> <p>Third, the interaction between science and technology in society generates a <em>world-picture</em> (Grossman) or <em>image of nature</em> (Hessen)—essentially, the dominant ideology or conception of nature in a given historical period.</p> <p>Hessen’s analysis of Newton elaborates how the Hessen-Grossmann thesis explains techno-scientific development. For claims 1 and 2, Hessen argues that like any other form of labor, scientific labor is socially determined at its core. In turn, one of the key aspects of this social determination is the existence of particular, concrete <em>technologies</em> prior to the scientific process, technologies that Hessen argued <em>expressed</em> existing material practices—that is, the forces and relations of production. Scientists study these technologies to produce theories, models, and concepts. Conversely, science itself supplies new technological possibilities or means, creating what might be called a virtuous cycle of development.</p> <p>In Newton’s case, Hessen demonstrates how scientific labor is socially determined by showcasing how the practical mechanics of early capitalism furnished the content for Newton’s theories. Consider his examples from the text. Maritime trade created demand for better ships and navigation, pushing forward developments in fluid dynamics and astronomy. Military needs drove innovations in ballistics and fortification design. Industrial challenges in mining and warfare required mechanical solutions spanning from basic machinery to advanced materials research. Hessen argues that all these practical concerns—excluding mining and metallurgy, which he classifies as chemistry problems—afforded, if not motivated or necessitated, the emergence of theoretical mechanics as a new science that could synthesize these diverse practical applications. In short, the <em>means</em> of production (tools, machines, etc.) supply and bound scientific labor’s developmental trajectory.</p> <p>Crucially, Hessen connects these technological needs to the rising bourgeois class:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Step by step, science flourished along with the bourgeoisie. In order to develop its industry, the bourgeoisie required a science that would investigate the properties of material bodies and the manifestations of the forces of nature. Hitherto science had been the humble servant of the church and had not been allowed to go beyond the limits set by the church. The bourgeoisie had need of science, and science rebelled against the church together with the bourgeoisie […]” <d-footnote>Boris Hessen. “The Social and Economic Roots of Newton’s Principia,” in *The Social and Economic Roots of the Scientific Revolution*, (Dordrecht: Springer, 2009), 56\.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>“Similarly, the division of labor within the various branches of industry was first put into practice in the army. This, in condensed form, is the entire history of the bourgeois system […]” <d-footnote>Hessen, “Newton’s Roots,” 49\.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Just as revealing as what Newton addressed is what he failed to address. Hessen points out that Newtonian natural philosophy omitted problems in thermodynamics and electrodynamics, fields that would later be crucial to understanding the conservation of energy implied in Newton’s own theory. Such an omission can be explained: the invention of the steam engine, understood by Hessen as embodied material practice, had not yet occurred! The ‘material conditions’ for theorizing such sciences simply did not exist in Newton’s time. As Hessen explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>“It was not the development of the motor and the invention of the steam engine that created the industrial revolution of the 18th century, but on the contrary the steam engine gained such enormous importance precisely because the division of labour that was emerging in manufacture and its increasing productivity made the invention of a machine-driven tool both possible and necessary, and the steam engine, which had been born in the mining industry, found a field awaiting its application as a motive power.”<d-footnote>Hessen, “Newton’s Roots,” 78\.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>One note here. According to Hessen, there was a further development in the social world between Newton’s time and the development of thermodynamics—that being <em>economics</em>—in the transition from <em>merchant</em> capital to <em>industrial</em> or <em>manufacturing</em> capital. These social developments posed new technical issues, which in turn generated new scientific problems.</p> <p>Following Hessen, we see a pattern here. What makes the Hessen-Grossmann framework so powerful is its historical specificity. Technology becomes an ‘enabling constraint’ for science: such a constraint simultaneously makes specific scientific inquiries possible, while limiting others, but <em>only</em> during specific historical periods tied to particular social formations. The concept enabling constraints epitomizes claims 1 and 2 of the Hessen-Grossmann thesis. We can understand the mechanisms of these enabling constraints through the following process:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post31-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post31-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post31-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post31.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>First, economic forces specify social and practical needs.<br/> Second, technological means realize these economically specified needs.<br/> Third, science examines existing technology and conceptualizes it.<br/> Finally, science changes the structure of technological realization, which in turn alters the economic specification of needs.</p> <p>This creates a dialectical relationship that Freudenthal and McLaughlin aptly describe:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The need or desire to expand commerce, ascertained by Hessen, is not of itself a need to improve shipping… The decision to improve shipping for the purpose of expanding commerce […] presupposes the consideration of possible concrete projects characterized by the means for their realization.” <d-footnote>Freudenthal and McLaughlin, *“*Marxist Historiography of Science,” 6\.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, economic needs do not automatically translate into technological problems—any such translation itself requires existing scientific and technological practices. As Merton notes, “[e]conomic and military needs may be satisfied by other than technologic means. But given the routine of fulfilling these wants by technologic invention […] it may be said that, in a limited sense, necessity is the (foster) mother of invention.”<d-footnote>Robert Merton, *Science, Technology, and Society in Seventeenth-Century England* (Osiris, 1938), 2nd ed. 158 quoted in Freudenthal and McLaughlin, “Marxist Historiography of Science,” 6\.</d-footnote> Hessen and Grossmann are interested in the enacted abstractions happening behind people’s backs; what explains the peculiar social patterns of modern science’s actions and explanations based on a particular social order. The social mechanism behind mechanical thought (the mechanism behind the mechanism). This phenomenon can go by many names: mechanical thought, instrumental reason, or a reductive form of explanation, and it is what distinguishes modern scientific practice from what came previously.<d-footnote>Here I use *enaction* in a technical sense following the enactive approach in embodied cognition. The fundamental tenet of this school of thought is that life and mind are deeply intertwined. The organism, as an agent, has an intrinsic normativity to precariously maintain itself and distinguish itself from its environment. This normativity becomes the seed of the organism's adaptive sense-making (enaction). The interpenetration of mind, organism, and environment is where cognition lies. Meaning is not found, but brought forth by many of the organism's autonomous dimensions. For us human beings, these would be our organic, sensorimotor, intersubjective, and linguistic dimensions, among others. Following this approach, abstractions have to be understood developmentally (ontogenetically, phylogenetically, and socially) and situationally (culturally, ecologically, etc.) in order to understand how they 'decouple' (become autonomous) from their original context.</d-footnote></p> <p>One should caution against a potentially vulgar interpretation of the thesis, wherein the purpose of scientific inquiry <em>in general</em> is facilitating economic development by improving technology. The claim, instead, isn’t about this “mechanism” (economic need -&gt; tech -&gt; science), but rather on the <em>conceptualization</em> of how such a social mechanism became a dominant strategy and tactic in the production and reproduction of modern social life.</p> <p>For both Hessen and Grossmann, the dominance of scientific inquiry as a social mechanism stems from a real separation between conception and execution, which was underway as a historical process via the introduction of machinery and mechanization across various sectors and industries. A reductionist strategy of abstraction, a “world-picture” or ideology, <em>instrumentalizes</em> two poles of commodity-producing labor/labor-power—the qualitative (skills and judgments) and the quantitative (the precise rules and protocols)—such that people are indeed <em>reduced</em> to being cogs in a machine via strict quantitative parameters. In turn, these very parameters incentivize these human cogs being replaced by actual machines due to the unique nature of social domination under capitalism: value enacted by the market. Mechanical labor homogenizes labor to be equal qualitatively and only differ quantitatively, and this difference is prescribed with measurement. In other words, labor becomes modulated as a social mechanism; the potential autonomy of labor is reduced to being a signal-to-noise ratio in the valorization of capital.</p> <p>However, the content of science isn’t just bound by the socioeconomic and technological conditions on their own. Another factor in scientific concept-formation and practice is the ideological horizon determined by the various historical moments in class warfare. Hessen is particularly illustrative here, distinguishing between Newton and Descartes’ mechanical worldviews and showing that these differences arose from their ideological struggles and commitments. Thus, to properly reconstruct Newtonian theory, one must place him as representative and nexus of many social forces, which reciprocally determine each other. Newton was a member and partisan of the ascending bourgeois class of the English revolutions, a protestant, and a contemporary and a friend of philosophers and scientists (Locke, Bentley, Leibniz, etc.). Yet, the revolutionary transformation of society involved many diverse people and class representatives from Thomas Hobbes to the Leveller Richard Overton who all affected the content of Newtonian natural philosophy and his metaphysical and theological beliefs. Newton’s interweaving of religious elements with the principle of mechanical causation (the intertwined ideal and material elements) wasn’t just a deficiency in his personal conception, but a trace of, or reflective of, ideological battles of the time. Indeed for Hessen, the dialectic between individuals and collectives is key in determining the <em>political form</em> in which the ideological content of science manifests. Newton as an individual scientist only makes sense in a broader socioeconomic context, yet Newtonian mechanics was a singular achievement in the history of science. This as our text repeatedly demonstrated is not because of a genius idea or individual, but a determinate social individual. Put simply, Newton was an articulator and articulation of a particular socioeconomic condition, 17th-century London.<d-footnote>This argument is given its full weight in Sean Winkler. “Individuals and Collectives in the Philosophy of Boris Hessen: An Introduction.” *Science in Context* 34, no. 1 (2021): 121–36. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0269889722000096.</d-footnote></p> <p>These various ‘political forms’ in which ideological content manifests can be seen concretely in Hessen’s comparison of Newton and Descartes. Like Newton, Descartes was a man of all seasons—an esteemed mathematician, philosopher, and humanist operating outside the university milieu still dominated by Aristotelian physics and Thomism. Alongside figures like Hobbes, Bacon, and Boyle, Descartes represented the ‘new science’ positioned against both scholastic dogma and Church authority.<d-footnote>Grossman demonstrates the enabling condition or the content-determination of the mechanistic Carestain method terrifically. The function of the mechanistic method can be summarized by three interrelated points. (i) reduce the socially necessary labor time needed to learn, teach, and comprehend knowledge “So that it could be taught in a very little time” (Descartes to Mersenne, Nov 20, 1629 quoted by Grossman); (ii) map the different sciences “according to definite classifications,” such that uptake of known facts can be accelerated countering the tendency of secrecy among artisans by simplifying “the road to truth;” (iii) subvert intellectual over-specialization and elitism by making the method *exoteric*, such that the peasants are equal to the philosophers, in Henryk Grossmann, “Descartes and the Social Origins of the Mechanistic Concept of the World,” in *The Social and Economic Roots of the Scientific Revolution*, ed. Gideon Freudenthal and Peter McLaughlin, Boston Studies in the Philosophy and History of Science 278 (Dordrecht: Springer, 2009), 165–168.</d-footnote> Newton and Descartes’ approaches to the mechanism-divinity problem differed significantly. Newton explicitly incorporated God into his mechanical system through arguments from design, treating motion as requiring external causation and introducing the Creator to provide matter with its initial impulse. Descartes, by contrast, treated the world as an isolated physical system where no external agent (God) could interfere with natural processes, explaining planetary motion through purely material forces without requiring divine intervention.</p> <p>These contrasting approaches illuminates what Hessen means when he treats ideology. For him, ideology is to be taken etymologically as a ‘science of ideas,’ which are always embedded in material practices constituting social reality. The different scientific positions Newton and Descartes adopted were refractions of the broader struggles between feudal and capitalist institutions. Newton’s theological compromises reflected the complex negotiations between diverse figures—from Hobbes to the Levellers—that shaped his intellectual milieu, while Descartes’ more consistent materialism refracted a different configuration of these same underlying social conflicts. Both individual commitment and collective historical forces combined to determine which ‘political form’ the ideological content of their science would take. Taken as a whole, the Hessen-Grossman thesis asserts that technology is the enabling constraint behind modern science, and that scientific and technological means generate a world-picture or image of nature, which, in the last analysis, is a product of class struggle.</p> <p>The final section of “Newton’s <em>Principia</em>” is unfortunately the weakest part of Hessen’s text. Hessen reverts to bourgeois reductionism in his discussion of the Luddites, and he fails to notice that his own analysis resonates with their own,<d-footnote>For an excellent reading on the Luddites, I recommend Gavin Mueller, *Breaking Things at Work: The Luddites Are Right About Why You Hate Your Job* (London: Verso, 2021).</d-footnote> instead holding reservations for their rhetoric. In spite of this stumbling block, however, I believe another dimension can be brought out in Hessen’s rhetoric. I read this final section as a jab towards Communist Party philosophers whom Hessen deems the wreckers of socialist construction. These philosophers are responsible for being the most advanced practitioners of science and the severest critics of this very enterprise; yet, these pressing demands remain unattended to, their custodians having vanished!<d-footnote>While admittedly this claim is a bit audacious and hard to validate given the limited information about Hessen's life, I think it is worth staking here. Hessen spent the majority of his life as a physics instructor focused on the methodology of the natural sciences—keenly interested in the unity of the natural sciences, its history, and the philosophy of science. He taught at various universities, as the biography section of this blog detailed, and was involved with the 'Circle of Physicists-Mathematicians-Materialists.' Indeed, one of his last projects was a planned 700-page textbook of translated sources and expositions on the history of physics. One of Hessen's contemporaries, the positivist Hans Reichenbach, claimed that for them the history of science was mere recreational activity. Hessen could not have disagreed more. From this broader view, I believe Hessen wanted to change the way education was done, for education was an inner moment of the social form of scientific labor—and to expand its variation so it could fit and realize socialist society, history had to be brought into methodology. He saw the party philosopher's disinterest in concrete history to be a disaster in the waiting.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2> <p>What is the relationship of science and technology to human history? As I have argued, I believe that the Hessen-Grossmann materialist framework for science historiography offers a sophisticated and historically localized answer to this question—one which merits serious reconsideration today. Though the consequences and implications of this framework are immense, I highlight a few promising threads.</p> <p><strong>There is no “neutral” technoscientific rationality.</strong> Science and technology emerged, persisted, and developed due to specific historical configurations—their current mystified appearance is a product of capitalist society. This has direct implications for revolutionary politics. “Appropriating the means of production” means more than simply taking over existing machinery. It requires transforming the social form of scientific and technical labor itself. The naive understanding that we can just seize capitalist machinery without addressing the class relations inherent in their design and deployment, espoused especially by ecomodernists, is misguided.</p> <p><strong>Given the “enabling constraint” thesis and the “ideology” thesis, any philosophical account of capitalist society must explain how material practices transition from one set of scientific and technological labor means to another.</strong> For a negative example, consider Moishe Postone’s analysis of capitalist temporality, which does not have such an account even though he scaffolds a potential one.<d-footnote>Moishe Postone, *Time, Labor, and Social Domination: A Reinterpretation of Marx’s Critical Theory* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 176–179. Indeed Postone, regrettably, does not see how Henryk Grossman’s account could enrich his social-form theory, where the “empirical” is not far behind the “real abstractions” of the commodity-form—it is a particular realization of it. He interprets Grossman as a slightly more sophisticated “reflection” theorist.</d-footnote> Just as with the concept of time and synchronicity, the shift from Newtonian to Einsteinian physics reflects not just abstract scientific progress but transformations in material technology and ideology. Newton’s physics corresponded to a centralized, universal clockwork maintaining uniform time, while Einstein’s emerged in what Matteo Pasquinelli, citing Peter Galison, calls “an electromechanical world” connected by new communication networks like the telephone.<d-footnote>Matteo Pasquinelli, *The Eye of the Master: A Social History of Artificial Intelligence* (Verso, 2024), 91. This material influence extends even to the conceptual level. Einstein's elevator thought experiment could only emerge in an era when mechanical vertical transport was a common urban experience in the 20th century, showing how 'enabling conditions' shape not just scientific instruments but the very metaphors through which scientists think.</d-footnote></p> <p><strong>The Hessen-Grossmann framework allows us to develop a singular yet internally diverse history of science</strong>—one that sees the history of science as a part of the material history of planet Earth or the earth system. The Haber-Bosch process exemplifies this approach: ammonia synthesis emerged from Germany’s dependence on Chilean caliche (nitrate) for both feeding populations through fertilizers and sustaining its military through explosives during WWI. When British naval blockades severed these supply chains, triggering the war’s first naval engagement off Chile’s Pacific coast, this dual dependency transformed from regular ‘economic’ trade into existential crisis or a real practical challenge. The scaling-up of Haber and Bosch’s laboratory process into industrial production crystallized how bourgeois science-industry integration serves the contradictory imperatives of social reproduction and destruction. This transformation reveals the barbarism inherent in capitalist scientific development. Chile’s control of nitrate deposits, seized through the War of the Pacific and organized under the Anglo-Chilean Nitrate &amp; Railway Company, created an extractive economy that devastated entire ecosystems. Today, Tocopilla Province bears witness to this violence: hundreds of abandoned mining towns and endless piles of overburden earth scarring the landscape. The Haber-Bosch “solution” merely shifted this ecological destruction from extraction to industrial synthesis, while nitrate’s dual use in fertilizers and explosives embodies the productive-destructive unity of capitalist technoscience.<d-footnote>Ed Conway *Material World: A Substantial Story of Our Past and Future* (Dublin: Penguin Random House, 2024), 163–173; María Soledad Ureta-Zañartu, “How Chemistry Shaped Societies: The Case of the Atacama Desert in Chile,” *ChemTexts* 9, no. 1 (December 9, 2022), https://doi.org/10.1007/s40828-022-00172-3.</d-footnote> Thus, to narrate a materialist history of science, one that is neither purely focused on the nature of “extraction” or “expropriation,” one must foreground the web of social relations (singular) as containing both moments latent in it.</p> <p>As indicated briefly in the introduction, these implications were not lost for science historians. Broadly speaking, Hessen’s reception followed several trajectories. European ‘socialist’ historians labeled him as a crude economic reductionist, while ironically adopting the “externalist” approach to science history he helped inaugurate. Positivists, Stalinists, and vulgar anti-Stalinists alike mischaracterized him as an “internalist,” claiming his 1931 presentation was an anomaly in his oeuvre, whereas his previous work mainly took itself to caring about science’s internal conceptual development. More recently, social constructivists in sociology of science have advanced what Steven Shapin famously articulated: “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.”<d-footnote>Steven Shapin, The Scientific Revolutions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2018), 1</d-footnote> The ‘it’ here refers to the concept of the Scientific Revolution itself, which Shapin treats as a historiographical construct rather than a discrete historical event, but this approach lacks the self-reflexivity to examine what the selection of historical case studies reveals about the historians and society themselves, especially in terms of concrete practice. This “cultural turn” in science history focuses on micro-histories and questions the alleged discontinuity between pre-modern and modern science. Some go as far as saying there is no such thing as modernity.</p> <p>As I hope my presentation made clear, I think that Hessen was neither an internalist nor an externalist. I follow others like Sean Winkler and Pietro Daniel Omodeo who also argue such, as both internalists and externalists share the conviction that the core of modern science was the advance of the physical-mathematical disciplines. For Hessen, this misses the real emergence of these disciplines in practical activity, where problems of knowledge are inseparable from problems of social order. Even for proponents of the cultural turn, Hessen remains a trailblazer with his ideology thesis. As Omodeo observes:</p> <blockquote> <p>“But, at a deeper level, the Scientific Revolution itself was the expression of an ideology, namely the Eurocentrism that it implicitly justified. Such ideology is not mere mystification — an intentional lie to be dispelled and corrected. Rather, it is a conception that constitutes political action. It reflects on society, justifying and redirecting it. Hence, the Scientific Revolution cannot be treated as a mere problem of historiography and epistemology to be revised and eventually substituted by a ‘correct’ narrative (or abandoned for no narrative at all) once a hypothetical agreement among the academic community of historians of science (perhaps ‘historians of knowledge’) has been reached. Rather, the Scientific Revolution should be understood as the cultural expression of specific relations of power and a specific historical arrangement of society at a global level. Its geo-historical coordinates correspond to European colonial expansion and the establishment of Europe-centered forms of global dominion. It is by no means accidental that the dawn of the Scientific Revolution coincided with the definitive end of European centrality in geo-politics and the establishment of a US-centric globalization.”<d-footnote>Pietro Daniel Omodeo, “Boris Hessen’s Philosophy of the Scientific Revolution,” in Omodeo and Winkler, *History of Physics*, 174.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Hessen’s enduring insight is that science, politics, and society cannot be delinked. Science was not a disinterested intellectual pursuit of the truth outside of worldly concerns, but one of corporeal organization and the co-evolution of the natural and social worlds. By investigating the <em>forms of life</em> that shape scientific practice, historiography transcends mere narrative to become <em>functional</em> in the metabolism between society and nature. For Hessen, socialist science must simultaneously keep pace with advanced capitalist science while being its harshest critic. It accomplishes this by refusing to separate scientific practice from scientific history. In the absence of such an integrated approach, the <em>realization</em> of an emancipated historical form of science cannot manifest, and the relationship of the content of science to its expressions (technology, research activity, education, etc.) will be mystified.</p> <p>Similar to what Marx wrote in the 1844 Manuscripts, “Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*, trans. Martin Milligan (Progress Publishers, 1959), 43</d-footnote> To quote Winkler, Hessen’s version of dialectical materialism “mediates socialist construction alongside both the relative limits of socioeconomic development and technological progress and the absolute limits of natural laws.”<d-footnote>Sean Winkler, “‘A Pantheon of Great Ideas’: Boris Hessen and the History &amp; Philosophy of Science,” in Omodeo and Winkler, *History of Physics*, 45–46.</d-footnote> For Hessen, science represents the unity of revolutionary theory and practice. To put it in a pithy phrase: we should not just “do science for the revolution” (or worse, substitute science in place of revolution), but also “make revolution for science”—recognizing that the next scientific revolution will necessarily be a <em>social</em> one.</p>]]></content><author><name>Anatarah Bin AlKaf</name></author><category term="Nature"/><category term="Science"/><category term="report"/><category term="write-up"/><category term="study"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Introduction to a Marxist Science Historiography]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reflections on the Right and its Violence, Part II</title><link href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ReactionPt2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reflections on the Right and its Violence, Part II"/><published>2025-11-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-11-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ReactionPt2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ReactionPt2/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post36-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post36-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post36-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post36.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> An ICE agent in Broadview, Illinois wears a skull mask, a garment associated with neo-nazi terrorism (September 6, 2025) </div> </div> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ReactionPt1/">Read Part I</a></p> <h2 id="v---translatio-imperii">V - Translatio Imperii</h2> <p>Do these people—the killers—matter? Do they hold positions of power? Are their acts historically impactful beyond the immediate carnage? Sociologically speaking, they do not seem to originate from the same source as military, special forces, border patrol, police, etc. This is a new development: The old kind of killers—the Klan and Black Legion, the ex-officers of the Freikorps and squadristi, Eastern European pogromists, or even the neo-fascist bombers of the Italian Years of Lead—were largely the same kind of people hired to be the state’s official killers, and they had extensive connections to state officials who could turn a blind eye when needed.</p> <p>Those of the new breed are a breed apart both demographically and ideologically.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> They are younger, less extroverted, less active in official politics, and much more besides. Their acts of violence are not obviously embedded in a broader social movement or institution. The US Department of Justice has a name for them: Nihilistic Violent Extremists (NVEs).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Researchers and journalists elsewhere, such as the Accelerationist Research Consortium (ARC), have borrowed the term accelerationist to describe them. Both of these names curiously elide the nazi link and thereby obfuscate the historical connection between this modern form of terror and its historical predecessors, instead opting to implicitly define it by its <em>exceptionality</em>, albeit in different ways.</p> <p>The most broadly accepted definition of ‘(militant) accelerationism’ in this context is, as far as I can tell, the one put forward by Matthew Kriner for the aforementioned ARC. It goes like this: “Militant accelerationism is a set of tactics and strategies designed to put pressure on and exacerbate latent social divisions, often through violence, thus hastening societal collapse.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> This definition has a few problems. Kriner essentially argues that “militant accelerationism” is an outgrowth of “philosophical forms of accelerationism—such as the technology-centric visions of Nick Land and the anti-colonial liberationist theories of left-accelerationists.” It is a “set of tactics and strategies” which “<em>grew</em> to include various ideological currents, the most dominant of which is neofascism” (my emphasis). Kriner <em>should</em> know that “accelerationist” tactics were being promoted and even put into practice by fascists (and homegrown American “patriots”) decades before Nick Land started blogging.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> <em>The Turner Diaries</em> was written all the way back in 1978, and various Nazi guides to ‘revolution’ have been easily accessible on the internet from the 1990s onward. The ARC definition both distorts the historical picture and obfuscates attempts to understand the so-called accelerationists as part of both the broader fascist social movement and the right in general, thus constructing ‘accelerationism’ as a historical and social anomaly that can only be defeated by police methods.</p> <p>The NVEs, meanwhile, are exceptional because they “engage in criminal conduct” in the pursuit of “goals that derive primarily from a hatred of society at large and a desire to bring about its collapse by sowing indiscriminate chaos, destruction, and social instability.” Ken Klippenstein notes that the term was created by the Trump II FBI “to replace the Biden administration’s focus on anti-government and ‘anti-authority’ extremism adopted after January 6,”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> but the appeal to “civilized society” found in the 2025 court documents ultimately occupies the same semiotic space as the Biden administration’s references to “anti-government” and “anti-authority” opinion. Moreover, “sowing indiscriminate chaos, destruction, and social instability” has been one of the main tools of US foreign policy for several decades now, and it is often difficult to find a coherent motive for such acts of wanton destruction beyond “hatred of society at large.” Take the 1998 destruction of the Al-Shifa medicine factory in Sudan.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> The alibi that they had intelligence it was a chemical weapons plant is only credible with the understanding that they also believed the Sudanese to be subhuman, a despised and cursed race, so verifying this intelligence was unnecessary. Racism is thus the most powerful vector of “nihilism,” that accursed alibi, in human history.</p> <p>There are further similarities between the agents of stochastic terror and the agents of the state. This is most clear when comparing their actions to those of the US military and especially its special forces (Navy SEALs, Delta Force, etc). What is a search and destroy operation after all? It is an act of targeted killing typically based on questionable intelligence and executed with the presupposition that anyone encountered along the way was either complicit or a witness, to be disposed of in any case. Normal rules of engagement and laws of war are suspended. Children become nothing more than extinguishable heat signatures.</p> <p>This is not to say that the killers are schooled in military technique: Most are (thankfully) relatively incompetent. I think the parallels are rather an example of action at a distance (and, of course, easy access to military-grade weaponry). When certain forms of violence are widely practiced and marked as legitimate by the state, this has far-reaching consequences for the use of violence throughout society. Police forces have increasingly grown to resemble the military over the past few decades, and today they are being joined everywhere by the National Guard and a completely militarized ICE. Even private security guards increasingly opt for a SWAT-style look. Given the continuous decline in violence that the US has experienced for decades, this is somewhat odd. There are economic explanations about the sale of surplus and used military equipment, but at a deeper level this militarism is, as the sociologists of the Bush era conjectured, a symptom of decline and the correlate expansion of the powers of fear and chaos.</p> <h2 id="vi---do-you-need-a-movement-to-be-a-fascist">VI - Do You Need a Movement to Be a Fascist?</h2> <p>The Order of Nine Angles and similar organizations may or may not exist—at least, they may or may not exist in the way that an organization such as the Dominican Order or Republican Party exists. We can be sure that there are individual adherents and that these individual adherents come together both in person and online. The most obvious trace of these organizations are the various artifacts that they leave behind: literature, online webpages and accounts, visual media, etc. Some authoritative fascist texts on strategy and organization—to the extent that they can be justly labeled that and not mere flights of political fantasy—outright reject large-scale organization in favor of small, cell-based or individual acts of terror. Their mantra: “You don’t need a movement to be a fascist.” Are they right?</p> <p>The first thing to note in answering his question is that when neo-nazis use the word “movement,” they mean a large-scale organization, not a social movement as such. One can certainly be a fascist without being a part of a large-scale organization. Being a fascist without being part of a social movement (namely the right in general) is, however, a historical impossibility, if not a strictly logical one. (I am emphasizing, once again, that the killers are objectively part of the same social movement as Fox News hosts.) Beyond that connection, sociologists and miscellaneous counter-terrorism/extremism researchers have done a decent job of mapping out the “accelerationist” movement in particular—although admittedly the subjects in question made this mapping process pretty easy with their atrocious operational security.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p> <p>What emerges instead of a single organization are interconnected networks of more and less committed individuals and the groups they form. At one end are the empty husks serving life sentences and writing letters by hand in the hole of a maximum security prison. At the other end are teenagers who repost ultra-nazi memes about the “day of the rope” because they think it’s funny. Between these individuated poles of the social movement are discrete groups formal and informal. If we imagine the social movement as a kind of two-dimensional graph with individuals and groups on one axis, then the other dimension would be the social infrastructure and institutional background that makes this social movement possible as an aggregate of human beings. That category would include digital means of communication and coordination, the broader global social movement of the right, and certain institutions of the state—insofar as they are actually involved.</p> <p>Despite the talk of “white jihad,” the organizational finesse of fascist terror groups pales in comparison to the likes of Al-Qaeda. The decentralization and network-based organizational structure of contemporary fascist terrorism is more a result of weakness and the congenital inability of these cretins to organize anything without the internet as a scaffold than deliberate strategy, despite their protestations to the contrary. Both as a mass and as individuals, they seem like highly manipulable actors. This is nothing new. The Italian fascist Enzo Erra, writing for the short-lived neo-fascist review <em>Imperium</em> in 1950, positively described the rank-and-file of the post-war neo-fascist movement as “a legion of true fanatics,” adding that “it is fanaticism that the revolution needs today.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Right-wing organizations are universally based on fear, trickery, irrational authority, backbiting, and the like. Dysfunction only seems to become more severe with illegal groups that have no real recourse to binding rules and bylaws.</p> <p>The right’s ‘intellectuals’ and leadership strata almost always believe they are getting one over on their simpleminded underlings. The political leadership is correct about this, the intellectuals less so. Traditional intellectuals, as Gramsci called them, have always been pawns of the real, political leadership, whose cultural standard is often rather poor. The right-wing Catholic intelligentsia uniformly falls in line behind Trump because he gives them what they want in exchange for obedience—endorsement of so many mortal sins is forgiven under plenary political indulgence. The grunts and lower level ‘intellectuals’ (today: podcasters, etc.) similarly follow the top dog’s diktat unswervingly. In the event that they do dissent, this is done with the awareness that they cannot risk straying too far from the path—to the extent that they are organic intellectuals they remain mere <em>organs</em> functionally subordinated to something greater.</p> <p>It was scandalous for Mario Borghezio, at the time a Member of European Parliament for the Lega Nord and himself a former cadre of the Italian neo-fascist movement, to publicly express his agreement with the beliefs (if not the actions) of Anders Breivik in 2011. (In the US, Glenn Beck compared the murdered children to members of the Hitler Youth, to give some idea of how the American right responded.)<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> The situation has evolved since then. Now the killers identify themselves with recognized political parties, which have largely absorbed the Luciferian impulse and bent it to their will. Thus the defense attorney of Patrick Crusius, the mass murderer and face behind the “Chudjak” meme, told <em>El Paso Matters</em> that his client “thought he had to stop the [Hispanic] invasion [of Texas] because that’s what his president was telling him.”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> For the attorney, this was evidence that Crusius was mentally unwell and, given he made similar arguments at his client’s sentencing hearing, also a possible extenuating circumstance. For us it is something different—even taking into account the perfidy inherent to lawyery! Young Republican activists’ private exaltation of rape as “epic” is the memetic afterbirth of the Order of Nine Angles’ radicalization of traditional right wing defenses of sexual violence into outright praise for it.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> The prodigal son has returned.</p> <p>From a historical perspective, passive, conservative reaction produces the activist right and maintains the latter as a kind of kept boy or covert bastard, but finds itself falling back on this apprentice in times of need. The ‘Alt-Right,’ as it used to be known, was an organizational failure, but it provided an impetus and cadre of footsoldiers that could reinvigorate the flailing organs of the Republican Party and help bring it to power. The ascendance of Trump seems, in retrospect, to be both highly contingent and the inevitable culmination of many deeper historical processes. That is normal. “<em>History</em> does <em>nothing</em>, it ‘possesses <em>no</em> immense wealth,’ it ‘wages <em>no</em> battles.’ It is <em>man</em>, real, living man who does all that, who possesses and fights; ‘history’ is not, as it were, a person apart, using man as a means to achieve <em>its own</em> aims; history is <em>nothing but</em> the activity of man pursuing his aims.”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p> <h2 id="vii---special-bodies-of-armed-men">VII - Special Bodies of Armed Men</h2> <p>The German-Jewish jurist Ernst Fraenkel introduced the term dual state to describe the legal structure of the Third Reich.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> He argued that the Nazi state was divided into a “prerogative state” and a “normative state.” The former was a basically political body unconcerned with formal procedure and governed by a hierarchical chain of command ultimately terminating in the will of the <em>Führer</em>, while the latter represented the institutions governing “normal life,” in particular the regulation of private property. Crucially, the relationship between these two states was combative: the former possessed potentially unlimited jurisdiction, and new exceptions to the normative legal order could be called into existence at any moment.</p> <p>Fraenkel’s picture, of course, does not map perfectly onto the present, but insofar as there are any attempts to make real changes in the structure of the US government today, these attempts are characterized by a dualism of exception and norm like that of the double state. The old style of unified, legally structured racial apartheid and blatant class domination that characterized the Solid South would be difficult if not impossible to restore, certainly within the span of a single presidential term, and so it seems to me that one of the main goals of the American right in this moment is to establish a kind of deformed double state without recourse to a full-on declaration of martial law or <em>autogolpe</em>. Indeed, one of the distinguishing characteristics of this ‘late fascism’ is its pointed avoidance of the totalizing rhetoric of a Mussolini or Hitler—Stephen Miller’s vituperative discourse notwithstanding.</p> <p>The preferential vehicle for such a transformation today is the executive branch, the decrepit head of which is argued to already hold “plenary authority” by his aforementioned scheming vizier,<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> but any part of the state will work in a pinch. (Indeed, some on the right are rather perturbed by Trump’s attempts to circumvent the sham judiciary they’ve cultivated for decades. In the case against Mahmoud Khalil, the State’s legal team is trying to get the case trapped in the immigration courts, which as administrative courts are not actually part of the judiciary and, since the unitarity of the executive has been all but ceded by the Supreme Court, therefore fall under the control of the President—a possible vessel for a system of <em>Sondergerichte</em>? But let me not digress too much.) The technique is a matter of combining finesse with bravado. For every spectacular episode of ethnic cleansing in the barrio, there are several less publicized agreements made and intragovernmental <em>Drumpfschaltung</em> campaigns enacted. When one plot against the human race is foiled—the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” concentration camp, for example—another one is quickly devised and a step-by-step program to realize it is set in motion. While Federalist Society bigwigs no doubt have some fears that Trump will blow his load prematurely and ruin all their hard work, as he genuinely seemed to have done for a moment back on January 6, 2021, one can rest assured that they will keep their disagreements civil. It’s not like they have any other horses to bet on.</p> <p>Political maneuvers like the ones I just described mainly serve to concentrate power, but beyond the short-term schematics of Project 2025 there is little indication of long term planning. For all the right’s unity, policy continues to prove a stumbling block. ‘More of everything worse, less of everything good’ seems an adequate summary of the vision for now. Historian Nicholas Nagy-Talavera remarked of Count Gyula Károlyi, one time Prime Minister of Hungary under Admiral Horthy, that for even a relatively well-meaning reactionary paternalist such as Károlyi, the content of reforms mattered less than the fact that they came from above.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Such is the case too with whatever seemingly ameliorative reforms are floated in the pages of Project 2025 or blurted out by Trump. Among the rank-and-file society is considered a zero sum game, and it is therefore assumed that punishment and deprivation must automatically result in redistribution. This is one reason for attacking immigrants, but it has clear limits.</p> <p>The United States depends heavily on the labor of undocumented workers, as everyone knows. Breaking the back of agricultural capital to mandate higher wages and make the work attractive to citizens is not on the agenda, nor can “people that live in the inner city,” as Trump euphemistically called them,<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> be forced back to the fields. There is no clear way out, thus in the absence of any coherent plan, a white terror (literally!) is devised. The only real goal of it seems to be social and legal de-integration of immigrants (if not the outright dis-integration of immigrant communities), which is a prerequisite for the construction of any satisfactorily inhumane and bloodsucking solution to the ‘immigration question,’ as it used to be called.</p> <p>In Spring of this year, Trump and Grand Poobah Miller attempted to deploy a shoddy legal argument that members of Tren de Aragua, a previously obscure Venezuelan gang, were “conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States”<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> under orders from Nicolas Maduro and therefore eligible for detainment and expulsion under the Alien Enemies Act—and also that a number of random Venezuelan immigrants plucked off the street were in fact hardened enforcers and saboteurs for this outfit. They’ve since backed off from this argument—mainly because it wasn’t working in court—but have continued pursuing external aggression against the Bolivarian Republic by arbitrarily murdering Venezuelan boatmen with drone strikes. This blatant provocation is justified by smearing the boats as drug smuggling vessels whose freight was en route to the US. War is thus justified by a failed internal policy in order to retroactively justify this policy, which was itself intended to justify the war.</p> <p>I saw a video recently of a masked skull-cracker—whether he was ICE or CBP I could not discern—incredulously asking a bystander, “How am I a Nazi?” In the back seat of his paddywagon was, of course, a restrained Latino man. All reporting on the farcical recruitment campaign being pursued by the Department of Homeland Security—a “shit show”<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> according to an anonymous administration source—has driven home the same conclusion suggested by that video: ICE hopefuls are uniquely stupid, callous, and bellicose. The pseudonymous Yanis Varoufuckice recounted his (?) experiences talking with men who variously claimed to have seen video evidence of the Taliban at a fast-food restaurant or wanted to rid Times Square of “savages.”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> Most characteristic—a real patriot cannot stand to see his nation’s shrines to Mammon defiled by dusky brutes!</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting specimen from Mssr. Varoufuckice’s account, however, is the man who really just wanted to “[parlay] his wages as a deportation officer into buying Airbnbs.” That too is characteristic, and gels nicely with the reports of NPR and the New York Times. The former pointed out the moderate views on immigration held by some applicants and the apathetic order-follower attitude of others,<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> while the latter noted the presence of “a large number of working-class African American and Hispanic men”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> and several naturalized aspirants at a Texas hiring fair. This indicates that while some wanted to bust heads, a fair number viewed being a deportation officer as a job like any other. (I knew a guy who briefly worked at a temporary immigration ‘intake’ facility for undocumented children during the first months of the Biden admin, a lifelong democratic voter whose parents are immigrants—to him it was just a job. Never underestimate the power of money!) But anyway, I can’t imagine that attitude lasts long in the line of duty. Even if the recruits did not come in as recipients of political spoils, they will leave that way. One cannot pursue a career hunting ‘tonks’—Border Patrol slang for immigrants that originated as onomatopoeia for the sound made when a human skull is struck with a metal flashlight—and expect to come out the other side an even-keeled moderate.</p> <p>Expanding the repressive apparatus is essentially the only attempt that the right has made to mollify rather than exacerbate the looming crisis of the middle classes, which has its roots in the inability of capital to expand fast enough to absorb labor-power whether skilled or unskilled. In a perverse way it seems almost hopeful to imagine that these utter rubes are being cultivated as a state within the state. They will be less a coherent body like the SS, more a strategic node among others for transforming the structure of the state into a shape more favorable to the right.</p> <h2 id="viii---in-the-style-of-demons">VIII - In the Style of Demons</h2> <p>Clichés about the right’s ability to learn from the left are grossly overstated and almost obfuscate the role of money and class power in the right’s successes. Commitment to slower-paced strategies that make use of civil society were not learned from the left. Civil society is making its last stand in the US today—in many places its independent existence has already been annihilated by the State and/or capital—for both the right and bourgeois liberalism.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> In the event that the former is victorious, people will perhaps finally learn that civil society is not an unalloyed good, or indeed necessarily a good at all.</p> <p>A key component of the decay of civil society is the decline of religion in America, a process that has been correlated with the ascendence of the religious right. That movement, which we can see as being born in response to school desegregation on one hand and <em>Roe v. Wade</em> on the other, took decades to build the influence it presently wields.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Religious actors have political sway because they can mobilize their base, not because their beliefs are popular or even necessarily representative of their correligionists. Churches are one of the last real holdouts of classical, palm-greasing machine politics.</p> <p>It has always been obvious that Christianity is a lever of social authority with regard to the family—if one drives around the South they will sooner or later encounter billboards proclaiming that to spare the rod is to spoil the child. The role of the religion in legitimizing and organizing violence against women and children, trivial to demonstrate, often goes unacknowledged outside of the political-intellectual ghettos of militant atheism and feminism. (One is hard-pressed to find militant atheism even among self-proclaimed Communists today!) It is unlikely that all the legal and political victories of the feminist movement (e.g. sexual harassment law) will be able to withstand an all-out campaign to destroy them, even if certain protections can be maintained at state and local levels. Mores will be harder to directly change, but they are also an area where the victories have been more uneven. Women cannot be forced out of work at this point, but their situation can be made worse and more precarious in innumerable ways.</p> <p>If it is uncomfortable for many to confront the patriarchal role of the Christian churches, then the racial element in them is noted even more rarely. On one hand there is a racialized Protestant work ethic wielded against sections of the working class (themselves overwhelmingly Christian), and on the other Christianity functions as a more explicit codeword for white against middle class minorities and immigrants (who may or may not be Christian). In both cases it also encodes settlerism as a particular valence of whiteness. Allowances are made for conservative Black and Latino churches willing to admit the moral depravity of their neighbors and join in the struggle against the ways of the world, but evangelism to immigrants is out of the question.</p> <p>Part of the reason that conversion therapy (another gift of civil society!) is so repulsive is that it violates freedom of thought, traditionally considered the basis of so many other rights. I doubt that many bigots grasp the violence wrought by the love of the sinner and hatred of sin—charity does not “cover the multitude of sins,” as Peter taught, but in fact creates that multitude, as Wilde observed. It is in this Christian universe of discourse that Randy Shumway, chair of Utah’s state Homeless Services Board and alum of a bank founded by his polygamist pedophile prophet, the “Lion of the Lord” Brigham Young, by the name of Zions Bancorporation, can say that his plans to build an “accountability center” for the homeless—<em>also ein Kameradschaftslager?</em>—will put a stop to the “culture of permissiveness” prevailing amongst them and redirect them “towards human flourishing.”<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> That is compassionate conservatism! The suggestion that being put in a cage has anything to do with <em>flourishing</em>—that should be enough of a sign that we are reading the words of an assassin.</p> <p>The defense of the patriarchal family and jealous guarding of control over education is at least one area where cruelty, far from being “the point,” is quite functional. Childhood is the ground floor of domination, a time in life where coercion and persuasion are mixed freely. While the positive side of education is difficult to engineer, deprivation is trivial. Once you’ve given up on the future, it is easy to sacrifice someone else’s child for an uncertain short-term advantage. (We’ve only been doing it for thousands, if not millions, of years!) Even if the overall funding pool remained the same—and it will not—so-called “school choice” laws will transfer power to reactionary elements in civil society, especially the churches. Under a full “school choice” system, school segregation would explode to levels not seen since before <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>. Private schools are, moreover, legally permitted to beat children in almost every state of the Union, a privilege jealously guarded by religious fundamentalists of every confession: The government of New York was prompted to put the kibosh on beating in private schools in 2023 (!) because of the extent of its use in Hasidic yeshivas in particular.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p> <p>Beating of children may be on the decline, but they are exposed to other dangers, the most pressing of which is the vacuousness of their futures. Even the scions of the ruling class have little left to do but enjoy themselves before last call in the millennium. In the meantime, a school system which does not even have the well-meaning barbarity to funnel the proletarian urchins it’s responsible for into polytechnical schools and dump them on the streets by age sixteen oversees a collapse in literacy. The very idea of public education is founded on a liberal idea of progress inextricable from the historical arc of capitalist civilization, an arc which is now stumbling and seems poised to lunge into the abyss.</p> <h2 id="ix---children-of-rage">IX - Children of Rage</h2> <blockquote> <p>“People say, how can I help on this war against terror? How can I fight evil? You can do so by mentoring a child; by going into a shut-in’s house and say I love you.” —President George W. Bush</p> </blockquote> <p>Between the time I started writing this essay and when I sat to finish it, multiple O9A terror attacks occurred in different parts of the globe. On the morning of the day I am writing, November 7th, 2025, a bomb attack took place at a high school’s mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia that injured over fifty people.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> At the scene of the crime, a replica assault rifle was discovered. It was emblazoned with numerous anti-Muslim, Nazi, and school shooting slogans and symbols: the triple cross of the Romanian Iron Guard, the phrase <em>natural selection</em>, the number 14, references to Charles Martel and the Battle of Tours, the names of anti-Muslim terrorists, and on the barrel <em>For Agartha</em>—a reference to esoteric Nazism popularized by right-wing memes. The suspect is seventeen years old.</p> <p>A little over a week before this, on the 28th of October, the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior announced the arrest of a fourteen year old boy in connection to an international extortion network connected to thirty incidents of suicide and other acts of violence. The boy allegedly coordinated this campaign through the game Roblox. “We received information through international cooperation that someone was luring victims to harm themselves, writing their names in blood on their bodies, and inciting violence, psychological abuse, suicide, and arson, including burning their homes and belongings, even animals,” an official announced to the press in front of AI generated graphics of a Roblox character and a boy in an orange prison jumpsuit.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> One of the officials repeatedly gestured to the image, which clearly featured the logo of Google’s Gemini AI service in the bottom right-hand corner, and referenced “the boy you see before you,” implying the chimeric image depicted the actual suspect. No mention was made of O9A, 764, incels, or anything of that nature, but the parallels were immediately clear.</p> <p>These people, the killers, are probably not misunderstood kids with noble souls deep down. Everything I read about every one of these individuals leads me to see them as unpleasant types, and stupid as well. Their backgrounds are often somewhat misfortunate—recall the gentleman with the cleft palate mentioned in the Overture—but ultimately well within the socially accepted parameters of misery. In other words, there is nothing special about them, nothing singular. They are statistical products as much as anyone else.</p> <p>I cannot recall an instance in which one of these killers or would-be killers got onto the stand and made a convincing performance of madness, either.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> (The relevance of mental illness and its extent among killers is also disputed in the quantitative literature on the topic.) They all seem to understand quite well what they did or planned to do. If the O9A teenagers believe (whatever that means!) in a magical Nazi alien named Drill Sergeant Grey—and I really must emphasize that I am not making that up—this does not make them any more insane than someone who claims to have a ‘personal relationship with God.’ Can we confidently say that there is a difference in kind between a Columbine-worshipping true crime community member and a Swiftie? Things change once violence is committed, but the majority of school shooting fans treat massacres as young people treat any other fandom.</p> <p>So goes the story: a quiet but nice boy becomes increasingly withdrawn and consumed with screens. Maladaptive online interactions with a nefarious anti-social group clouds out happiness. An intolerable split between online identity and meatspace existence emerges. What is his relation to society? A yearning for recognition, satisfaction, and pleasure that becomes a vengeful demand. The entire breadth of their desire is epitomized in one killer’s repeated Google searches for “school shooter porn.”<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> Even in its explicitly political incarnations, this kind of youth terror is an assertion of the private life of power, to use a compelling phrase from Corey Robin.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> Acts of internet incubated individual terror are a depoliticized species of political action. Allowing myself to lapse into Habermasianism for a moment, I would call such violence a protest against the colonization of the human lifeworld by the strategic paradigm of the class state and capitalist economy, outrage at the impossibility of community, acceptance, and belonging being given in any way except by grace alone. Whereas that triad cannot be extracted by violence, their subjective correlates (recognition, satisfaction, and pleasure) can, and their negative counterparts can be briefly forgotten amidst the bloodshed.</p> <p>All the clichés from 20th century social theory about anomie, alienation, malaise, social dislocation, etc. have found their moment of truth today, but one recent addition to that pile struck me as especially relevant to this phenomenon. Roberto Unger introduced the word <em>belittlement</em> to describe what Lacanian psychoanalysts previously referred to as <em>castration</em>, i.e. the inherent unsatisfiability of desire. Jonathan Crary has wagered that the internet—and, one might add, the entire repertoire of capitalist culture—has produced a localized proof of Unger (and Lacan’s) theorems by making belittlement into a transcendental condition of participation in a whole region of human life.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> Even if desire has always been unsatisfiable, we did not always have this transcendental fact rubbed into our faces 24/7. More than anything, these acts of violence are a rebellion against belittlement. That negative content eclipses the positive longings.</p> <p>Whether or not the killers planned to commit suicide in advance, and many do, they almost invariably decide to do so in the moment because it saves them from the humiliating ritual of explaining their idiotic beliefs and performing their cringe-worthy personas in front of the world that they hated. One can detect a crushing fear of being belittled once again—a psychiatrist described the multi-media manifesto package sent to NBC by the Virginia Tech killer as “a PR tape of him trying to turn himself into a Quentin Tarantino character.”<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> (The more ideologically coherent Nazis do not commit suicide because for them it really is propaganda of the deed. Their milieu is just distinct enough to make a difference.) If they die—after livestreaming their spree to friends on Discord, of course—they will become martyrs, special ones venerated more like Kurt Cobain or Vincent van Gogh as men “suicided by society”<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> than properly political martyrs.</p> <p>But in a certain sense they are political martyrs. The Satanic Nazism of O9A found an elective affinity with school massacres for reasons beyond mutual attraction to the heinous. The worldview—if it can be called that—typically expressed in the manifestos of prima facie apolitical killers is, upon further examination, intensely reactionary.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> James Mason, in what seemed like idiotic insanity at the time, tried to forge a connection between Nazi terrorism and the world of spectacular crime by pitching Charles Manson as a kind of Aryan prophet in the 1980s, and by making connections with counter-culture scenester fascists he was able to have his obscure newsletter reprinted numerous times, such that it eventually fell into the hands of the users of Ironmarch, who sought to prove Mason’s interpretation right. With all this in mind, the formation of Satanic Nazi terrorist cults dedicated to sexually exploiting children (764) and grooming them into committing violent crimes (the Ukrainian-Russian ‘Maniacs Murder Cult’) makes more sense.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> (Also, these cult/terror networks seem to themselves be largely made up of teenagers and young adults.) Either ‘accelerationists’ adopted their particular style of sanctifying killers from teenage true crime fans or the two practices evolved in parallel.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> Their grooming tactics, which they claim to have learned from studying FBI manuals,<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> also bear a striking resemblance to the organically emergent modes of commiseration and maladaptive sociality endemic to the true crime community and related online subcultures.</p> <p>What is the bigger scandal—that Nazi Satanists are grooming children to self-harm and commit school shootings or that children were already doing such things with no Satanic influence? Is the addition of pentagrams and swastikas enough to make people care? A single instance of mass murder committed by a teenager should be sufficient cause for a society to turn itself inside out looking for answers and solutions.</p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>The old kind of extra-legal-but-still-state-affiliated killers still exist, and not just in the US; just look at Israel and especially India for a truly by the book example. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>Ken Klippenstein, “What are ‘Nihilistic Violent Extremists’?” <a href="http://kenklippenstein.com"><em>kenklippenstein.com</em></a> (blog), 04/15/2025. <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/what-are-nihilist-violent-extremists">https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/what-are-nihilist-violent-extremists</a> <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Matthew Kriner, “An Introduction to Militant Accelerationism,” <em>Accelerationism Research Consortium</em>, 05/9/2022, <a href="https://www.accresearch.org/shortanalysis/an-introduction-to-militant-accelerationism">https://www.accresearch.org/shortanalysis/an-introduction-to-militant-accelerationism</a> <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>To the extent that he is aware of the history, he distorts it.

Even those on the right rarely enquire what being there means. Moreover, in the event that they do pose this question, their answers are universally more mystifying than clarifying—often deliberately so, I might add. When we on the left pose the question, points of clarification are immediately demanded. Are we asking at the level of sociology? (In which case we are really asking <em>who</em> is the Right?) Politics? History? Psychology? <em>Which</em> Right? Fascist, conservative, liberal, autocratic, agrarian, Christian, Kahanist, Salafist, or some other?</p> <p>I am not particularly interested in asking or answering such questions. The Right is a historical concept; its meaning cannot be fixed easily, or perhaps at all. On the intellectual front, their output is too flimsy, incoherent, and downright stupid to form the theme of an investigation unless one adopts a deliberately simplified and narrowly philosophical frame like rationalism vs. irrationalism. Dominant psychological types can be described and a certain psychological home terrain can be delineated, but these efforts run the risk of falling back into an untenable reliance on the psychological as <em>the</em> explanans of social life, rather than something which is simultaneously explanans and explanandum in relation to society.</p> <p>My approach here is political in a broad sense while also acknowledging the sociological, psychological, and cultural moments.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This essay is, at base, an attempt to ‘seek truth from facts,’ so to speak. I want to show the basic unity of what I am calling the Right in a theoretical, rather than historical—or, for that matter, <em>conspiratorial</em>—manner, with reference to the theme of violence.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> In a certain sense, this is a way of doing unto others as they have done unto us. We on the left are already lumped into one big category; there is a specially designed socio-legal wastebasket taxon just for us (for more thereabout, see Section II below). The overall structure of these reflections is somewhat interrupted by the necessity of publishing them in two parts.</p> <p>So much for prolegomenizing. Let’s look at an example. The official story is that a US Army soldier, one Jarret William Smith, was arrested for unwittingly sending IED recipes and bombing plans to an undercover FBI agent posing as a fellow member of an online neo-nazi group founded and led by a thirteen year-old Estonian boy who went by “Commander.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Immediately one must ask questions. Does a thirteen year old (and a rather immature one at that, judging by his leaked chats<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>) have the organizational chops to run an international—members were also arrested in the UK, Croatia, Lithuania, and Germany—terrorist outfit? The FBI were clearly present in the chatroom. How real were these plots? How many undercovers were in the group? Were any other intelligence agencies there? Was the whole thing a false flag or pseudo-gang? Entrapment seems possible, but we can never know. The full story lives only with people who will never talk. Interestingly enough, it seems that Smith did not attempt any kind of entrapment defense. Instead, he pled guilty and then tried to mitigate his sentence with various feckless arguments: He had depression, he was born with a cleft palate, he “yearn[ed] for acceptance,” and so on.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> In other words, his own defense was that he was so mentally weak as to be taken in by the questionable charisma of Feuerkrieg Division’s prepubescent Commander.</p> <p>There is some more relevant background here. The name Feuerkrieg Division was clearly inspired by the American organization Atomwaffen Division (AwD). The latter was founded in 2015 by members of the forum Ironmarch, a spinoff of the more famous Stormfront for only the most radical of nazis. Brandon Russel, considered AwD’s founder, was only twenty years old at the time. Devon Arthurs, another founding member and former roommate of Russel who is serving a 45 year sentence for a double murder of two other Atomwaffen members committed in 2017 when he was eighteen, would have been just sixteen when Atomwaffen was founded. Although they seem to have disbanded around 2024, their influence is still strongly felt in the neo-nazi scene. Their key inspiration was the obscure figure James Mason, an American neo-nazi (and pedophile, allegedly) who claimed Charles Manson as a positive example for ‘The Movement’ and advocated committing individual acts of terroristic violence—including, comically, killing mailmen in particular—to bring about a race war. Another influence on certain members of Atomwaffen was the Order of Nine Angles (O9A). O9A is a secretive Satanist-cum-Neo-Nazi (or Neo-Nazi-cum-Satanist, depending on which account you believe) ‘organization’ that originated as a Wiccan group before being taken over by one David Myatt (pseudonymously known as Anton Long) in the mid 1970s. (I put ‘organization’ in inverted commas because it’s unclear to what extent it exists as a real group and not merely a set of diversely authored texts and self-proclaimed representatives.) O9A is infamous for their promotion of human sacrifice, pedophilia, and rape, among other atrocious things, and the credible links between the so-called Order (or at least its ideas) and actual acts of terrorism, murder, and sex crimes.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p> <p>The Order and related groups are one of the focal points of this essay because they represent the furthest point in the right, a sort of <em>finis terrae politicae</em> and thematic North Star for that reason. I am, however, trying to avoid turning this endeavor into a study of salacious neo-nazis, so enough about the Commander. Enough rudimentary genealogy of his movement. Let’s look at the case of a different demonic youth.</p> <h2 id="i---collateral-social-murder">I - Collateral Social Murder</h2> <p>Who is Big Balls? Nineteen year old Edward Cortistine enjoyed a career as an online scammer, computer science freelancer, and founder of a handful of rather stupid seeming tech startups before stumbling into the opportunity of a lifetime: a post in Washington, DC at Elon Musk’s Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE).<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> It seems that he was associated in some way with a group known as The Com, an online community of cybercriminals distributed across messaging platforms like Discord and Telegram that is closely linked to 764, a different online cult/criminal organization inspired by the Order of Nine Angles and similarly dedicated to pedophilia, sexual blackmail, grooming children, and so on.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p> <p>(A brief aside: Everyone on the right, from Big Balls to Trump himself, takes pleasure in playing the <em>pig killing game</em> in all its sundry forms. “Bears make money; bulls make money; pigs get slaughtered,” as the saying goes. Take, for example, the case of ‘Remilia Corp,’ the group behind the Milady NFT. On the surface, it is a scummy online cult-turned-crypto firm run by one Rohit (AKA “Krishna”) Ohkandiar—himself the scion of a wealthy family and formerly employed by Palantir—with connections to several other image-obsessed right wing firms funded by Peter Thiel and co (e.g. ‘Praxis’). There are credible allegations, however, that the leadership of Remilia has engaged in acts of grooming and sexual blackmail with a strikingly similar MO to that of 764. Last I heard, Ohkandiar himself was being sued by his co-founders for stealing 1.7 million dollars from them after they were forced to sideline him for his racism, pedophilia, and cult-like activities. So it goes.)</p> <p>On August 5, it was reported that Big Balls was jumped by some teenagers in Washington DC the previous Sunday. Right wing media initially claimed that the youths shouted, “This is Kamala country!” while clobbering him. By Monday the 11th, Trump had taken federal control of the DC police force and ordered the national guard deployed to the city. The attack on Big Balls, who was now being considered for a Presidential Medal of Freedom, was transparently the justification for this move. Comparisons with Horst Wessel, the SA member who became the most important martyr of the Nazi party, began immediately.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p> <p>But Horst Wessel was a small-time crook only elevated to fame after his idiotic death in a petty squabble. Big Balls is part of a team who will be responsible for millions of deaths in the Third World. The goal of DOGE was never simply austerity, as Musk’s ouster over a row about deficit spending demonstrated. The destruction of USAID is, in its consequences for human life, an act that recalls the Nazi Hunger Plan, yet it was seemingly devised as part of some crude political game—one notably designed by a ketamine-addled Afrikaner megalomaniac. This is an act of social murder on a planetary scale that is being executed to prove some oblique point in Babylon’s political contest, extermination as a form of trolling. At time of writing, one estimate puts the additional deaths resulting from the cuts at over 520,000 so far, with over 355,000 of those being children.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> An article in <em>The Lancet</em> estimates that over 14 million people will die by 2030 if the cuts are not reversed or made up for by some other source.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p> <p>Of course, all the people responsible hate Black people and all Africans—African countries being many of the main recipients of aid from USAID with regard to disease prevention and treatment—but this act seems just as defined by callousness and the rules of the political game as by negrophobic spleen. Few who die as a result of the DOGE boys’ wanton cruelty will know the names, faces, or motives of their murderers: They will just run out of medicine. Furthermore, the abandonment of the goal of biopolitical stability foreshadows a brutal reinforcement of the existing cordon sanitaire around the mother continent. The world-historical meaning of the Mediterranean for the human race will be overshadowed by its role as a moat for keeping the darker races out of Europe.</p> <p>Another reason to doubt that this is a purely racist or economic act is that the same party is doing the same things in their own country with similarly disastrous results expected. Legalistic shake-ups of the CDC and its vaccine recommendations and the recent declaration that the State of Florida will suspend all vaccine mandates will have a similar effect: denying medicine to the poor, to the workers, and undermining the herd immunity effect that vaccination and other preventative public health measures establish. It is hard to see any possible economic benefits to these measures beyond a ludicrous gamble on (1) the possibilities unleashed by creative destruction and (2) the extent to which force can serve as an economical alternative for welfare institutions. The campaign of social murder therefore appears to be a kind of gigantic, planet-wide biopolitical experiment.</p> <h2 id="ii---i-want-to-try-and-get-to-heaven">II - I Want to Try and Get to Heaven</h2> <p>The six year old daughter of a Texas Mennonite family died from measles earlier this year. She was, of course, unvaccinated. “The measles wasn’t that bad,”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> the girl’s mother claimed in an interview with the anti-vaccine organization Children’s Health Defense (formerly chaired by RFK Jr.). The quack doctor who ‘treated’ their daughter as she died was “amazing” and “great,” the father maintained. Answering a question about their opinion on measles and whether or not they would vaccinate their children after what they had experienced, they gradually lapsed into Low German dialect. “Es was nich so bad,” the mother reiterated in Platt-Denglisch. “The measles are good for the body, for the people,” the father added in English. I cannot follow what exactly they said in Low German after this. The translator present at the interview glossed it as “It was her time on Earth […] she’s better off where she is now.”</p> <p>“If I can save seven thousand people a week from being killed, I think that’s a pre—I want to try and get to heaven if possible. I’m hearing I’m not doing well.” Thus spoke the President of the United States of America.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> He was clearly being somewhat facetious, but the statement reflects the paralyzing fear of death that characterizes everyone in the present, but especially the right. The Mennonite parents (who were presumably vaccinated against measles as children) showed recklessness, not bravery, in sacrificing their child on the altar of alternative medicine. They themselves were never in any danger. They did not look death in the eye.</p> <p>“Natural immunity” is a biopolitical critique of biopolitics. The outrage over RFK Jr.’s “miasma theory” is misplaced: it presupposes the reality of germ theory, but offers something like a ‘spatial fix.’ True, proponents of alternative medicine never worked a maternity ward before Semmelweis and Pasteur, but they don’t have to. They know the figures of maternal or infant mortality are moral blackmail, the revenge of the sick on the healthy. For the enlightened anti-vaxxer, the real immunity of the vaccine is the death of freedom. The measles are <em>‘nich so bad.’</em> The survival of autistic children, a holocaust.</p> <p>Preventative medicine is poison; nothing good can come from alien biota. <em>Be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh</em>.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Only dead things may enter the body, and in continuously bracing itself for the worst, the body itself ceases to live and becomes an inanimate suit of muscular armor fueled by exogenous testosterone. The obsession with ‘mewing’ and other boutique mandibular exercises reveals itself as a sublimation of the same drive-derivative behind teeth grinding and the wish to bite: revenges of the angry infant that doesn’t want to eat.</p> <p>Health and wellness is, we are told, an inherent property of the people (for whom the measles are good). “The Amish,” whom white Americans see as forefathers out of time rather than contemporaries, “have no autism” whatsoever!<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> If <em>nos ancêtres les Amish</em> have no autism, and we proud Americans do, then this can only be the result of corruption, what one right wing author has called the “Medical Assault on the American Brain.” Look around: factory farms, hormone-loaded beef, genetically altered spuds, questionable medicaments, poisonous painkillers, high fructose corn slurry—how can any of this be good for us? Make no mistake: much of it is bad, quick fixes that cause problems (and profits) at the same rate that they solve them, but diagnosing the counter-revolution in healthcare as a distorted, symptomatic reaction to the hurt that has accompanied the real medical advances of the past two hundred years has its limits. On one hand it runs the risk of reducing politics to pathology, and on the other it fails to inquire <em>why</em> social symptom formation has taken such a reactionary course.</p> <p>Here, then, is a hypothesis: All this pathological fear of disease and contamination, of “mind viruses” and “social contagions,” is at some level a functional response by the immune system of hegemony, so to speak. This hatred is grounded, to some extent, in an awareness (conscious or otherwise) that the ideologies, institutions, and psychological structures that keep this machine running are vulnerable to subversion.</p> <p>All that is Black, foreign, queer, communist, liberal, anarchist, whatever—it’s all the same dirty, revolting substance. This is the explicit argument of a recent piece of American right wing, Nietzsche 4 Dummies pablum, the book <em>Unhumans: The Secret History of Communist Revolutions (And How to Stop Them)</em> by Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec:</p> <blockquote> <p>History does not repeat, but it rhymes. For as long as there have been beauty and truth, love and life, there have also been the ugly liars who hate and kill. This is the way of things in all things. There is light and there is dark. Always has been. Always will be. Civilization is the superstructure built on law and order that keeps the petty, the resentful, and the cruel away from the rest of us. Some societies have been better at this than others. Those who fail at repelling the repulsive fall to unhumanity—to a state of affairs in which human thriving is impossible and surviving improbable.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Similar sentiments are expressed in so many words by much of the conservative establishment, whether publicly or privately. The threat is formed <em>e pluribus unum</em>. The adversary uniformly possesses the same generic being, little more than social vermin. She is legion, for they/them are many.</p> <p>But do we not tell a very similar story? At least since the New Left it has been accepted—rightly, I might add—that the so-called ‘new social movements’ (feminism, gay/queer liberation, ecology, anti-racism, immigrants’ rights, etc.) are crucial parts of the socialist (I would even say <em>communist</em>) package. And we have been (re-) discovering since then that many of these factors were even acknowledged by Marx, Engels, and the like in rudimentary ways. Not every ‘new social movement’ has genuine revolutionary implications in and of itself, but a genuine revolution implies the resolution of the conflicts which made these social movements necessary.</p> <h2 id="iii---the-ku-klux-klan-is-back-but-now-it-is-the-most-powerful-agency-in-human-history">III - The Ku Klux Klan Is Back, But Now It Is the Most Powerful Agency in Human History</h2> <blockquote> <p>Only a few days after the Utøya massacre, Mario Borghezio, a representative of the Italian Northern League and member of the European Parliament, lauded Anders Breivik’s manifesto. Live on Italian state radio, Borghezio claimed that he shared Breivik’s ‘opposition to Islam’, including his call for a ‘crusade’ by Christians against Europe’s ‘drift toward Islam’. He then added that positions like Breivik’s ‘account for 20 per cent of votes in Europe’, and that ‘100 million people think this way’. In a separate interview with Il Sole-24 radio station, Mr Borghezio declared that the ideas expressed by Breivik are generally ‘good barring the violence – and some of them are great’. I don’t think that Borghezio is far from the truth when he asserts that 100 million Europeans would agree with Breivik’s thought, as espoused in his Declaration. The text of the murderer perfectly expresses the feelings and opinions of a large portion of the European people, not to mention Americans. These opinions are not the product of madness or of a crazy delirium, but the rational neo-conservative elaborations of a right-wing idiot who thinks that European identity is based on the Christian faith and that Islam is the worst enemy of Europe, which has to be confronted and rejected by any means necessary. What Breivik writes might be signed in full and almost without correction by the neo-conservative intellectuals and the Tea Party militants of the United States.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Bifo was writing in 2015 about an event that occurred in 2011. In a 2025 article on the subject of mass shootings, he correctly notes that such massacres “have become a common fact of life.”<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> It’s not just for white men (although they continue to predominate): People of any race and gender can commit these acts of violence. For Bifo, this is a sign that we are living in “the age of extermination.” Agreement with the opinions of the killers has also grown: Keir Starmer has lately decided to try domesticating the racist demon that holds dominion over so many of his countrymen for the purposes of the Labour Party instead of fighting it. Berardi summarizes the state of the world succinctly: “The Ku Klux Klan is back, but now it is the most powerful agency in human history.”</p> <p>A number of Bifo’s recent essays have touched on a sort of leftist appropriation of Spengler’s organicist conception of history. Instead of searching for a spiritual angle from which to specify and analyze the decline of the West—Bifo actually calls it a “mutation,” not a decline—and its causes, however, he points to a more directly biological (or biopolitical) factor: the aging of the population in Western countries due to the prolongation of lifespans and decrease in birthrates.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> A laundry list of symptoms is brought forth: There is “loss of memory, mental confusion, marasmus, and finally, furious aggressiveness for the humiliation and impotence that the fall of energy has provoked,” but also a “post-alphabetical” mentality among the young, who are permeated by an air of all-encompassing dysphoria that manifests as “anxiety, depression, and panic syndrome.”<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> This biopolitical condition manifests as a “cyclone” of racism, nationalism, and “senescent despair and furious revenge against the senile humiliation.”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> The automata of 21st century capitalist material culture (inclusive of digital infrastructure) exist in a “violent symbiotic relationship” with these forces of chaos simultaneously puerile and senile, holding them back and emboldening them at the same time.</p> <p>Delirious acts of hatred and rage will continue to proliferate, Bifo tells us, but with an important caveat: “American society will not be destroyed by this proliferation, however, because American society has always been based on violence, fear, and dementia.” I think he is right about that. A preponderance of great American authors—Hawthorne, Melville, Faulkner, Burroughs, etc—have thematized this world-historical delirium (to paraphrase Deleuze). Hawthorne’s dialogue between Goodman Brown and the Devil, in which the adversary tells the young Salemite of how he assisted his Puritan ancestors in abusing Quakers and burning Native American villages, is characteristic, as is the climax of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> where Henry Sutpen murders his half-brother Charles before he has the chance to marry their (half-) sister Judith not because of the consanguineous nature of the union, for he has already made peace with incest, but because he has learned that Charles has African ancestry.</p> <p>Even though we have all been living in a world defined by violence and fear since the invention of private property, it seems that something new is happening. The late Mike Davis diagnosed a “ruling class brain tumour” back in 2022 when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> He saw the ‘Special Military Operation’ as a characteristic sign of the “growing inability” in the ruling class “to achieve any coherent understanding of global change as a basis for defining common interests and formulating large-scale strategies.” Davis’s assessment therefore went beyond the opinions of the sociologists (Michael Mann, Immanuel Wallerstein, Giovanni Arrighi, etc.) who saw George W. Bush’s presidency as the ascendance of ill-advised militarist strategy correlated with the decadence of the American empire following the untimely demise of its Soviet nemesis. The cancer had apparently metastasized since 2008, no doubt partly because of the chaos wrought by the Global War on Terror, and bad strategy has given way to no strategy.</p> <p>What Davis’s brief article failed to mention—probably because he took it for granted—is the openly right-wing character of this cancerous, chaotic politics. It may lack strategic foresight, but it has been accompanied by ideological justification (and in some cases democratic approval) all the way. Bloodshed is seen as the only way out of the crisis of class civilization. The exhaustion of extensive socio-economic expansion in the face of climate apocalypse transfigures the <em>ver sacrum</em> to which capitalism has always devoted its youth into a neverending season in hell.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p> <h2 id="iv---to-serve-two-masters">IV - To Serve Two Masters</h2> <p>Satanist and nihilist terrorists are part of the same lineage and milieu as Christian ones. Catholicism and Orthodoxy are just as much a part of this culture of murder as Klan-style protestantism and appeals to cultural Christendom. The objective collusion between Opus Dei and the Order of Nine Angles is—to my knowledge, at least—not a premeditated conspiracy, although one might be shocked at how easily connections can be drawn. I want to emphasize that all these organizations, groups, and individuals are part of the same global social movement and, in a broad sense, the same tradition and culture. If, as the erstwhile Waffen-SS volunteer Armin Mohler argued, the European right could be described as a continental “conservative revolution” originally born in reaction to the French Revolution,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> the events of the twentieth century transformed this European current into a truly global one. Being a Nazi, a Satanist, a Christian, a pagan, an atheist, or, indeed, even a Jew, does not disqualify one for membership in this movement, which in past decades was more inclined to create formal international bodies like the World Anti-Communist League and New European Order.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p> <p>The culture of the right is a religion of death. This is the great and profound thesis of Furio Jesi.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> All reactionaries pray to the same god—death—but they employ different rites. Here is an example from a document circulated by the Ukrainian neo-nazi organization Misanthropic Division: “Misanthropic Division Chapters should struggle by all means necessary and whatever it takes to rebuild a common european society, based on Family, Folk and Tradition; protecting our European Culture and Identity.”<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> The Misanthropic Division’s defense of Family (note the capitalization) is clearly of a kind with that of Alternative für Deutschland, Reform (UK), the Republican Party, and so on. There is human sacrifice by means of terrorism and human sacrifice by means of legally sanctioned capital punishment (something that the parties of the European right desperately want to bring back), but at base they are the same thing. The nazi esotericism of O9A follows Francis Bacon in seeing knowledge (and all human activity) as a form of domination, only now afflicted by a mutation born from the definitive exhaustion of enlightenment in the 20th century. Through a chiasmic reversal, domination is posited as a form of knowledge before the violence of ‘order’ itself degenerates into stochastic atrocities.</p> <p>At the linguistic level, the right’s speech is empty and devoid of trust. Ideas without words, words without ideas, bad faith, and floating mythological signifiers abound. <em>Mein Kampf</em> is one product of this fundamental attunement with the false; ironic-but-not-really videos from the United States’ Department of Homeland Security glorifying the willful cruelty of its slipshod ethnic cleansing campaign by means of tongue-in-cheek references to pedophilic memes are another. (An expanded frame is therefore necessary to understand—dare I say, to <em>grok—</em>the real meanings and purposes beneath their utterances, purposes which sometimes operate behind their own backs, and the way these utterances work; this is Jesi’s idea of a “science of non-knowledge.”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>) Communication thus dies and is replaced by the voluptuous circulation of ideologemes (Jameson) or mythological materials (Jesi) on one hand and merely strategic use of language on the other.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> The affective world of the right is that of fear and shadow, sad passions and man’s baser instincts. It is a world where camaraderie only comes uneasily and on the basis of either hierarchy or a collective plan for revenge.</p> <p>Beneath the jargon and facades, however, the right confesses to another master besides the god of death: Mammon. Perhaps we could say, using the jargon of religious studies, that the culture of the right is henotheistic: there is one supreme god (death), but worship of other deities (Mammon) is permissible. Or is it a polytheistic religious ecosystem in which the Mammonites have their own temples separate from the Mortuators? Or maybe Mammon is like Brahman, the unseen and impersonal master god, and Death is like Kali as seen by the Shaktas, the active essence of Brahman in personal form? I jest, but the reality of conflicts on the right is sometimes inscrutable to us on the left. We try to argue that so-and-so politically represents this faction of capital and what’s-his-name represents the opposing one. Appealing to things like contingency, tactical flexibility, genuine disagreements, and interpersonal friction can seem like a cop out, but it’s the best answer. They fight for a variety of reasons, but they always seem to make up in the end. When exterminatory fascism is ascendant, capitalists fall in line and look for a way to make some money from the situation. When economically liberal forms of reaction reign, the fascists enjoy a role in their coalition whether formally or otherwise. Capitalism is the unsurpassable political horizon of reaction.</p> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ReactionPt2/">Read Part II</a></p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>In this I am attempting to follow Alberto Toscano’s lead; see his <em>Late Fascism</em> (Verso, 2023). <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>I am also limiting the scope to the United States for the most part and trying not to take events that happened after I started writing this into account because I would never be able to finish if I tried to keep pace with the news cycle. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, “Dangerous Organizations and Bad Actors: Feuerkrieg Division,” <em>Middlebury Institute of International Studies</em>, 07/19/2022. <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/ctec/ctec-publications/dangerous-organizations-and-bad-actors">https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/ctec/ctec-publications/dangerous-organizations-and-bad-actors</a>; Alex Newhouse, “The Threat Is the Network: The Multi-Node Structure of Neo-Fascist Accelerationism,” <em>CTC Sentinel</em>, vol. 14, no. 5 (June 2021), 17-25. <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-threat-is-the-network-the-multi-node-structure-of-neo-fascist-accelerationism/">https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-threat-is-the-network-the-multi-node-structure-of-neo-fascist-accelerationism/</a> <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>Chris Schiano and Unicorn Riot, “LEAKED: Neo-Nazi Terrorist ‘Feuerkrieg Division’ Organizing Chats,” <em>Unicorn Riot</em>, 03/20/2020. <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2020/leaked-neo-nazi-terrorist-feuerkreig-division-organizing-chats/">https://unicornriot.ninja/2020/leaked-neo-nazi-terrorist-feuerkreig-division-organizing-chats/</a> <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:5"> <p><em>United States of America v.

I argue that Horkheimer’s contribution to racket theory provides a stronger theorization that is less vulnerable to the critique of monopoly capital theory by Milios and Sotiropoulos that Mac invokes. Rather than viewing monopolies as displacing competition, Horkheimer sees monopolies as operating within, mediating, and intensifying competition. By both maintaining and downplaying the importance of competition, Horkheimer appears contradictory here, but I claim that what emerges from this tension is an expanded concept of competition rather than a story about its elimination.</p> <p>Before dealing with Horkheimer’s contributions to racket theory on the topic of the transformation of competition, I want to provide some background on the developments in economic theory that Horkheimer is responding to. I claim that by attacking Baran and Sweezy’s predecessors, Horkheimer’s writings here contain a preemptive critique of the Monthly Review School, for whom starting with the absence of competition is necessary for an analysis of contemporary capitalism based in reality.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Because the theorists of the MR School recognize this as the only possible way forward for economic theory, we find Bellamy Foster asserting the following: “the choice is a stark one: between dealing seriously with the problem of monopoly as a growing factor in the modern economy and thus undermining neoclassical theory, or denying the essential reality of monopoly and therefore preserving the theory.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Of course, dealing with the problem of monopoly means accepting that capital has managed to stabilize itself by banning competition between capitals.</p> <p>Horkheimer denies the existence of neither monopoly nor competition. Instead, Horkheimer understands racketization as a process of expansion of the economic and continuous integration of subjects into the realm of competition accompanied by an expanded set of methods used in the struggle to capture surplus value such that the distinction between the economic and the extra-economic vanishes. To the extent that Horkheimer is a theorist of the decline of competition, this is the decline of the bourgeois concept of competition and the decline of the restriction of capitalist competition to the economic. And unlike in the Monthly Review School, Horkheimer’s theory does not demand a fundamental revision of Marx’s analysis of capitalism because Marx is read as an early critic of the bourgeois concept of competition.</p> <p>Horkheimer’s theory of monopolization in “On the Sociology of Class Relations” is premised on the falsity of free competition. Far from reproducing the myth of the decline of competition, Horkheimer warns against overstating the differences between the present and earlier periods, complaining that economists now rely too heavily on non-economic factors to explain the current state of things. Here, he seems to be responding to the shift in thinking about competition in the ‘30s and ‘40s within economics, the devolution from a simple account of the absence of feudal institutions in Adam Smith to a rigid model of perfectly knowledgeable and rational agents in marginalism and finally to a fixation on institutional and cultural factors in imperfect competition theory.</p> <p>The standard theory of competition in economic theory today is captured by what John Weeks termed the ‘quantity theory of competition,’ describing the tendency to associate competition and monopoly such that they are opposed poles on a spectrum, wherein monopoly is defined as a market with one firm and competition as a market with infinite firms.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> In this view, a decrease in the number and an increase in the size of firms within a market directly produces a decrease in the intensity of competition. The centralization of capital then becomes synonymous with a decline in overall competition, and subsequently firm competitiveness. It is accepted that competition generates optimal economic outcomes: increasing productivity, declining prices, and rising wages. These tendencies are thought to be dependent on the operation of competition, built on the assumption that firm behavior is determined by the degree of market concentration. As such, a rise in market concentration is seen to produce the inverse: stagnation, inflation, and inequality.</p> <p>The understanding of competition as the antithesis of monopoly has its roots in classical political economy, especially in the work of Smith. But there is no systematic theory of competition and its relationship to monopoly until Cournot, and his theory was not particularly influential until it was rediscovered by the marginalists. Smith’s understanding of competition was one formed within the relatively small sphere of economic activity in eighteenth-century England, where trade was still conducted by independent artisans, merchants, and small-scale manufacturers.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> The monopolies he criticized—guilds, chartered companies, exclusive trading rights, and land privileges—were upheld by legal protections rather than purely economic forces. Rather than offering a theory of monopolistic behavior within a mature capitalist system, Smith was concerned with analyzing the barriers to capitalism’s expansion, examining the way in which it struggled against older forms of economic organization.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> As such, Smith’s theory of competition was largely negative, defined simply as not feudalism.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p> <p>With the marginalist revolution, the understanding of competition changed, redefined as a static market condition characterized by a lack of any monopoly power.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Smith’s description of an immature capitalism is taken by neoclassical thinkers to be the ideal market condition.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> The competitive market becomes a perfect state wherein prices are determined entirely through supply and demand interactions, with each individual agent acting as a price-taker.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Competition tends to be narrowly understood as price competition, with price-setting behavior taken as evidence of a lack of competition, typically due to the presence of barriers to the entry of new firms.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> The term ‘marginalist’ comes from the notion that in the ideal market, a marginal change leaves an individual actor no better off.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> In this formulation, then, any price-setting activity by firms is seen as evidence of a decline in competition.</p> <p>Soon after the theory of perfect competition was introduced, it fell into crisis. Confronted with the reality that their science of autonomous and automatic market forces was incapable of grasping the reality of contemporary capitalism, and it thus became undeniable that firms were not mere price-takers, economists were compelled to refine their theory. None of the assumptions of what defined a competitive market—perfect knowledge, utility maximizing behavior by consumers and firms, perfect mobility of labor and capital, and a sufficiently large number of firms to justify the theory of price-taking—could be located in any real market.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> But rather than question these foundations, economists concluded that capitalism had simply become less competitive, as the neoclassical concept of competition was too closely bound with the actual process of competition.</p> <p>While the marginalist revolution transformed Smith’s analysis of the decline of feudal institutions into an abstract model of infinitely many competing firms, the Keynesian revolution reconfigured the neoclassical theory of perfect competition into a theory of imperfect competition by piling on complexities. Influential economists like Sraffa, Chamberlin, Robinson, and Sweezy developed the concept of ‘imperfect competition’ in the ‘30s to capture the state between perfect competition and pure monopoly by beginning with the assumption of monopoly rather than competition.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> In imperfect competition theory, monopoly is foregrounded alongside factors such as asymmetric information, uncertainty, barriers to entry and exit, and state power in the quest to produce a more empirically true theory of competition.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> But in the Austrian backlash to imperfect competition theory, the ‘perfectionists’ were easily able to integrate the factors laid out by the ‘imperfectionists,’ particularly asymmetric information and fundamental uncertainty, which were later deployed to critique socialism. The doctrine of perfect competition came out stronger after the heterodox intervention.</p> <p>Moreover, recalling Mill’s assertion that “only through the principle of competition has political economy any pretension to the character of a science,”<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> the assumption of the decline of competition and the endless inclusion of complexities into the theory of imperfect competition actively undermines the possibility of actually theorizing capitalism. It tends to be accepted that there are simply too many factors within price competition to produce any sort of general theory, leading to a turn to econometrics to escape the incoherencies at the core of microeconomics.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> Economists today constantly refer to institutional, historical, and cultural particularities to excuse their inability to analyze economic phenomena: “But just as ‘national economy’ once veiled economic reality by hypostasizing market processes, now the increase of concentration on politics—or, at best, on technology—effectively prevents cognition of the facts of the matter.”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p> <p>Bourgeois economists are incapable of confronting the falsity of their understanding of competition: For the bourgeoisie, the fall of serfdom and mercantilism seemed to have abolished class distinctions, producing what they understand as the natural order of competition among free individuals. This order is supposed to be the correct way for human society to be organized, the realization of our innate propensity to truck and barter. In this vision of bourgeois society, every subject is both producer and consumer; there is no class. Anything that disrupts this picture is an intrusion of the non-economic into the sphere of the economic. To the extent that they are willing to acknowledge it, monopolization compels the bourgeoisie to admit that the unequal distribution of power continues to exist under their rule. Rather than accepting the falsity of their understanding of competition, however, the bourgeoisie understands monopolization solely as a regression to a prior mode of direct class rule. They admit that competition, as they understand it, no longer exists, but they believe that it once did, and that what exists today is no longer genuine competition.</p> <p>Against this, Horkheimer understands pre-monopoly capitalism as characterized both by competition that reached all members of the population and by the unresolved problem of power. Whether by “birth or deceit, brutality or shrewdness, expertness in engineering machinery or human relations, by marriage or adulation,”<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> there have always been groups that have managed the competitive processes within capitalism. Racketization is a reversion to more direct forms of domination, but these forms were always present, hidden behind the apparently rational market system, and this “was already clear to everyone except for the professors in the times of so-called liberalism.”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p> <p>The structure of every ruling class consists of competing rackets. This was more evident in earlier modes of production, visible in the struggles between the church and the nobility or the urban and rural gentries. In these forms of competition, laymen and commoners play no significant role and are excluded from the game. What seems to be the most dramatic change within contemporary capitalism, then, is the way in which the ruled are forced to racketize and enter competition alongside the ruling.</p> <p>Here, the conflict between the different concepts of competition that Horkheimer is working with is most obvious. There is the strictly economic concept of competition, which can be divided into its imagined form as free competition and its actual form as intra-class competition. The latter consists of two distinct spheres of competition, one among workers and another among capitalists, neither of which are captured by the bourgeois notion of competition as the universal struggle of all against all. These spheres are defined by a struggle over wages by workers and over the distribution of surplus value by capitalists. With the development of the racketized workers’ movement, organized labor enters into the capitalists’ intra-class competition, producing a state wherein “[the working class’s] relationships to the different capitalistic groups are no longer radically different from those prevailing among the capitalistic groups themselves.”<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> The result of this integration—a unified, single sphere of competition—ironically resembles the bourgeois notion of competition more closely than the competition of early capitalism did (thus Horkheimer: “The regression, however, is not the repetition but the distortion of the original state of affairs.”<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>)</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>Throughout “On the Sociology of Class Relations,” Horkheimer appears to deliberately maintain two contradictory theses: first, that competition has undermined itself and been replaced by monopoly; and second, that the bourgeois concept of competition was invalid from the start and was always undermined by the existence of monopoly. It is this tension between what is a break with early bourgeois society and what is essential to all class societies that makes Horkheimer’s understanding of the racket distinct from other Marxist theories of the monopoly. I argue that what emerges from this tension, both materially and theoretically, is not the elimination of competition but rather an expansion of competition through the integration of the working class. Racketization is the movement from purely economic competition, wherein workers and capitalists are placed within distinct spheres of competition, to total competition: the competition between rackets. The reach and intensity of competition are greater than before, but strictly formal competition is just one among several methods, alongside robbery and swindling, employed in the “never ending fight over booty.”<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> This is the true universal struggle of all against all, fought not by individuals but by their rackets. While not present in Horkheimer’s analysis, we can say today that financialization plays a crucial role here by transforming workers into small investors, thereby further binding their reproduction to the fluctuations of the stock market.</p> <p>Regarding the implications of racket theory’s understanding of competition for Marx’s analysis of capital, it is first necessary to recall the role that competition plays in Marx’s system and challenge the pervasive belief that the labor theory of value holds only under conditions of perfect competition.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> The interpretation of Marx fails because it erroneously assumes that competition has the same status for him as it does for neoclassical theorists. Marx’s theory does not rely on the conditions of perfect competition; rather, he assumes the existence of multiple competing firms that set their own prices, though not wholly under conditions of their choosing, since they face competition both within and outside their sectors.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> While changes in competition may affect distribution and widen the gap between particular values and their prices, this is a flaw internal to capital rather than a flaw in its theorization.</p> <p>Marx does not begin with the concept of competition and does not ascribe it the same duties as bourgeois economists do; this has resulted in much confusion from monopoly capital theorists who wish to explain stagnation through declining competition. In bourgeois economics, competition is foregrounded such that it is thought to be responsible for all economic phenomena.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> Marx is explicitly hostile to this theorizing of competition: “Competition executes the inner laws of capital; makes them into compulsory laws towards the individual capital, but it does not invent them. It realizes them.”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> As such, the concept of competition is largely absent in the first two volumes of <em>Capital</em> and is only introduced after the inner laws of capital are analyzed.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> Bourgeois economics grounds its theory of profit in circulation, whereas Marx locates it in production.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> Competition punishes less efficient capitals and establishes a uniform rate of profit, but it itself is not the source of growth. Total profits result from total social capital and competition mediates their distribution.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> As such, locating stagnation in changes to competition, as monopoly capital theorists tend to do, depends on the adoption of a non-Marxian theory of surplus. The confusion is due to the fact that individual firms often achieve profit through circulation and distribution, but total profit is only the result of exploitation within production.</p> <p>Within distribution, while monopolization may allow large capitals to insulate themselves from competitive pressures, enabling them to escape price competition, the centralization of capital can also facilitate the equalization of profit rates. Unlike a Smithian monopoly, which maintains its position typically due to privileges granted by states, Marxian monopolies hold because of the competitiveness of the firms involved. Monopolists tend to maintain their market share because they retain their high levels of productivity, and in their effort to constrain competition, monopolists are forced to behave competitively to prevent new entrants.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> Far from being solely parasitic, the investment of trusts, cartels, and especially financial rackets in multiple sectors, and their ability to quickly enter new sectors, provides them with the ability to rapidly move capital from low-profit to high-profit areas, aiding the equalization of profit rates while expanding the gap between those who are able to compete effectively and those who cannot.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> This capacity only increases under globalization.</p> <p>I do not believe that Horkheimer contests any of this. What racketization has produced is not a fundamental change in the nature of competition nor a decline in its prevalence, but rather a lifting of the veil of free competition to reveal the continued existence of direct rule in daily life, a continuous expansion of the realm of competition through the inclusion of non-capitalist participants, and a declining commitment to the old rules of competition, marked by the growing set of methods employed in the struggle to capture value.</p> <p>This is perhaps the most prescient aspect of Horkheimer’s theory of racketization. Whether through fake job listings, crypto scams, phishing texts, or other schemes made possible by our dependence on the internet, swindling has become an increasingly common method for the capture of surplus value, especially amid an ever-growing reserve army of labor. What this contributes to is the state of general resentment in the “unsuccessful competitors” and “vanquished opponents,”<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> with the mass shooting as its primary expression. This is the logical endpoint of total competition: the elimination of as many competitors as possible in the “chaotic war of all against all.”<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Friedrich A. von Hayek, <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> (Routledge, 2006), 205. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>Mac Parker, “The Economic Limits of Racketology,” CTWG, 2025, <a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Limits_of_Rackets/">https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Limits_of_Rackets/</a>. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Anwar Shaikh, <em>Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crises</em> (Oxford University Press), 329. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>John Bellamy Foster, <em>The Theory of Monopoly Capitalism: An Elaboration of Marxian Political Economy</em> (Monthly Review Press, 2014), 52. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:5"> <p>John Weeks, <em>Capital and Exploitation</em> (Princeton University Press, 1982), 153. <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:6"> <p>Brett Christophers, <em>The Great Leveler: Capitalism and Competition in the Court of Law</em> (Harvard University Press, 2016), 31. <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:7"> <p>James A.

Adorno,” recorded during the first two weeks of October 1946, about the planned sequel to <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>. These <em>Diskussionsprotokolle</em> were first published posthumously in Volume 12 of Horkheimer’s <em>Gesammelte Schriften</em> under the title: “Rettung der Aufklärung. Diskussionen über eine geplante Schrift zur Dialektik.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> In addition to these discussions, the last two fragments under the same subheading were also selected for publication in the same volume of Horkheimer’s <em>GS</em>: “Towards a Critique of the American Social Sciences” and “The Fate of Revolutionary Movements,” each of which is also dated “October 1946.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> One possible motive for the omission of the fragments below from Horkheimer’s <em>GS</em> is difficulty in determining authorship. Despite a number of indications to the contrary in the text of the fragments themselves, the archivists (tentatively) attribute them to Adorno alone—a problematic approach the archivists seem to have adopted for several other unpublished fragments from the archive with indeterminate authorship as well.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> In terms of content, there are two grounds for rejecting this attribution.</p> <p><em>First</em>, each of the fragments translated below—“On The Relation Between Critical Intellectuals, the Proletariat, and the Communist Party” and “The Curse of Writing Today”—is written in the first-person plural voice (“we,” “our,” “us,” etc.), and it is this voice that claims joint authorship of ‘Dialectic of Enlightenment’ in “The Curse of Writing Today”: “The process of demythologization, as we have described it in the ‘Dialectic of Enlightenment,’ should be developed [further] on the basis of the concept of labor.” (In the fall of 1946, “Dialectic of Enlightenment” was only the title of the first chapter of the book, but not the book itself, which was still titled <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em>. The first chapter would only be retitled “Concept of Enlightenment,” and the book as a whole <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, later in the process of revising the manuscript for publication in late 1947.)<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Further, the same fragment refers in jest to a hypothetical endorsement of incest written by “H” and “A”: “Today, if we were to criticize psychoanalysis and exhort to incest, Herr Schapiro would say to Herr Kohn: <em>Have you read H and A’s rather interesting criticism yet?</em>” The other fragment, “On the Relation of Critical Intellectuals to the Proletariat and the Communist Party,” is likewise written in the first-person plural throughout.</p> <p><em>Second</em>, the fragments seem to refer to debates Horkheimer and Adorno were having with their collaborators about the correct relationship between critical intellectuals and the communist party—in particular, Horkheimer’s dispute with Paul Massing and Leo Löwenthal. As evident from Horkheimer’s correspondence with Löwenthal between July through October 1946, Löwenthal and Massing tried (in vain) to convince Horkheimer and Adorno to include stronger criticisms of the USSR and tone down criticisms of the ‘liberal democracies’ as the group finalized the draft for Thesis VII of “Elements of Anti-Semitism.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Given that Löwenthal expresses his consternation in said correspondence that “Mr. Eisler”—referring to Hans Eisler, partisan of the official communist movement and collaborator of Adorno’s—“did not explode” upon reading the drafts of Thesis VII., it is reasonable to assume that the remark in “On The Relation Between Critical Intellectuals, the Proletariat, and the Communist Party” which explicitly names Eisler and Massing as representatives of the dichotomous positions towards the existing communist party criticized in the fragment (“… we would emulate neither Eisler nor Massing”) is a direct reference to Horkheimer and Adorno’s ongoing dispute with Löwenthal and Massing in the fall of 1946.</p> <p>In sum, both grounds for objecting to the attribution of these fragments to Adorno alone double as reasons for interpreting them as intrinsically bound up with the development of ‘Critical Theory’ through 1946, and arguably through the late 1940s as a whole.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> The unapologetic profession of a revolutionary communism in defiance of Stalin’s USSR and refusal of the reformist postwar settlement in the liberal-democratic states, the quasi-third-worldist redeployment of the concept of ‘proletarian nations’ against Hitlerian white supremacy, and the projected development the ‘dialectic of enlightenment’ through the medium of ‘<a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro/">racket theory</a>’ into a negative outline of a new internationalism—none of this can be divorced from Horkheimer and Adorno’s <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> without betraying the spirit of the radical, heterodox Marxism that still animates it, however subterraneanly.</p> <h2 id="on-the-relation-between-critical-intellectuals-the-proletariat-and-the-communist-party">On The Relation Between Critical Intellectuals, the Proletariat, and the Communist Party</h2> <p>Intellectuals, especially the more sociologically informed, are fundamentally convinced that ‘revolution’ has outlived itself. Even mention of its possibility sounds naive. Any hope for armed uprising falls silent not only when forced to confront the backwardness of the barricades before advances in modern weapons technology, but also in view of the more humane development of social reforms in England and even America. Whenever ‘revolution’ is spoken of, neither friend nor foe bother to distinguish between communism and the Russian fatherland any longer. ‘Marxism’ is Stalin’s policy; the revolt of the working class, the invasion of the Red Army. By such thinking, the fear that there could be anything other than that which exists, that there might be something more at which historical action should be aimed, is appeased; for the strife between nations and power-blocs takes place entirely within the framework of established society instead. No matter the outcome, the already powerful grow more powerful still; weaker competitors lose, just as they always have. What politics ought to abolish becomes politics par excellence. Thus, the mechanism meant to absorb the total energies of society has today become superfluous. When the life-process of society was still opaque to most of its members, politics, as a split-off, specialized sphere of social behavior, still had a semblance of substantiality; its irrationality, an index of the alleged <em>ratio</em> of those at the wheel. Today, the technical and human forces of production have been developed to such a great extent that really everyone already knows <em>how it functions, what it’s all about, what’s possible, what the goal really is,</em> only it is precisely this knowledge which is not conscious.</p> <p>‘Spirit’ as designation for a sector of the division of labor is indeed a reified function; on the other hand, one cannot simply leap over the division of labor, especially not like the Russians do. They believe that by plugging it directly into the business of politics and administration, participation in factory assemblies, etc., its isolation can be abolished. But this is untrue, because it snuffs out the last spark of autonomy that still glimmered in that sector by handing it over to the worst of all specialistdom—namely, the administrator. For Marx, spirit, as a moment of the revolutionary movement which was supposed to break through reified society, possessed the substantiality of the non-reified human being.</p> <p>Our difficulty is double: we do not want to become mere “third persons” again.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> This doesn’t mean we have anything against the “parasitic.” On the contrary—freedom from the compulsion of production in decadent bourgeois society went hand-in-hand with the survival of autonomy. However, after Marx, one can no longer seek to entertain the bourgeoisie in the role of the “third person,” be it through critique or glorification. We must maintain our clarity on this point, though we know full well that our spiritual-intellectual occupation is really still just the natural mode of existence for the sons of rich parents. Were we “existential philosophers,” this is how we would reflect on our “existence.”</p> <p>The other difficulty relates to the concept of practice, as opposite fetishized spirit. This stems from the state of the worker’s movement. We do not believe anyone should be forced to join the ranks of those who accept the alternative of being “for” or “against” the communist party; we would emulate neither Eisler nor Massing. To accept this alternative without reservation would itself entail the recognition that the revolution has ended in failure. To the contrary, we believe that this very dichotomy, and above all the communist party itself, belongs to that world which is to be overcome through the revolution. If it is true that technology is revolutionizing the entire world, readying it for the creation of a human society, then the Russians, and above all their leaders, are objectively complicit in arresting this development. Despite their forward-driving role in Asia, they reinforce the forgetting of the society that would, today, correspond to the level of development of the forces of production on a global scale. Therefore however reluctant we are to, we must aim a critique at the international organizations as the poor, overextended rackets they are—as the caricature of what could be. Even now they evince only the shared interests of the bureaucracies of various national rackets. The opposition between Russia and America has in both countries largely had the function of an excuse to the masses for reducing the returns of their labor by invoking the menace of the opposing power-bloc.</p> <p>As far as the right state of humanity—already possible today—is concerned, Marx essentially defined it through the concept of leisure. We must build on this concept, which, incidentally, is deeply connected with that of the “third person.” However, we must also be careful not to follow Marx in endorsing the historical process as a whole simply because it leads to harmony through revolution, for instance. Humanity cannot realize paradise with bloody hands.</p> <p>The structure of the concept of dehumanization has changed. For Marx, it signified non-participation in culture, brutalization; today, it proceeds through the complete conquest of culture, an ironic fulfillment of Hegel’s idea of the identity between what man is for-himself and his social substance. This development affects the concept of leisure. Labor-time has, in fact, already been reduced under monopoly capitalism through the complete dematerialization of labor. But this disqualification of labor has fallen victim to what, in Marx’s conception, was supposed to make humans human in their leisure. The individual that, according to Hegel, can only realize itself in universal social determinations has so completely realized itself through them that there’s nothing that could really be considered individual about them anymore (Bloom, Flowerman). This involves, however, the dialectic whereby the individual, having realized its substance in the Hegelian sense, loses any substance it had at the same time: to the individual, the choice of their vocation, such as being chief of police, is as “external” to them in the Hegelian sense as the question of whether they prefer roast veal or roast mutton. The less they need to work, the more they become a mere appendage of the machine in their leisure.</p> <p>In a certain sense, politics is no longer relevant, since <em>what it’s all about</em>, <em>what the goal of politics really is</em> has become clear to just about everyone. What the American workers ought to do is so clear that no movement is required for this purpose anymore. The communist party is so powerless precisely because it’s no longer connected to any truly attainable revolutionary goal whatsoever[; just] blind adherence to an array of irrational elements, e.g., leadership, wage-differentiation, the cult of production-as-such, the hypostasizing of ‘the nation’ and ‘the people,’ the fetishizing of concepts like organization and discipline[, the] type of the organizer. But despite everything, all the decent people still caught in the party—the stalwarts, if they’re not intellectuals or evil—are mostly good. [The party still has a] progressive, world-political function, especially in Asia and the European territories they’ve seized. The pressure that stems from the fact that today human beings work for cliques afraid of being overthrown the whole world over—this pressure must be abolished. Just as corporate trusts don’t want their salaried employees to act on their own initiative spontaneously and beyond their assigned stations, the communist worker ought to stick to their assigned functions in party-work and, for God’s sake, not worry about the big picture. In our <em>Manifesto</em> we must do justice to the people in the party, but as revolutionaries;<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> not in the manner of bourgeois critique, which always defends the misled masses from the ones pulling the strings [<em>Drahtzieher</em>]; quite the contrary, the leadership holds the strings still. One can only be totally opposed to what’s happened if one says it always had to happen this way.</p> <p>To view the communist revolution as the promenade of the red army through the Western countries still has at least the aura of high treason for the proletarian masses of Europe and Asia; for the oppressed Russian people, such a conception is nothing but <em>Kadavergehorsam</em>.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> The communist parties outside [Russia] are fifth columns and, of course, immediately remind every revolutionary impulse within Russia that it must be unpatriotic. In turn, this rebounds on western communism, which, through the concept of such narrow-minded patriotism, shares an understanding with the reactionaries of each respective country and simply writes a different name into the same schema of categories. This schematism is part of the transformation of communism into a system of delusion [<em>Wahnsystem</em>]. The phenomenon is not primarily psychological, but objective in origin, arising from the separation of communism from theory and its pragmatic identification with Russia. Power becomes panacea, and connection to it cuts off consciousness and leads to blindness instead of a dialectical process in thinking and practice. The paranoid features of its followers correspond to the fascistization of the party.</p> <p>The content of this section should be determining the political action which, in our view, would today be the first step towards the realization of the right order and which only remains undone due to the stupefaction of human beings. This action would have to consist in the American workers calling on their counterparts in Russia, the only power in the world of equal rank, to send their own leaders, the whole repressive baggage of administration, straight to hell. Then, the Americans should say, they’ll ensure that all production for the sake of waging war is brought to a halt. Motive for this action: provision for the earth [as a whole] is hindered by the fact that in the decisive countries, countless working hours are spent in part on means of destruction, in part on means of stupefaction. The latter includes the swindle of technical differentiation (De Soto vs. Plymouth, and the social competition this promotes), and, of course, pseudo-production [<em>Scheinproduktion</em>] such as advertising. More and more working hours are therefore squandered while innumerable labor-saving inventions are left unused because of capitalist and trade-unionist interests, not to mention the forces which lie fallow in unemployment. Only once this nonsense, which the rulers on both sides employ to instill the reason of that which exists into the masses by fear, has been dispelled can the masses of these countries who’ve been duped by it up to now really begin to help the rest of the world. It will then become evident that no necessary opposition exists between this “rest” who are kept immiserated despite the potential ‘wealth of nations’ and the workers who profit from this very misery without clear consciousness of doing so. Humanity is ripe for socialism.</p> <p>To prove this, the American workers must of course get serious. A gesture such as the one described above assumes they are willing, after fundamentally changing the relations in their own country, to wage war on Russia should it resist. That American workers believe the most advanced country on earth could carry out a revolution without at the same time assuming responsibility for the earth as a whole is almost as narrow-minded as the idea of “socialism in one country,” or [the idea] that the revolution consists solely in preventing American monopolists—who are in fact drooling at the thought of making common cause with Stalin—from waging war against Russia.</p> <p>The objection that American workers are only getting better and better off, that they have no materialistic reason for revolution, does not stand up to scrutiny. The most revolutionary strata of the European working class were often the higher-paid, and therefore more advanced and in a position to lead the rest of the class. It is a product of the apparatus of stupefaction [<em>Verdummungsapparats</em>] that so many believe the pressure, oppression, and danger brought down on the proletariat is any lesser today than it was in the nineteenth century. It is true that corruption has greater social impact through the creation of distinctions internal to the proletariat, such as that between the skilled mechanical workers in the North and the unskilled Negroes in the South. The distinctions are cruder and the corrupted, a majority; but the value of the acquisition, the hygienic life of the modern worker, is extremely dubious. Their difference from the authorities in their own camp, the union bosses and monopolists, is immeasurably great; the suffering of the most downtrodden strata of the oppressed in their own country, and even more so that of the world as a whole, infinitely great; and the threat of total war, gigantic. In view of the transposition of the class struggle onto the international stage (to be dealt with in another part of the text),<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> the “better and better” situated the American working class happens to be, the better the vanguard for the oppressed of all countries.</p> <p>Hitler’s concept of the “proletarian nation” ought to be taken up, but its point must be turned back upon itself. It correctly describes the tendency of class struggle to transpose itself into conflicts on the international level. For Hitler, however, this concept only plays the role of an ideology because, on the one hand, it helped cover-up class antagonisms in his own country, and on the other, Hitler pretended as if by speaking for the German proletarian nation he had taken the side of the weaker, when in actuality it was precisely that of the stronger—and for the sake of exhorting Germany to become the strong arm for the supremacy of the white race. Anti-Semitism, along with the entirety of race-theory, is probably to be understood in the sense of such a conception. Lust for the eradication of the Jews exhibits the unconscious fear of losing their dominion to the colored peoples of the world. In opposition to Hitler then, one must take the concept of the proletarian nation seriously; for him, this concept has exactly the same function the word “socialism” does in the name of his party on the domestic front.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p> <p>That the proletarians of the industrialized countries feel themselves the vanguard of the colored peoples of the world does not mean they are under any illusions about the possible imperialism of the latter, as exemplified in the case of the Japanese. Emancipation in colonial areas, from Argentina to Pakistan, is being carried out in semi-fascistic forms and is thoroughly anti-Semitic. However, imperialism need not become reality if the proletarians really make their revolution. The step we have described could truly transform the world. It would eliminate the very grounds of such imperialism. With the Western and Russian workers united, not even the Malays would need to replay the game of the ascendant bourgeoisie. Just as little would the backwards strata of the workers in more advanced countries be forced to act out their backwards ideologies after the revolution. Once the vanguard, national or international, has taken such a step (precisely what Lenin originally meant by the ‘dictatorship’), then humanity will be grasped at its very core: that is the meaning of Marx’s theory.</p> <h2 id="the-curse-of-writing-today">The Curse of Writing Today</h2> <p>The curse of writing today consists in the fact that no matter how it turns out, it never gets a rise out of anyone anymore. The <em>Communist Manifesto</em> really set something else into motion. It presupposes a non-integrated society: the proletariat is not yet completely “inside,” and insofar as it has no part in “humanity” proper, it is all the better for it, even in its so-called dehumanization. Today, if we were to criticize psychoanalysis and exhort the reader to incest, Herr Schapiro would say to Herr Kohn: <em>have you read H and A’s rather interesting criticism yet?</em> We believe that the relationship between what is written and the world must, as it is co-decisive for the truth of the thing, be consciously incorporated into its theoretical formulation. However, it’s precisely this relationship that’s become questionable for us.</p> <p>The sole path we see before us on which we won’t fall behind Marx is one that takes his categories as a point of departure. Here, we’re thinking of concepts like class and labor. As for class, we have a critique in mind, the object of which is the dissolution of class into rackets. Perhaps there has never been a ‘class’ in the strict sense. The process of demythologization, as we have described it in the “Dialectic of Enlightenment,” should be further developed vis-a-vis the concept of labor. Enlightenment means the detachment of labor from its material. Today, this process is essentially mediated through trade unions. They separate the laborer more and more from his objective interests. The task is to uncover the dialectic of this process, and thus of the labor movement and the concept of the proletariat.</p> <p>We cannot be certain whether the adoption of Marxian categories guarantees any timeliness to our theoretical activity today. For starters, however, it seems to us as if an attack on the repressive role of the rackets (religious, political, military, industrial, trade unionist), which fight with one another on the surface but in truth agree with one another, could drive the movement further. In this regard, it is above all important to keep in mind that while the attack must be aimed at national rackets, the transposition of class relations onto the international stage must be taken into consideration where content is concerned. In the era of the transfer of [intra-]national class relations onto the oppression of entire peoples [<em>Völker</em>] by other peoples, the leaders of peoples join forces with all the gangsters of the world under the star of celebrity into a kind of international union. One such exponent of this union is Harold Laski.</p> <p>The encroaching integration of society makes the concept of non-conformism itself problematic in the sense that no theoretical nor even practical expression can be imagined that is not already ensnared in one form or another in the meshes of the system. One must accordingly develop forms of resistance different from those which presuppose some kind of transcendence to society, as with those of Marx’s time when the poor still had to be pressed into factories. Rather, the task today is to raise to consciousness those tendencies maturing even now within the integral society itself towards its overturning, and indeed to help them to the point they overturn it. The process of the radical alienation of labor, the domination of nature taken to its extreme, signifies the radical self-alienation of the human being, and thereby the absolutely negative—at the same time so “nearly utopia.” The fully reified society is infinitely close to the concept of humanity. The ant colony is a projection of those who prepare it, but repress it from their consciousness. Its conscious induction could coincide with its abolition.</p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>“Zum Verhältnis der kritischen Intellektuellen zu Proletariat und kommunistischer Partei” and “Der Fluch des Schreibens.” MHA Na 1 <a href="https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/horkheimer/content/titleinfo/6608138">806</a>, 107-118. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>Max Horkheimer and Theodor W.

Many of them have already been thought and written down by others: We are repeating them here because we find them relevant to our present concern. Those interested in our inspirations can consult the list at the end.</p> <p>While we did not feel the need to use the word ‘racket’ in all of these fragments, they nonetheless lie in the broader orbit of ‘racket theory.’ At some points we have opted for nuance, at others for a certain degree of tactical exaggeration. In discussing such a broad array of topics, we are assaying the utility of the concept of the racket as a theoretical northstar.</p> <h2 id="ça-nira-pas"><em>Ça n’ira pas</em></h2> <p>We would like to be clear about who we are not. We identify as our enemies the Zionist, chauvinist, and self-proclaimed “anti-fascist” distorters of critical theory. Certain scholars, many of them German and Austrian, have taken it upon themselves to draft the critical theory of Adorno, Horkheimer, and the rest into their defenses of the genocidal project of Zionism. Today we are not surprised when, upon consulting a text allegedly concerned with <em>kritische Theorie</em>, we find mad rants about the threat of <em>Islamo-Faschismus</em>.</p> <p>Ever the defenders of bourgeois barbarism, these charlatans construct an absolute barrier between the <em>djihadistische</em>, <em>islamistische</em> rackets and the holy European Rule of Law. The presence of exceptional executive powers in the Islamic Republic of Iran becomes justification for the use of the exceptional military powers of NATO against its population. State failure born from colonialism and imperialism becomes justification for interventions guaranteed to re-entrench it. Sectarian violence in Syria is solved by indiscriminate bombing.</p> <p>Even among those who are smart enough not to explicitly lend their support to imperialist genocide, the “anti-nationalist” reflex, admirably developed against European nationalist chauvinism by Marxists during the first World War, becomes in a horrific reversal a mask for Western chauvinism—an alibi for ignoring the real dominations on the basis of race, nation, ethnicity, gender, sexuality… and counter-movements which necessarily must begin on those terms. “Of course,” they protest, “I do not approve of the present actions of the IDF and Netanyahu’s government, but—” But what! The supposed “critics” who flatten these quite real mediations in a slogan of “no war but the class war” have taken up a political stance monstrously retrograde even in comparison with the “black and white, unite and fight” mentality of Earl Browder’s CPUSA at the moment of its capitulation to capitalism. Their activity is more reminiscent of the PCF’s active participation in the colonial administration of Algeria, albeit thankfully confined to the realm of online posts, moronic pamphlets, academic bickering, and subcultural activity.</p> <p>If we refuse to remain blind to Zionist violence as Zionist violence, how then should we approach it? For a long time the Zionist movement (and eventually the State of Israel) was organized around the trifecta of the apartheid Zionist labor racket, which violently excluded Palestinians and other Arabs; the settlements and kibbutzim, which exploited and dispossessed Palestinians; and the Haganah-cum-IDF, which murdered them. Then came the era of the internal ethnic and sectarian rackets, a development correlated with the decline of the Labor Zionist racket and growth of the explicitly fascist streak in Israeli politics. The various occupational strategies for turning Palestine into a Bantustan—the collaborationism of Fatah in the West Bank, arming of Yasser abu Shabab’s bandits in Gaza, attempts to recruit the elites of clans and Bedouin tribes, the Oslo Accords—are racket-like in character. The strategies of genocide, meanwhile, dispense with the pretense of exploitation entirely.</p> <p>Our opponents fail to understand that the perversion of the concept of the racket for dull critiques of <em>Djihadismus</em>—an orientalist discursive construct that has relatively little in common with actual Salafi jihadism (an incredibly marginal political tendency in Palestine)—discredits in advance any attempt to understand the real human tragedy of reactionary Islamism through the lens of critical theory. It is easier to say that a man takes up the gun because of his religion, his greed, or his hatred of Jews than to argue he does it because he is <em>rimaybé</em>, marked from birth as a descendent of slaves and desperate for a life worth living. The petty-bourgeois background of many of the most infamous jihadis suggests an analogy with fascism, but it also suggests an analogy with socialism. Stereotyped, racist thinking will get us nowhere.</p> <h2 id="all-those-who-toil">All Those Who Toil</h2> <p>At the same time that marriage was contractualized in the United States and the tradition of common law marriage was left behind—a moment that cannot be detached from post-Reconstruction attempts to craft a legal regime that could restore slavery in all but name—the ‘nuclear family’ division of domestic and paid labor took shape. Similar divisions of labor developed around the same time in other centers of developed capitalism such as England and Australia under the influence of surging racketized and reformist labor movements.</p> <p>In the global south, things developed differently. The exploitation of women in domestic familial work and private wage labor became deeply integrated. In India, construction companies use contractors to hire husband-wife (<em>jodi</em>) pairs from marginalized communities as migrant laborers with little to no social security. The wife is hired not only for construction labor but also for the social reproduction of the family. She is expected to take care of the children, cook, and do all other miscellaneous tasks required to sustain her family. The children that accompany the pairs help with the menial tasks of construction labor when they are not occupied with ragged public schools (if they even have the opportunity to attend schools, given the nature of short term migrant labor). They are trained as construction workers from their childhood due to their proximity with the work.</p> <p>Unlike the expectations of the early socialists and most liberals, capitalism’s dynamic of constant expansion absorbed, reterritorialized, and reproduced traditional gendered forms of domination rather than eliminating them. The garment industry and spinning mills of Tamil Nadu, which export a sizable portion of its product to the international market, are powered by the labor of teenagers. Girls from very poor backgrounds are contracted for three years, housed in small dorms, and made to work for stipends much lower than minimum wage. However, their income over the course of their three year long tenure is just enough for their dowry as they reach legally marriageable age. The loop is closed, and the racket continues.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>From a purely economic-functional perspective, marriage (and indeed cohabitational relationships outside of marriage) almost appear as a sentimental residue coating the mechanisms of the household system, that uneasy compromise between private property and human existence. The stripping of the vestigial religious trappings around marriage and the abolition of its monopoly on romantic pairing and cohabitation should reduce the family to what economists say it always was: a vehicle for provisioning of commodities to satisfy basic humans needs (food, shelter, etc.), the transmission of property, and pooling of income/wealth. But this does not happen. Every time an antique legal pretense for the subordination of women within the household is struck down, a new or previously dormant piece of law—accompanied by a political-ideological campaign—seems to crop up and ‘inadvertently’ divert the path of progress.</p> <p>This is not a purely political outcome. The nexus of gendered labor in the household-family locus cannot disappear into the ‘automatic’ mechanisms of value because it brushes up against an objective limit to capital, namely the reproduction of labor power. Both the micro- and macro-rhythms of corporeal human life, insofar as they are even understood, are fundamentally out of sync with the mechanical rhythms of capital’s accumulation, circulation, and turnover. Scientific management of the human body already has a name: torture. The unprofitable tasks of care are therefore bestowed upon non-profit institutions (schools, hospitals, etc.) and individuals.</p> <p>Legal-political reinforcement of gender—and hence its concomitant forms of exploitation and subordination—can thus be seen, at least in part, as an opportunistic attempt to foist this anomalous labor back on those who, for historical reasons, have little power to refuse it. The housewife phenomenon persists because the domestic work of social reproduction is unprofitable and cannot be made into capitalist production, nor can existing production absorb it as labor-power.</p> <h2 id="the-game-was-rigged-from-the-start">The Game Was Rigged From the Start</h2> <p>It has been said that to transition is to renege on agreements that were previously assumed, albeit never actually signed for. The same goes for coming out in general. Some queer people are lucky, born to kind parents and/or a relatively accepting milieu. Most are confronted with the prospect of giving up the protections of various institutions of social reproduction—the family, the hegemonic order of gender, medical and psychiatric standards of normality—because the forms of domination that accompanied them were unbearable. The simple day-by-day practice of living outside them represents a non-negligible form of resistance against them.</p> <p>Oftentimes trans people in particular are thrown headfirst into continual underemployment, if not outright unemployment and even lumpen conditions. They may be patronized or brutalized depending on the valences of their class background, social milieu, and particular gender (e.g. the different but overlapping strategies for policing trans women vs. trans men). The grim realities facing queer and trans people bely the accusation—sometimes explicit, sometimes merely implied—that they are somehow an economically privileged group.</p> <p>Queer people in general and trans people in particular are a small minority of the population with minimal political influence. Why, then, does the granting of very limited legal measures of acceptance provoke such an apocalyptic sense in our enemies? One always finds the same stereotyped accusations: queerness is a threat to the family and children, and therefore the nation and race. It is a threat to “nature,” “man,” and “civilization.” Of course, it is in the obverse that we see the true face of death—empty identity and silent obedience to authority. The mildest suggestion of a queer aporia in the gender regime sets off the obsessive policing instinct of its loyal attack dogs. The passion with which these dogs are called to defend the holy gender relation betrays their correct intuition of how fragile this supposed ‘eternal’ ironclad structure really is.</p> <p>One can be seduced by a thinking that invokes symbolic abstractions of power like “identity” and “death.” We must never forget that behind the pageantry of gender reaction lurks an all too concrete threat of murder, punishment delivered for the crime of a free participation in life.</p> <h2 id="nothing-for-nothing">Nothing for Nothing</h2> <p>A liberal manager’s lament: his ‘white working class’ brothers in their ignorance fight for austerity (Trump, Le Pen, Reform). His Daily Politics Observer soothingly repeats a watered-down Du Bois ad nauseum in explanation: poor whites did this because in exchange they receive psychic returns. Is there fruit that hangs lower? Such retreats to psychological compensation arguments are lamentable but understandable given the lack of any clear economic benefits in their political programs. Have elites secured the replacement of material economy by the psychic economy of ideology? We don’t think so. Psychological gratification at the level of social effectivity cannot be engineered by the ruling class so readily, if indeed at all.</p> <p>Psychic economy is everywhere in constant interpenetration with the material economy. Money writes “invasion” on the wall. White flight follows, motivated by immediate racial resentment and reinforced through positive economic motivations. Suburban areas come to have genuinely superior infrastructure and tax resources to the ‘inner cities.’ The wages of whiteness take the form of inclusion in ever-shrinking welfare societies, and the willingness to accept the racialized exclusions which those societies always involved. Fantasies of whiteness provide an alibi for this increasing austerity. Welfare is condemned in racially-charged invectives, conveniently omitting mention of the racially exclusive benefits enjoyed by the caucasian contingent—what we might call ‘white-fare.’</p> <p>Each citation, whether explicit, tends to omit the gist of <em>Black Reconstruction</em>, that actually making good on racist gambles is essentially impossible. The poor white places a poor bet. The contract’s rewards grow little with time. Under the spell of “invasion,” each vote exchanges upkeep for “security” until security takes the wheel. “Invasion” gets bigger still, cast in fulsome neon, on chyron, marquee. Clearly, the ‘forgotten man’ can do no better than a gun bought with what remains. What else can protect the little box whose mortgage is subprime? Money, now “Equity,” may foreclose, but the real box of white fantasy was always the womb, the genetic line of credit, which the gun can certainly protect. After all, strange fruit hangs higher. If all else fails, there’s apples on the sportsbook, with free money on the first parlay.</p> <h2 id="stupidity-machines">Stupidity Machines</h2> <p>The appeal to stupidity as an explanation for some social fact is generally an argumentative move that only serves to expose the intellectual debility of its own executor. Submission to this tendency would itself be a submission to stupidity however, a tacit acknowledgement of its impenetrability to the intellect.</p> <p>Cruelty and stupidity go together. Reactionary attacks on the academy are less explained by the claim that it is a base of principled resistance—it is not—than by the right’s fundamental revulsion at learning and sense that their sadism can be lazily indulged by bludgeoning a victim too cowardly to fight back. (Also, since when have elementary schools been part of ‘the academy?’) It is a testament to the idiocy of the political situation that we are told to avoid “sanewashing” the policies of reaction.</p> <p>Stupidity is not a scar; it is a festering wound. Through his battles with the sophists, Plato’s Socrates proved that to do evil to another is to make both oneself and one’s victim worse. Thus, cruelty appears as a vector for stupidity. Deprivation and punishment have no educational value, and any society which turns such viciousness into socially load-bearing practices will inevitably turn its back on whatever culture had once been enabled by brutal enforcement of the distinction between hand and head. Today’s plague of stupidity exacerbates the ambient regime of fear inherent to our violent society into an unending chain of moral panics, which today find their cultural expression in a foul cornucopia of AI-generated images and videos.</p> <p>The explosion of AI propaganda symbolizes the construction of a new Babel—in reverting to the supposedly universal language of images, we will eventually be cursed with the inability to understand one another. Media constructs us as passive consumers and proud reproducers. It is not uncommon for someone to casually announce that they rely on Chat GPT for emotional support. They might as well have just come out as a proud coprophage, for the difference between the proud and shameless consumption of ‘slop’ and eating one’s own shit is one of appearance, not essence.</p> <h2 id="fascicules">Fascicules</h2> <p>The ballot box is a lever of fascization, but not because some mythical poor whites are forced to sign on to fascism for economic reasons. The secret ballot of liberalism posits fascism as one ticket among others, a personal choice. (The degree of political divergence between men and women makes it statistically certain that a non-trivial number of heterosexual couples in many countries are made up of a fascist man and a liberal woman). In reality, the ballot is an index of the alienated pseudo-individuality assumed by <em>Citoyen</em> <em>Sujet</em> when confronted by the state.</p> <p>Even when open fascism does not appear on the ballot, the fascism of imperialism is always a fundamental part of the hegemonic consensus. This is without getting into the islands of fascism that dot liberal capitalist society—Guantanamo Bay, European and American concentration camps for migrants and refugees, Zionist apartheid, prisons in general, your local police precinct, etc. Each of these are socio-magnetic accelerators for what Trotsky famously called “particle[s] of Hitler,” or, better yet, fascicules.</p> <h2 id="gregarious">Gregarious</h2> <p>Critics of so-called ‘identity politics’ attack the concrete manifestations of the tendency to associate in the name of a class association which does not presently exist. This is quite an untimely critique, as for most proletarians today class is precisely an abstract social category whose force is only felt negatively (much to the chagrin of contemporary vulgar workerists).</p> <p>It is just as easy for ‘class politics’ to fall into racketeering as it is for ‘identity politics’ (leaving aside the fact that many forms of ‘identity politics’ simply are class politics in a special idiom). They are both rather elementary political forms of basic human groupishness. Group life is as fundamental to <em>homo sapiens</em> as walking upright and making tools. This is the kernel of truth to liberal hysterics about “tribalism” and its rise—a discourse that runs both class and identity politics through the wash of primitivizing abstraction, ridding them of the impurities of class antagonism that underlie their qualitative unity-in-difference and reducing them to the bleach white husk of pure rackets. If we peer further into the hidden abode of this discursive production a further truth is revealed: That behind the obfuscating immediacy of its product lie the very forces of separation that impart groups themselves with the the violent rhythms and high pressure conditions that characterize their contemporary form and deprive us of the kind of group life given to collective learning.</p> <p>The influence of psychological factors in the composition and decomposition of political groups is often neglected at the level of theory. (It is almost as if organization is a method to overcome the brute animal mind, to subdue the spirited and appetitive parts of our souls.) We detect a fear in this neglect, a fear that mere acknowledgment of such factors would debase the political subjectivity of militants and confirm reactionary accusations of resentment and instability. But anyone who has been in a group—that is, anyone whatsoever—can tell you that association invariably introduces new psychological dynamics and does little to suppress preexisting ones. Bion’s simple observation stands the test of time: “It is clear that when a group forms the individuals forming it hope to achieve some satisfaction from it. It is also clear that the first thing they are aware of is a sense of frustration produced by the presence of the group of which they are members.”</p> <h2 id="smedleys-theory">Smedley’s Theory</h2> <p>People in the first half of the twentieth century could not decide whether aerial warfare was chivalrous or barbaric—they had forgotten that these terms are coextensive. Fighter planes served to gather intelligence for artillery bombardments and later to protect bombers. It is a testament to the impotence of empathy that warplanes can be an object of admiration after Hiroshima.</p> <p>Today bombing insulates the masses of the first world, and of the United States in particular, from the realities of war. By permitting, at the technological-logistical level, ‘non-war’ military adventures (they were called “police actions” by the British Empire) to use minimal direct combat personnel, bombing rescued the population from mobilization and the ruling class from the travail of legitimating mobilization.</p> <p>In the case of drone warfare, combat personnel is entirely forgone. The proliferation of jamming devices in the Russo-Ukrainian war has led both militaries to control their close-range first person view “suicide drones” with spools of fiber optic cable, which after detonation are left eerily draped across the artillery-battered landscape. A bundle of consumer technlogies—VR headsets, hobbyist quadcopters, etc—combine into a militarized cybernetic organism that simulates the suicide of its operator and actualizes the murder of its target. The ‘divine wind’ that possessed Japanese <em>kamikaze</em> pilots is warded off by the technological ritualization of interfacing with death.</p> <h2 id="spark">Spark</h2> <p>Imperialist genocide is legitimated by the blackmail of extinction. The hypertrophy of humanity’s capacity for destruction has transformed the foundation of the distinction between the sovereign civilization of the first world and abject violability of the third into the former’s ability to initiate a planetary extinction event at will.</p> <h2 id="descendants-of-cain">Descendants of Cain</h2> <p>How can Americans confront their Pilgrim Fathers? A positive reading: they were a cooperative body, though admittedly not freely associated, seeing as they were contractually bound. Everything in the colony was to be common stock for seven years, so perhaps they were even socialists of some kind. (In the event, they lasted only three before dividing the land they had claimed into separate plots for each family.) A negative reading: they were a unit of productive capital, the proceeds of which would be meted out to the ‘adventurers’ (investors) and ‘planters’ (settlers) after seven years. <em>Omnia sunt communia</em>, but only until the creditors come calling.</p> <p>Bizarre social set-ups like that of the Pilgrims are one of the more remarkable features of early stage settler-colonial projects. The penal society of New South Wales and early kibbutzim of Mandatory Palestine must also be mentioned in this context. While the settlers of Australia’s ‘First Fleet’ had no say in the matter, the utopian appeal of religious toleration in the case of the Pilgrims and an apparently socialist project in the case of Zionism certainly played an important part in the growth of these settler-colonial movements. Even Thomas More’s Utopia was a colonial endeavor, having been founded by King Utopus, who conquered the peninsula of Abraxa and immediately forced the “rude and uncivilised inhabitants” to dig a massive channel such that the landmass was made into an island.</p> <p>A common thread in these settler-colonial projects is a pretension to universalism—democracy, socialism, moral improvement, religion—which serves as a mask for the advance of particularity. Indeed, there is a certain destructive intertwinement of the universal and particular that is peculiar to settler-colonialism. The petty sovereignty of the settler emerges from his—and later <em>her</em>—proprietorship in combination with the assumption of the sovereign’s power, which is not merely particular but positively singular, in the specific capacity of violence. <em>De jure</em> claims on territory were (and are) made <em>de facto</em>, in large part, through the parcelized conquest carried out by especially bold settlers who rely on the state to back them up if needed. When individual prosecution of social war against the native begets resistance, the interloper finds themself being struck down with whatever weapon was at hand. For the wages of the settler’s sin is death, a pseudo-martyrdom that lifts up their vengeful spirit to circulate eternally in the world-soul of empire.</p> <h2 id="arrows-without-maxims">Arrows Without Maxims</h2> <p>Going back and reading reports about “fascism” (or the “alt-right”) from the last decade, one is struck by how much attention was given to ultimately ephemeral organizations and personalities.

The fatal flaw was that he could only see the excluded as harbingers of destruction, assigning any positivity they possessed to the dynamism of their Slavic blood and leaving serious social analysis by the wayside. In this context, we can say that Bakunin’s consistency provides a refreshing contrast to Marx’s moralistic and largely arbitrary distinction between the “reserve army of labor” and “paupers” on one hand and the “actual lumpenproletariat” on the other. Marx told two marginally different stories about the origins of these two groupings: the former were a product and necessary condition of capitalist production and the latter was the spoiled refuse of all the ruined classes of history. In both of these stories, Marx chose not to emphasize the fact—of which he was well aware—that informal labor, including many of its ‘criminal’ varieties, was a necessary element in both the reproduction of the working class and in the valorization process of capital. Perhaps he couldn’t figure out how to fit it into the argumentative structure of <em>Capital</em>. The actual reason doesn’t matter.</p> <p>Conditions of informality and nebulous, sub-legal wage agreements are hegemonic in many parts of the world. While some arrangements may be classified as mere formal subsumption of labor under capital, it can be comfortably said that most are structured from the ground up in line with the institutions of mature capitalism. Companies hire workers on short contracts without granting legal recognition of the workers as employees subject to rights and benefits. Workers are constantly cycled out. A large reserve of labor waits, ready to sign these contracts in hopes of being those whose diligence and work ethic would finally translate to full time employee status. Informality is the state of constant insecurity: the displacement of people from one occupation to another and from one location to another.</p> <p>Alongside informal employment, one inevitably finds two other sources of income in the ‘grey economy.’ Firstly, there are the forms of small proprietorship so miniscule in scale and laden with self-exploitation that describing them as “petty bourgeois” seems euphemistic, if not sarcastic. (Although one must not lose sight of the genuine petty capitalists in the so-called informal sector.) Secondly, there are the various less than legal ways of earning money: sex work, theft, fraud, trade in illegal goods, begging, etc. All three factors might be practiced in the same household, or by the same person at different times. Add to this a preponderance of debt—owed to either traditional loan sharks and moneylenders or modern microfinanciers—and circular patterns of migration between the city and the countryside, and a basic picture of the situation begins to emerge.</p> <p>From Marx to Adorno, the utopian hope that capitalism would give the conditions for socialisation of production was never realized. The functioning of capitalism has always been highlighted by its integration of traditional forms of hierarchy and conditions of informality. Throughout capitalism’s long history, there was never a period of truly liberal free competition and social security for workers. Spatial metaphors that place the so-called surplus population ‘outside’ of the circuits of capital are grievously outdated. Even during its brief heyday in the Global North, capitalism functioned through the dispersion of informality and the mobilization of traditional and direct forms of domination. This is only more so the case in the Global South. The household labor of lower caste women and the production of luxury products throughout the world are part of the same process.</p> <h2 id="the-dissection-of-god">The Dissection of God</h2> <p>Ambedkar wrote that caste is a graded hierarchy: thousands of groups tediously segregated and placed in a rigid order of rank, most of them content with their relative position. At least they aren’t the untouchables excluded by civilised society: those who are occupied with sanitation work, manual scavenging, and the dead. The ones who clean are the ones excluded, or rather polluted; women, like the lower castes, are ‘naturally’ polluted as they bleed, bear children, and are bound to take care of the household. Thus the long history of the Indian subcontinent has been a history of caste rackets based on the exclusion of dalits and women, rackets that effectively monopolised whole industries into their enclosures and subsumed everyone who came in contact with them. The Buddhist social reformers, the Muslim empires, the British Raj, and the Christian missions were all deeply integrated within caste society. Contrary to what Indian law would have us believe in an attempt to exclude positive discrimination from non-Hindu Dalits, castes do not have a religion apart from the Brahminical domination that ties the subcontinent together. After all, no one wants to clean their own shit.</p> <p>Caste society is an unending initiation ritual. It begins even before birth, as the Brahmin astrologer prescribes the auspicious time of birth and name for the child based on the movements of the stars. Then come the rituals of the girlchild entering puberty—for she is ready to reproduce her caste—and the very tedious marriage customs ordained by the Brahmins. Any resistance to the predetermined initiation and its cyclical history becomes a grave threat to caste society; neither hints of romance between individuals from unequal castes nor even simple physical entry into upper caste spaces are permitted. These norms are to be punished by extreme violence or murder if breached. The Brahmin would rather kill his own daughter than be initiated into a Dalit world. The famous <em>dharma</em> or duty of Hindu mythology is the duty of being bound to caste rackets, of following their intricate rules and rituals. Rather than affirm the universality of everyone’s duty to the other, the myth affirms the totality of caste relations. No wonder that the deity King Rama became the favored figure of modern Hindutva. The avatar who would subject his wife to the ordeal of fire to save the honor of his caste becomes the model of duty bound Hindus, who imagine themselves saving the honor of their religion against the perceived threat of the Muslim invaders.</p> <p>Caste is far from being a national-religious bulwark against Islam. Indeed, castes exist only insofar as certain groups can dominate other groups ‘below’ them. The upper castes have access to superior conditions of social reproduction and are availed of the need to dirty their own hands. They dominate others and thereby exclude themselves from manual labor. As Ambedkar argued, castes are “enclosed classes” maintained throughout their long history by endogamy and its necessary presupposition: control over women’s bodies. In capitalism, caste society is fully integrated into a capitalist division of labor that reproduces and maintains its enclosure. As Dalits are relegated to the informal economy and bound to undignified, unseen labour, the so-called caste Hindus are allowed to enter into formal contracts recognized as workers, bosses, and <em>Maliks</em>. Caste society is racket society par excellence.</p> <h2 id="chinga-la-migra">Chinga la Migra</h2> <p>Exploitation of—and subsequent dependence on—migrant labor is a feature common to many countries in both the Global North and Global South, from Singapore to South Africa. The presence of legally designated <em>Untermenschen</em> has become something natural for those lucky enough to possess citizenship. Despite their undeniable presence within the ‘host country’ both physically and socio-economically as nannies, manual workers, intellectuals, neighbors, and more, they are marked as outsiders. Such a hegemonic system of brutality invariably wrongs the migrant, but the citizen is likewise scarred by the stability of their own identity and position. The mere existence of the legal category of ‘citizen’ is a sign of social dysfunction, a veritable mark of the beast branded on the body politic possessed by the devil.</p> <p>This dysfunction operates via a meshwork of legal, ideological, and interpersonal layers; put most succinctly, it operates like a racket. Take for example the infamous kafala system in the GCC countries. In the popular consciousness, kafala evokes a uniform system of migrant labor administration, one that has little variation among the GCC countries. It elicits an impression of an <em>exceptional</em> site of exploitation, isolation, and degradation. In fact, it is often thought about as modern day ‘slavery.’ While these impressions contain truth, they remain obfuscatory, reinforcing the false self-conceptualization through which the racket presents itself.</p> <p>In brief, the kafala system is a worker-sponsorship regime of migrant governance, one that can be broadly conceptualized as a nexus of governmental policies and laws common to all GCC countries, despite some key differences between them. A large portion of the labor importation facilitated by the kafala system is domestic labor, a sector usually seen as external to the labor relation of migrant-citizen. Indeed, the migrant domestic laborer in the Persian Gulf reveals the true nature of the kafala racket not as an exceptional site of labor exploitation, but as an <em>exemplary</em> one. The purity—if we can call it that—of the kafala system sheds light on the luxury fashion sweatshops of Italy, strawberry farms of California, and industrial exploitation of rural <em>Hukou</em> workers of China. It exists only through a contingent configuration of the grotesquely uneven international division of labor, where the state outsources labor governance onto the family unit. This arrangement has become both the primary structure of class antagonism and an indispensable element of social reproduction in the GCC countries.</p> <p>From this lens, the kafala system reveals itself as an exemplary racket. It generates ideological cover through conceptual sleight-of-hand: accommodation of international labor rights appears as a threat to “national state autonomy”; the citizen-migrant relation fuses with the employer-worker relation into a single hierarchy of power; and exploitation itself is recast as interpersonal bonds requiring loyalty and gratitude. The racket’s insider/outsider logic produces mutually reinforcing delusions—the state postures as guardian of citizen privileges against foreign intrusion, thereby binding citizens to defend state authority as an extension of their own standing. The citizen manages the impossible task of managing residents as perpetual outsiders, guarding a guest-host fiction that depends on willful blindness—the ultimate expression being lawmakers raised by migrant domestic workers now advocating nationality quotas against their own social mothers.</p> <p>The kafala system’s displacement of labor governance onto families represents just one variation among migrant labor rackets. Across different contexts, these systems share a common logic of mystification, though their specific mechanisms vary considerably. In India, internal migrant labor operates through caste and kin networks that create their own form of displaced governance and funnel workers into specific industries in the urban centers. The workers do not have any attachment to the place or region, only to their own caste groups and the industry—workers are hired from distant villages precisely because it hinders effective class solidarity. Development projects that displace the native population and highly polluting industries have an especially large section of migrant workers, who become a scapegoat for the misery caused by the industry. Indian labor is also strongly represented outside of the subcontinent: manual workers go to the Gulf, and intellectual workers try to find a more permanent home in one of the countries of the First World. The United States’ H1-B visa for skilled workers is especially prized.</p> <p>But H1-B has come under fire recently. In the controversy amongst the American right about the H1-B visa program and similar schemes, it is hard not to see the extreme white nationalist side of the debate as the bad conscience of its “globalist” counterpart. H1-B is merely a legal formalization of the type of domination that employers have been able to exert over migrant workers of all skill levels for decades, with deportation being among the most severe acts of domination at their disposal. The US deportation legal regime emerged from many of the worst bodies of Anglo-American law: English common law on “vagabonds,” the fugitive slave laws, and late 19th century anti-Chinese legislation. (With regard to the latter, we cannot forget the unhappy history of the American labor movement, however weak it was, in legitimizing anti-immigrant legislation.) The practice of deportation intersected with citizenship law—which was explicitly racial until the 1950s—and the social institution of race. The resulting non-identity of legal-racial, social-racial, and citizenship statuses historically made it very easy for the state (with consent from capital) to deport both resident Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans with legal citizenship.</p> <p>The Republican Party (and the ruling class in general) probably does not actually have a worked out plan for immigrants—how could they devise a solution when they cannot even agree on what the problem is? We can still offer our own hypothesis, however. The dream brewing in the minds of the politicians who float the possibility of a ‘special military operation’ in Mexico and demand ICE gestapo squads be sent into every barrio is precisely that of an updated version of the old Bracero program that would take inspiration from the modern kafala system, if not some even more entrenched system of apartheid. (When Trump opines that “people who live in the inner city” can no longer be forced into agricultural labor, is he not giving the game away?) By removing immigrants from society at large, they hope that the citizenry will forget that they are anything other than disposable bodies that can be deported to free-fire zones or concentration camps when they’ve exhausted their utility for capital.</p> <p>Such an attack inevitably provokes a response, however. The level of ongoing resistance against rapidly fascisizing immigration authorities in the US and the centrality of anti-immigration politics to the so-called populist right globally are confirmations of Marcuse’s hypothesis that the regime of preventative counter-revolution in the first world is organized precisely against <em>international</em> revolution.</p> <h2 id="and-still">And Still…</h2> <p>With the development of modern industrial technology, the problem of temporal particularism is posed. The state of humanity’s material culture means that even defensive campaigns can make us all worse off in the long run. One often hears the argument that the politicians who fight against ‘responsible’ climate politics do not care because they will not be around to experience the consequences. They have annihilated the future and turned away from its morbid face in order to maintain their position in the mutilated present, from which everything both good and bad seems thinkably infinite. It is the second childhood of capitalist society.</p> <p>And yet, it is too easy to attribute evil to age. The bellicose posture of the United States’ gerontocrats less resembles the senile rage of a declining Faustian West than it does the premature senescence of a punch-drunk fighter who is still tough enough to hurt everyone around him. (The recent announcement that the UFC plans to hold an event at the White House in 2026 suggests that the elective affinity between brain injury and reaction may be even greater than we are suggesting.)</p> <h2 id="fossil-fuel">Fossil Fuel</h2> <p>With the invention of the steam engine the inert carbon stores of extinct plant and animal matter were transformed into the fuel for the expansion of the capitalist form of commodity production. Rather than acting as mere objects of labour like other extracted resources, fossil fuels immediately appeared as a means of labour: actualized as the lifeblood of the machines to which the workers were made mere appendages and, in this way, rendered just as lifeless as the long dead creatures burning in the furnaces. This was traditionally understood as a dual process of transformation and actualisation, the work of an active human industry upon a passive nature. However, here we see the roles dialectically reversed: set free from the land by human hands, the dead could now be put to work once more as a force of production by which those hands would be transformed, shackled and shackling all life to the same fate.</p> <p>Now, flash forward 200 years into the future.</p> <p>Here the internal combustion engine and its commercial reproduction have become ubiquitous. The dead now increasingly function not only as the lifeblood of production but also that of circulation. Humanity and commodities are freer than they ever were before and, so transformed, their labour and their price may be actualised anywhere on Earth. Commodities flow from where they are cheapest to produce to where they command the highest price. Workers find themselves commuting ever greater distances at ever greater velocities to ever greater personal cost, whether that be from suburb to city or by migratory flows attracted to whatever mass of capital is revving its engine. On the highways, skyways, railroads and shipping routes, everywhere the dead keep us hurtling towards extinction.</p> <p>Next figure:</p> <p>The angel of history is at a crossroads. Where one great car crash unceasingly takes shape. The headwinds of onrushing vehicles fill its wings, blowing it back seemingly in all directions. Can this catastrophe be averted? Could we not have changed course? With what, then, does it end? If there exist answers to these questions, they are to be found in the fragments, the fossils, recoverable from that one immense pile of rubble on rubble already accumulated by the roadside. These dead actualities of history are too the figures of a world not-yet living. While the dead remain doomed to labour upon the living and transform us into living-dead, both remain but fuel for progress.</p> <h2 id="protocols">Protocols</h2> <p>Conspiracy theorists are beholden to the positivistic illusion that, because everything must supposedly decompose, in some metaphysical-epistemological way, into individuals, the most efficient way to discover the truth is biographical investigation of individuals. The man who storms a pizza place in search of tortured children is closer to science than the one who believes the truth lies in an exegesis of half century-old tabloids and pulp literature. What unites them is the untimely belief in the power of truth for the purposes of propaganda, a belief which the theorist cannot maintain forever when faced with the unbearable futility of his interventions. The consequent lamentation for the errance of the deceived masses leads inevitably to a (shockingly pleasurable!) elitist turn inwards, the coining of shibboleths and code-words, and esoteric writing practices. The discourse that ultimately emerges is just as inscrutable, exclusive, and partial as the “academic” paradigm it was originally organized against.</p> <h2 id="well-theres-your-problem">Well, There’s Your Problem</h2> <p>‘Conceptual engineering’ is a dead end. Disinfected of any germ of radicality that may have once persisted in it. The conceptual assembly line of the academy produces, post hoc, the pretext for whatever the ruling class are already doing, while at the same time delimiting the discourse such that any theoretical resistance can be simply reincorporated into the ideological infrastructure. The view of solidarity that such thought has produced is one of pragmatic collective action amongst various interest groups, a rationality which still retains the essence of social domination. This racket realism is what Horkheimer called “the mind of class society in its streamlined form.” It does not regard the concept from the perspective of transformation but constructs schemas and categories by which these groups would articulate themselves in prearranged forms and in prearranged ways “completely alien to their own nature.” When the people, or the concept, will not comply with his purposeful rule, the engineer throws up his hands in mock surrender. The engineer’s concept was not wrong; it just needed some tinkering. There are blind spots in our thinking—no doubt! But it is simply a matter of review and refinement. Put the hammers down, you luddites! The system will be working soon.</p> <h2 id="teleology">Teleology</h2> <p>It seems that, to a greater extent than the other classes in capitalism, the petty bourgeoisie (whatever it may be that is designated by this term) can only achieve unity by first dividing itself and waging an ‘internal’ struggle. Whatever coherence the concept obtains at the level of theory emerges out of historical struggles whose outcome was not (and is not) predetermined. Where one particular occupational cohort—say, public school teachers—stands in the political situation is not an immediate consequence of its relation to capital or the state.</p> <p>The political ambiguity of this amorphous ‘stratum’ sandwiched between the proletarian and the capitalist is as objective as it is immense. Even the degree to which they genuinely or even approximately enjoy the powers of private property (or mere usufruct ‘possession’) varies according to the vicissitudes of the economic conjuncture. Even the traditional petty bourgeoisie are often scarcely more than parasitic entities dependent on large firms. It makes little difference whether one interprets their position as order-givers subject to constraints from above or order-takers given limited powers over those below them. Their activity is structured by the division between intellectual and manual labor at the technical level, the social level, or both; this division is, in turn, part of the bedrock of class society—not something that can be abolished with the stroke of a pen. All attempts to introduce more ‘current’ or empirically specific substitute concepts are doomed to failure because they implicitly deny the fundamental multivalence of the object under scrutiny.</p> <h2 id="list-of-people-whose-ideas-we-took">List of People Whose Ideas We Took</h2> <p>In the absence of a traditional bibliography, please accept this (non-exhaustive) list of people whose ideas we have appropriated in the production of this text.

Morain from the <a href="/news/announcement_7">Spring 2025 Reading Group</a>. You’ll find both a transcript of an oral presentation and an original translation of K.A. Wittfogel’s “Natural Factors in Economic History” article transposed to the blog format. A few important notes: per the reading announcement, the below presentation builds from Wittfogel’s broader work on “Geographical Materialism,” and not the “Natural Factors” work alone. Moreover, this blog post is structured with the oral presentation first, followed by the translated excerpt. For the translation, please be advised that the footnotes were left untranslated as is. We hope these materials serve as an early eco-Marxist model for engaging with contemporary discussions on the value of nature, the dual character of labor-power as both “social” process and “natural” process, and the dynamic relationship between laborers and their geographical environment.</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>The CTWG Editorial Team</p> <h2 id="karl-august-wittfogels-system-of-historical-materialism-presentation">Karl August Wittfogel’s System of Historical Materialism (presentation)</h2> <p>Today we are going to discuss excerpts from two essays by Karl August Wittfogel. But, before we get into Wittfogel’s theories, I want to provide a quick biographical overview.<br/> Wittfogel was born in 1896 to a protestant family in Germany. He studied the humanities at university before being drafted into the German army in 1917. He then became a Marxist in the aftermath of the war, briefly joining Kautsky’s Independent Social Democrats before moving to the newly formed Communist Party in 1920. In 1921 he began pursuing what would become his main academic interest, the study of China within the social sciences. His first works are mainly historical, although he dabbled in philosophy of science/knowledge and wrote several stage plays. From the very start, his approach to social sciences was integrative and comparative. Thus, among his early historical writings are two comparative histories and a series of works on China which gradually focused more and more on the distinct particularities of Chinese society. Beyond his immediate interest in concrete socio-historical research, Wittfogel wanted to establish historical materialism as <em>the</em> science of history and supplant the works of theoretically “bourgeois” and politically right-wing German social scientists like Max Weber (a liberal) and Werner Sombart (a Nazi).</p> <p>It is interesting to note that in Wittfogel’s works from the 1920s, some of his theoretical formulations approach those of the great Russian Marxist theorist Isaak Illich Rubin or the German “New Reading of Marx” developed in the 1960s and 70s. For example, in his book <em>Die Geschichte der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft</em>, which, as the title suggests, is a history of (early) capitalism, he explains that his method for the book is to combine an explanation the “systematic-logical” economic categories of capitalism (as described by Marx) with a “class-history” of capitalism. He describes value as a “social relation” that coordinates the social production of separated and competing individual producers, praises Lukács’s <em>History and Class Consciousness</em> as one of the best recent works of Marxist theory, etc. The focus on class struggle and social relations contrasts very strongly with his later work. I bring this all up just so you understand that when Wittfogel dismisses Lukács as idealist, for example, he does not do this out of simple ignorance. We can still detect some traces of this period of “proletarian science” in Wittfogel’s critiques of geopolitical theory and bourgeois geographical materialism—he says bourgeois geographical materialism was flawed because the social position of the bourgeoisie led them to epistemic and scientific quagmires, whereas the standpoint of the proletariat allows a correct epistemic starting point for true materialism.</p> <p>Wittfogel’s outlook on historical materialism fundamentally changed after he read the works of the famous Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov. Plekhanov had emphasized natural and (especially) geographical factors to an unprecedented extent in his writings. This approach strongly resonated with Wittfogel, perhaps because it allowed him to use geographical factors to explain the different developmental trajectories that emerged in world history.</p> <p>Wittfogel’s new, Plekhanov-influenced version of historical materialism was first introduced in the first reading for today, the essay “Geopolitics, Geographical Materialism, and Marxism” from 1929. This essay was occasioned, as the title suggests, by the recent upsurge in geographical and “geopolitical” writing among both revisionist socialists (Horrabin, Graf) and far-right reactionaries (Haushofer, who was massively influential on the Nazis). According to Wittfogel, all “geopoliticians” new and old are characterized by “the combination of an ineffectual geographical materialism with a completely unfounded eclecticism.” They all combine idealist speculation on things like national spirit and The State with a stupid geographical materialism that can only analyze things based on their immediate appearance. The “geopoliticians” universally ignore the economy, the process of production, and the labor process—i.e., the real media by which nature exerts its influence on society.</p> <p>Eventually Wittfogel begins outlining his own theory. At this point I am going to turn to reconstructively summarizing his theory as given in the two readings. Because these writings are rather obscure, and one is being translated for the first time, I am focusing on summarizing and explaining, not evaluation. We’re going to start with his account of the labor process and then go into his theory of nature.</p> <p>Wittfogel sometimes calls the social labor process the “fundamental relation” [grundlegende Verhaltnis] (GGMM 41 et passim). The labor process is “fundamental” in the sense that it <em>is</em> the metabolic relation between humanity and non-human nature. As far as I know, Wittfogel was one of very few people who picked up on Marx’s concept of “metabolism” (Stoffwechsel) at this time; he also took up Marx’s interest in soil. Anyway, there are three components to the labor process: labor power, objects of labor, and means of labor—these are also the three main productive forces in society. I will treat them in the order just given.</p> <p>Labor power, like the other two components, has a social side and a natural side. The social side is the <strong><em>organization and qualification</em></strong> <strong>of labor power</strong>, i.e. the technique of individual work and the technical division of labor. In general, this is the <strong><em>application of knowledge</em></strong> <strong>or <em>science</em></strong><em>.</em> The natural side consists in “<strong>physiological characteristics, race, [and] national character.</strong>” The first is simple enough: the strength and endurance of the workers, but the latter two require a brief digression. <br/> Wittfogel, like Marx and Engels, was a believer in racial science. Indeed, his 800 page monograph on the economy and society of China begins with an investigation into the racial characteristics of the Chinese. It must be understood that his conception of racial science was rather unique. He was—like Trofim Lysenko—a Lamarckian, meaning he rejected Darwin’s theories and believed that acquired characteristics could be inherited. This in turn meant that racial differences could and would eventually be negated by the egalitarianism of socialist society. Despite his defense of race science, he still insisted that race was ultimately not that important and can pretty much be disregarded in historical analysis.</p> <p>So much for labor power. The <strong>objects of labor</strong> are very simple. Either they are <strong>natural materials or natural objects of labor</strong> (wild animals and plants, minerals, etc.) or they are <strong>“raw materials,”</strong> i.e. objects that have already been transformed by labor (domesticated organisms, pig iron, cloth, fibers, etc.) (GGMM 43). Wittfogel has an interesting argument that extractively sourced natural materials play a very important role in early hunter-gatherer society and industrial capitalism, but are relatively less important in agrarian forms of society (feudalism, “asiatic society,”) (GGMM, 46). The argument has significant plausibility when one considers how much labor in medieval times was based around lumber from cultivated and managed forests, domesticated animals and plants, products sourced from those animals and plants, and so on. Ultimately I am not knowledgeable enough to evaluate it, however.</p> <p>Now I turn to the <strong>means of labor</strong>. It is in relation to this topic that some of Wittfogel’s characteristic novel ideas emerge. Wittfogel’s opponents (in this case, Gorter and Cunow) reduce the means of labor to mere <em>technology</em> (maybe having an allowance for draft animals), and thus ignore the importance of <strong><em>natural means of labor</em></strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>Soil</strong> is a natural means of labor in agriculture; it is the medium by which seeds become plants. <strong>Water</strong> is a natural means of labor in fishing, aquaculture, agriculture, and the use of mills and turbines. Wittfogel notes, however, that the use of these means of labor often requires tools—hoes, spears, nets, shovels, etc. Moreover, they are modified by human labor (soil depletion, salinization, overfishing, etc.) Thus the natural means of labor, although they are decisively <em>not</em> a product of humanity, nonetheless have a distinctively <em>historical character</em>, <em>as do all naturally conditioned productive forces.</em></p> <p>Wittfogel introduced two concepts to elucidate the <em>historical character</em> of <em>naturally conditioned productive forces</em>, i.e. nature insofar as it is socio-economically relevant. He claims that QUOTE, “Industry and the state of society “produce” the natural environment in a twofold manner, firstly through <em>transformation</em>, secondly through the <em>actualization</em> of essential aspects of nature.” Transformation is “the immediate result of labor-activity;” it is the physical change in nature as a result of human action. Actualization (or de-actualization) is the process by which parts of nature QUOTE “take on relevance to man as a result of a change of standpoint occurring in the labor process.” For Wittfogel, transformation takes absolute priority; actualization requires transformation but not vice versa. Great revolutions in the mode of production—the invention of agriculture, stockpiling, whatever—begin a process of <em>maturation</em> in the new mode of production. This process of maturation leads—a bit too naturally in my opinion—to the <em>actualization</em> of new parts of nature via the novel <em>transformations</em> of nature that it calls forth. Within this historical pattern and within the labor process, nature is “passive” and humanity is “active.” Nature sets conditions, establishes laws, provides a “larder” of materials, and so on, while humanity transforms these materials within the bounds of the conditions and laws established by nature. In the final analysis, we must always remember that everything comes from nature and is ultimately “natural” — although, as I will discuss later, I sometimes find that Wittfogel <em>does</em> forget this fundamental fact.</p> <p>Turning back to history, stagnation in development presents some problems. For Wittfogel, stagnation means a problem with the productive forces, and hence with nature in the last instance. Either there are simply no new natural productive forces to exploit (what about trade?) or the new productive forces are in conflict with the existing mode of production (this sounds like a social problem to me!). As you can probably tell, I am pretty skeptical of Wittfogel’s position here. At his most extreme, Wittfogel uses this principle to deduce the entire historical trajectory of Asia from some elementary facts about the soil and climate of China: the climate lead to irrigation agriculture, which produced an irrigation bureaucracy, and this bureaucracy violently prevented the development of the “germ cells” of capitalism, of bourgeois class power, because they threatened the “central nervous system” of the irrigation economy. (NUWg 607-8).</p> <p>This is the famous (or infamous) <em>geographical</em> aspect of Wittfogel’s historical materialism. If you consult a text written a few years after our readings called “Theorie der orientalischen Gesellschaft” (The Theory of Oriental Society—it’s from 1938) you will find comparative tables that predict what kind of mode of production (nomadism, irrigation agriculture, rainfall agriculture) will develop based entirely on what sorts of water are available (rain, rivers, etc.). While each of these modes of production implies a distinctive class structure, their historical trajectory has no immediately apparent relation to class struggle. (The charts from that text contrast very strongly with similar comparative history charts from 1924’s <em>Geschichte der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft</em>; the latter are focused strongly on the outcome of <em>class struggles</em> and the relations of production more generally.) Ultimately, however, Wittfogel must appeal to class struggle and relations of production to explain why, for example, China and Japan (I would also add Korea) developed very differently from one another (see GGMM pp. 56-7).</p> <p>One may object that the development of technology abolishes dependence on nature in all forms. Wittfogel strongly disagrees, saying that “The significance of the natural factors grows together with the social conditions (force) of the process of production” (GGMM 47). “The dependence on natural conditions” does “[assume] an increasingly mediated character,” (GGMM 47), but the dependence remains, especially when it comes to raw materials. I do not object to that point, but the difference between “<em>dependence</em> on nature” or “<em>conditioning</em> by nature” and “<em>determination</em> by geography” becomes very apparent when we consider the possibilities created by technology. I think these are two fundamentally different forms of ‘determination’ (or whatever you want to call it) that relate to different <em>periods</em>, i.e. <em>different modes of production</em>. Referencing Plekhanov, he claims it would be “a blatant error to mistake the change of <em>form</em> for a <em>cessation</em> of the effects of the natural factor,” but he does not theorize these forms.</p> <p>Wittfogel squirmed away from this difference by appealing to the monopolization of raw materials that results from imperialist conquest—now he could still readily identify nation-states with certain raw materials and geographical resources. But consider a modern country like South Korea, which has a large manufacturing sector, produces essentially none of its own raw materials (it is the 3rd largest importer of metals in the world), and has no imperialist holdings. Clearly the extent of geographical determination has lessened considerably due to advancements in transport, technology, and global trade relations. Korea even uses irrigation agriculture! Clearly Wittfogel’s theory has some glaring problems vis-a-vis geography.</p> <p>The ‘other’ side of his account of nature also has some problems. For one, there is a distinct lack of reflexivity—where does this view of ‘passive’ nature come from? For whatever reason, Wittfogel did not feel compelled to justify this dualist, vaguely Aristotelian approach. The schematic division between natural and social components in the Geographical materialism paper is somewhat confounding. Only the rawest aspects of nature are “natural;” if I understand him correctly, domesticated organisms are a social element, not a natural one (or at least they are more social than natural). His treatment of so-called ‘human nature,’ or the ‘biological’ aspect of human existence is also lacking. There is no mention of evolution, probably because Wittfogel did not even believe in Darwinian evolution. This results in blindspots regarding the origins of tool use, the earliest kinds of technology, and the emergence of homo sapiens as a singular species on Earth more generally. Engels was already ahead of Wittfogel with his fragment on the role of tools in human evolution.</p> <p>I find further problems in Wittfogel’s definition of a mode of production. According to him, it is “the unity of material and personal productive forces in the entire concrete process of production [Gesamtproduktionsprozess] of a determinate epoche of society.” First of all, the definition is circular because elsewhere he defines epochs of society <em>as historical modes of production</em>. Where does this excess ‘epochal differentiation’ come from? The obvious answer is, of course, the relations of production and the superstructure. The process of production always entails the relations of production. What the Althusserians called the <em>technical relations of production</em> is called the <em>organization of labor-power</em> by Wittfogel, obscuring its social aspect. The way in which Wittfogel divides up the mode of production from the relations of production seems to me artificial and invalid. Recall the previously mentioned argument about the irrigation <em>bureaucracy</em> in China—that whole situation is a showcase of the social relations of production and the effects of the superstructure (the State) on the economic base via class struggle!</p> <p>“The structure of the contemporaneously active productive forces as a whole,” Wittfogel writes, “determines the economic structure of a historical epoch.” He adds that “This structure, however, is unified [faßt sich … zusammen] in the mode of production.” Due to the lack of any explanation, this ‘unification’ appears in his theory as something both totally <em>automatic</em> and totally <em>simple</em>. It is unclear <em>why</em> there is any unity at all, especially given the circularity of the definition. How is it unified in <em>historical time</em>? If it is a unity, then what does it mean for there to be a <em>conflict</em> between emergent and dominant modes of production? Wittfogel offers us no answers to these questions.</p> <p>Allow me to digress for a moment. It must be understood that Wittfogel’s view that mode of production more or less equals forces of production was not exactly orthodox, even for the time. We all know that Marx’s use of the term was inconsistent to say the least, so it was up to later Marxists to fix a definition. Bukharin, in stark contrast to Wittfogel, defined the mode of production as “the totality of the production relations;” it was only “<em>determined</em> by the development of the productive forces;” it did not <em>consist</em> of these forces. Kautsky, on the other hand, had a more expansive definition; he defined the mode of production with reference to the <em>totality</em> of socially connected labor processes, as the <em>nature</em> of the <em>overall</em> process of production including both its social and technical sides. Other authors (Lukács, Rubin, etc.) did not provide a formal definition for the concept of the mode of production, but tended to focus heavily on the ‘social side’ of things. Cunow commented that many considered the term synonymous with a technical description of the labor process. Ultimately, the definition found in Stalin’s 1938 pamphlet <em>Dialectical and Historical Materialism</em> (unity of forces and relations of production) became by far the most influential. (Honestly, Stalin’s definition is not bad as a starting point.) One of the greatest contemporary Marxist theoreticians, Jairus Banaji, has drawn attention to the concept of “laws of motion” in relation to the delineation of modes of production; I think this concept has great potential to connect with Wittfogel’s ideas of actualization and different views of nature. Etienne Balibar’s essay “The Basic Concepts of Historical Materialism” in <em>Reading Capital</em> also provides an interesting contrast, and perhaps correction, to Wittfogel’s theory.</p> <p>I’m not going to conclude with a summary of Wittfogel’s views, instead I’m going to say one good thing about Wittfogel’s theory and then a criticism of it.</p> <p><strong>On one hand</strong>, Wittfogel rightly gave nature a place in his theoretical constructions and invented new and compelling concepts to understand humanity’s changing relationship with nature.<br/> <strong>On the other hand</strong>, he made nature into the master of history and neglected social relations.<br/> <strong>On one hand,</strong> Wittfogel drew up a systematic presentation of the process of production and correctly recognized that nature was used as a ‘tool’ just like man-made technology.<br/> <strong>On the other hand,</strong> his analysis basically stopped at the process of production.<br/> I could go on like this for a while, but I hope you get the point.</p> <h2 id="translation">Translation</h2> <p>[Karl Wittfogel, “Die natürlichen Ursachen der Wirtschaftsgeschichte,” in: Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, 67 (1932), 466–492; 597-609; 711-731.]</p> <h2 id="2-nature-and-society-in-the-marxian-system">2.

Though within the labor process man may place a potentially gigantic apparatus of means of labor between himself and the object of his labor, the object of labor always remains nature itself. “Man and his labor on one side, nature and its materials on the other;” that is the most universal fundamental relation [Grundbeziehung] in the process of social labor, like this itself “an eternal natural condition of human life independent of every form of this life, but rather common to all social forms.”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> However, this means, just as Hegel already declared, that man, despite all the “power” over external nature that tools lend him, is “subjugated” by nature in the determination of his aims.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Lenin expressed this in his materialist commentary on Hegel’s <em>Logic</em> thusly: “The laws of the external world, of nature, which are divided into mechanical and chemical (this is very important) are the bases of man’s purposive activity. In his practical activity, man is confronted with the objective world, is dependent on it, and determines his activity by it.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p> <h3 id="a-natural-and-social-productive-forces">a. Natural and Social Productive Forces</h3> <p>The development of the social labor process, as the foundation of total social development, is the development of the <em>productive forces</em> that determine the character and efficacy of the labor process. Although [they are] historically conditioned as a collective, the productive forces do not all carry a social character in a <em>strict</em> sense. Two groups of productives forces function together in the labor process: produced and <em>not produced</em>, <em>socially</em> conditioned and <em>naturally</em> conditioned.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> All naturally conditioned (natural) productive forces have a <em>historical</em> character [Beschaffenheit]; only under certain historical circumstances do they become active [wirksam]. All social productive forces are, for their part, determined by the character of the corresponding active naturally conditioned productive forces.</p> <p>Now the subjective-personal element (labor qualification and organization) develops within the totality of <em>social</em> productive forces always in connection with and dependency upon the <em>material</em> [sachlichen] conditions of production.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> The material [sachliche] conditions of production—so-called <em>technology</em>—are, however, determined “by external conditions (the laws of nature).” Thusly did Lenin recently render again and with greater precision the corresponding thoughts of Hegel, Marx, and Engels. In the configuration of the “leading” means of his labor as well as in the realized social labor-activity that accompanies it, man depends on the “external world, nature” and “lets his activity be determined by it.” The laws of this external, natural world form “the foundation of purposive human activity.”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Marxistically [speaking], such a determinacy [Bestimmtheit] can only mean the determinacy of the path of development [Entwicklungsganges]. The <em>course</em> [Werden] of the social productive forces, centrally that of its material core, i.e. technology, is determined by the structure of the present moment in nature.</p> <p>In this sense Plekhanov explains—although admittedly with less precision than Marx and Lenin, since he, like most Marxists, did not adopt the concept of natural productives forces from Marx—that “the development of the productive forces, which in the last instance determine the development of all social relations, are themselves determined by the character of the geographical natural conditions.”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p> <p>We follow Marx’s distinction, which among Marxists Lenin was almost alone in accepting.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> By differentiating the thought put forward by Plekhanov, by tracing this thought back to Marx’s own conception, we can say that nature and society, the natural and social productive forces, “execute fundamentally different functions. Man and his social labor-activity represent the principle of unrest, of movement; nature (original or modified), the objective substratum which directs (or fails to direct) this activity in a definite direction through its material structure. Although man has an active relation to nature through the social labor process, at any given stage of the social forces of production he can only organize his activity in accordance with the natural means of labor and natural objects of labor he has plucked from the earth. Which naturally conditioned elements are “tapped” by socially-laboring man is above all determined by the totality of the socially developed forces of production (labor skills, science and its technological applicability, the organization of labor, the volume and efficacy of produced means of production). But the direction of the change in the social form of the process of labor (and whether there is a change at all) is not dependent on the arbitrary will of productive man but on the type, wealth and combination of the naturally conditioned forces of production socially “available” at any given time.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p> <p>“Motive [bewegend] activity and passive determination of direction;”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> these are the two essentially different functions that are performed by the two fundamental elements of the social labor process within every social formation.

But the principle, as well as the philological side of the question, should be clear. Marx, the dialectical materialist, saw the social labor process as proceeding in dependence upon its ultimate substrate, i.e. nature. This is where it is decided whether and in what direction changes in the labor process come about. Hence, the significance [definition?] of naturally conditioned productive forces. Hence the significance of the mode of production as the unity of all the productive forces, both the active, social side and the passive, direction-giving, natural side. No free will. No arbitrary choice [Willkür] in the development of material production. It is this, his materialist intransigence, that prompted Marx to designate the great epochs of production as the great historical <em>modes</em> of production (and not <em>relations</em> of production).</p> <p>The labor-technical structure [Gliederung] of an epoch, that is its material foundation. It is out of this [foundation] that the basic structure of society grows. The famous formula found in <em>The Poverty of Philosophy</em> (“The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill society with the industrial capitalist”<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>) may emphasize the individual means of production too strongly; the Marx of <em>Capital</em>, using a different starting point, may argue that it is the multiplicity of material conditions of production that is decisive, not an individual moment;<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> but this does not mean that one moment cannot play a particularly important role. The core materialist thought is not destroyed through these and similar, later remarks, rather only refined and made firm.</p> <p>“It is not what is made but how, and by what instruments of labour, that distinguishes different economic epochs.”<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> This thesis stands in the center of Marx’s magnum opus, the first volume of <em>Capital</em>. Since Marx included natural means of labor in [the category of] unproductive means of labor, he could assert his thesis without any “clarifying” additions of the kind that Kautsky believed he had to add to the apology for his poorly understood [version of] Marx.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> In this context [Zusammenhang], we once again recall [vergegenwärtige] Marx’s observations about the “<em>difference between different modes of production based on different means of production</em>” with the significant addition: “the connection between the social relations of production and those modes of production” (I, S. 345). The structure of the contemporaneously [jeweils] active productive forces as a whole determines the economic structure of a historical epoch. This structure, however, is unified [faßt sich … zusammen] in the mode of production.</p> <p>An economic-historical analysis that does not undermine the power—which is always emphasized even by non-Marxists—of Marx’s scientific tools,<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> but rather makes full use of them, cannot be satisfied with the approach [centered around the] <em>relations</em> of production. <em>The mode of production must first be laid bare</em>. So long as this path is not taken, we lack a true Marxist procedure, and instead only have an approximation at best.</p> <p>First of all, the mode of production! Within it, however, the naturally conditioned element of the productive forces must be fully illuminated. “All historical writing must set out from these natural bases and their modification in the course of history through the action of men.”<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> Will shall see what this means for the concrete construction of an economic-social history of man.</p> <h2 id="3-stagnation-and-development-in-humanitys-material-production">3.

Concrete economic-historical investigation shows that the significance of this moment—which is in no way fixed and unmodifiable—is thoroughly undercut by the effects of <em>objective</em> natural conditions, so an approach that (by necessity) has to disregard the former moment can proceed without leaving open major sources of error.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup></p> <p>So much more pressing is the question concerning the ‘whether’ and ‘why’ of the changes in objective nature during the course of history. Kautsky claims in his late work that “the meaning of technology and economy for the historical process is more decisive than that of nature.” Those moments would therefore be “more important for humanity … than these [i.e. nature],” because “those that form the <em>variable</em> element in the human environment, whereas nature, in contrast to human society, represented a relatively constant, unalterable element.”<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> It is this fixed conception of the relation between man and nature that either leads to a mechanical naturalism<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> or, in a false reaction to a false presupposition, to a backslide into an idealistic postulation of free will.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> The dialectical emphasis on the activity of laboring man as well as the reference to the repercussions [Rückwirkung] of this activity on the natural substrate eliminate the apparent weakness. The historically relevant nature in question, which scarcely changes in the course of human history without human intervention, nevertheless does not simply become, as Kautsky says, ever more manipulable by more developed technology.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> [Rather,] nature itself changes in the process of [its] interplay with socially laboring man. And so Feuerbach, according to Marx and Engels’ polemic that just as easily could have been directed at Kautsky, “[did] not see that the sensuous world around him is not a thing given direct from all eternity, remaining ever the same, but the product of industry and of the state of society.”<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p> <p>Industry and the state of society “produce” the natural environment in a twofold manner, firstly through <em>transformation</em>, secondly through the <em>actualization</em> [Aktualisierung] of essential aspects of nature.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> There is a distinction between the two forms of change, a distinction that does not eliminate the frequent (but not necessary) connection between them. <em>Transformation</em> of nature is the <em>immediate result of the labor-activity</em> of productive man: creation of an artificial steppe, artificial swamps (irrigation), cultivation of specific types of animals and plants (and the extermination of others), creation of new waterways, depletion of farmland or natural resources, fabrication of an artificial climate, etc., etc. <em>Actualization</em> (or <em>de-actualization</em>) of specific parts or properties of nature includes moments that take on relevance to man as a result of a <em>change of standpoint</em> [Standpunkänderung] occurring in the labor process, or which cease to be important for the process of production on these grounds. Accordingly, there can be no talk of those moments in nature that are essential for the human labor process remaining ever the same. In [certain] periods of history, nature (the cosmos) may undergo relatively little change in its total structure. In relation to socially laboring <em>man</em>, [nature] changes in a radical way [only] insofar as development occurs.</p> <p><em>Insofar</em> as development occurs. Indeed, there is no actualization of new naturally conditioned productive forces without a preceding transformation of elements of nature. The reverse does not hold true. <em>Not every transformation leads to actualization of new moments of nature</em>. The great problem of stationary economic orders emerges here. Australia, Africa, the East Indies, the great oriental cultural zone—all these historical complexes show us organisms of production, which, after a [period] of more or less prosperous development and with certain exceptions got into a position in which they still <em>transformed</em> [nature], but <em>actualized</em> no or almost no essentially new elements of nature. A universal economic history of humanity will have to assert that the greater part of the earth’s population belongs to a stationary sphere of life [Lebenskreis] (or belonged to one, in any case). These stagnating organisms of production were first propelled into new development by the only place where a breakthrough into industrial capitalism took place, Europe. Thus, it falls to economic history to explain not merely the <em>development</em> of different economic complexes, but also the incidents of halted development, of stagnation, which are no less important for the full historical picture.</p> <p>Not every transformation of natural matter into human use-value leads to the exploitation of new natural forces or makes new aspects of nature relevant [aktuell] for the labor process. Without the social process of production, whatever stage it may achieve, there is no actualization. Labor alone, however, is not sufficient. Labor must contain the possibility of a corresponding novel kind of activity [Betätigung]. Where this does not obtain, the process of production remains in the same spot. [In this case, then,] there is no development, merely repetition. Historically seen, there is stagnation.</p> <p>A unit of social life [gesellschaftliche Lebenseinheit] reaches a determinate stage of production: that of hunting and gathering, animal husbandry, agriculture. The beginning of activity in a new mode of production obviously cannot be one of complete utilization; a period of <em>maturation</em> follows. Either this maturation is realized in such a way that it merely advances to the exploitation of qualitatively similar elements and thus the quantitative advance does not reach the threshold of a novel quale [Quale]. This is the process that Müller-Lyer has given the name “lateral development.”<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> Or, the [process of] maturation makes the transition to essentially new elements possible. We could call this “vertical development,” a [kind of] development in the strict and genuine sense. In the second case, it succeeds in putting new natural forces in the service of production, be it the ability to produce animals and plants or mechanical or chemical properties of industrially useful materials. But, when is this <em>not</em> possible?</p> <p>I. The process of maturation stays stuck—and this goes for any stage [of development]—in lateral development because new naturally conditioned productive forces, on the basis of which the social productive forces could develop, are not available.</p> <p>II. Alternatively, new natural forces are available, but they were ‘tapped’ [erschlossen] under different circumstances [and under] another mode of production. [This] shows that they [the natural forces] <em>cannot be actualized</em> due to [the] totally determined structure of the productive forces of the achieved mode of production. This may (A) be grounded in the structure of the heretofore dominant kind of production [Produktionsart] itself (e.g. in the particularities of the slave-driven agricultural economy of late antiquity) or it may (B) have its cause in the specific antagonistic relations between the heretofore dominant and emerging spheres of production (a problem in the development of industrial capitalism in the womb of the great agrarian societies of Asia). Concrete historical research will have to determine which of these cases (I or II; A or B) it is dealing with.</p> <p>The metabolic process of historically determined social labor leads, in its transformation of nature, to the exploitation of new sides (properties) of nature, and if the qualitatively novel [element] is, firstly, essential for the modification of the labor process, and if it is, secondly, available not only haphazardly, but rather in general extent, then <em>a new view of nature</em> results for man, who is stimulated to new needs and sees new possibilities for production and consumption. Nature shows itself to man “from a new side.” After primitive groups took hold of fire, whether this was the result of a lightning strike, flowing lava, or, less possibly, an unforeseen side effect of drilling activity<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> [e.g. with a bow drill -J.E.M.], wholly new aspects of nature—wood as fuel, certain constellations of terrain protecting fires—became relevant [aktuell].</p> <p>After certain activities of a maturing hunter-gatherer economy [Sammelwirtschaft]—stockpiling, for example—led to understanding the possibility of conscious reproduction of useful plants, moments which were heretofore more or less irrelevant to man [working in the] new style of production (soil quality, the cultivability of certain plants) came to the foreground of his interests, his transformative social labor. The same procedure is repeated in the transition to animal husbandry, to artificial irrigation. Primitive tillage grows into use of the water supply. Success stabilizes need. From this point in time onwards, the structure of nature is revolutionized (not “in itself,” but for the [purposes] of laboring man at this stage). Rain, waterways, wind systems, and groundwater now take on a startlingly new utility for the sphere of life [Lebenskreis] of agricultural producers. A stream, which was previously taken as something neutral if not hostile, is now sought after, carefully observed, and taken into service. The actualization of rivers and seas for water transportation is one of the few significant examples in economic and cultural geography to emerge from the “sphere of commerce.” The maturation of textile work up to the point of wool spinning and weaving did not only depend on certain species of animals, but also on the land appropriate for their reproduction. The history of England and Spain shows what this actualization of arable land as sheep-runs could mean economically. The industrial history of the last century is the history of the general actualization of coal and a partial de- and re-actualization of iron (England) in connection with the decline of wood smelting and transition to coal-based ironworking. The maturation of mechanical-electrical energy production has made moving water relevant (watermills), irrelevant (steam engines), and relevant once again ([hydroelectric] turbines). Thus nothing is more false than the claim that nature stays ever the same, a constant factor, in the course of economic history. It changes, at least in simple ways, and even in multifaceted ways as development occurs. The fundamental relation is newly shaped by these changes stemming from the activity of laboring man, but is never abolished. No free will, not even for technically, productively active man. He may transform the landscape on his journey through the mountains. He may confront new tasks and prospects with every step of the path blasted into the cliffs. [But,] his path must adapt to the “passive” structure of the mountain. And he takes flight not from [the power of] his free will, but in compliance with new, deeper, and more complicated structural laws of nature. That is the dialectical, materialist theory of the Marxian conception of history.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>S. 472-481. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>W.

Vor allem II, S. 148 ff. In seinen ethnologischen Schriften arbeitet Cunow nicht mit dem Begriff der Produktionsweise. Vgl. etwa: Die Verwandtschaftsorganisation der Australneger, Stuttgart 1894. Die soziale Verfassung des Inkareichs. Stuttgart 1896. (Hier wird zwar die agrikole Produktionsweise der Inkagesellschaft beschrieben, aber erst im 5. Kapitel, S. 72 ff. und ohne den Versuch einer Ableitung der gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse aus der Produktionsweise.) Ähnlich auch: Ursprung der Religion und des Gottesglaubens, Berlin 1913. Von der Produktionsweise der Gruppen und Stämme, die Cunow auf ihre religiösen Vorstellungen hin untersucht, ist stets nur nebenbei, wenn überhaupt die Rede. Sehr viel stärker hebt Cunow die Naturbeziehungen als Grundlage wirtschaftlicher Entwicklung hervor in seiner Allgemeinen Wirtschaftsgeschichte. I—III, Berlin 1926 ff.; freilich nur für das Wirtschaftsleben der Primitiven. Auch hier folgt er jedoch nicht den Marxschen Kategorien, was zur Folge hat, daß selbst da, wo der das Naturmoment berücksichtigt, dies in einer chaotischen Weise geschieht, nicht viel anders, als die alten geographischen Materialisten es, soweit sie das Wirtschaftliche heranzogen, auch getan haben. So stellt Cunow die Frage nach dem Warum der Stagnation der Australneger überhaupt nicht (I, S. 77 ff.). Bei Behandlung der Jägervölker Nordamerikas sieht er nur ihren Reichtum an L e b e n s mitteln (I, S. 169 ff. und 227 ff.). Die von Marx sofort mitgestellte Frage nach den natürlichen Grundlagen der A r b e i t s mittel — hier: Steine, im Gegensatz zu Südamerika — gliedert er seiner Fragestellung nicht ein. Ganz im Sinne der alten geographischen Materialisten tritt bei Cunow bei der Untersuchung höherer Gesellschaftsformen das Problem der Naturgrundlage ihrer Entwicklung mehr und mehr zurück. Bei der Perukultur wird die Erwähnung der Naturgrundlagen der Bewässerungswirtschaft und die Schilderung dieser Wirtschaft selbst der Darstellung der sozialen Ordnung — der Mark — angehängt (I, S. 293 ff.). Bei Analyse der römischen Agrarentwicklung, einschließlich der Sklavenlandwirtschaft, bei Untersuchung der altindischen Agrarverhältnisse oder bei Beschreibung der industriellen Entwicklung Englands ist von den Naturgrundlagen so gut wie gar nicht mehr die Rede (II, S. 56, 27 ff., 32; III, S. 449, 472, 479). Im Falle England führt dieses sein Verfahren Cunow zu handgreiflichen Ungenauigkeiten, im Falle Indien zu einer völligen Fehlanalyse. <a href="#fnref:18" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:19"> <p>K.

Einer klaren Stellungnahme zu den entscheidenden Thesen Marxens wird in beiden Fällen aus dem Wege gegangen. Daß Kautsky im Grunde der Meinung war, Marxens Auffassung sei eine technizistische, läßt sich aus dem Umstände schließen, daß er in seinem Vorwort zu Gorters Schrift über den historischen Materialismus (deutsch, Stuttgart 1919) mit keinem Worte gegen Gorters technizistische Darstellung des historischen Materialismus Verwahrung einlegt. Gegen die Gleichsetzung von Produktionsweise und Technik, wie sie sich bei Gorter findet, hat Cunow mit Recht Einspruch erhoben (a. a. O.

O. S. 133). Nebensätze solcher Art sind nun gewiß sehr bezeichnend dafür, daß ein Theoretiker die Unrichtigkeit seiner Position fühlt, doch genügen sie natürlich nicht, die in den Hauptsätzen aufgestellte, den ganzen Gedankengang tragende falsche technizistische These aufzuheben. <a href="#fnref:53" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:54"> <p>Kautsky a. a.

Auch wenn die Zähnung des Feuers nicht unmittelbar aus dem Produktionsprozeß hervorgewachsen sein sollte, wie das die Kuhnsche Theorie annahm, bleibt die Tatsache bestehen, daß das Feuer erst auf einer ganz bestimmten Stufe der gesellschaftlichen Produktion für den Menschen aktuell geworden ist.

Die Kultur ist Naturfreiheit nicht im Sinne der völligen Loslösung, sondern in dem der vielfältigen weiteren und breiteren Verbindung . . . Wir werden nicht von der Natur im ganzen freier, indem wir sie eingehender ausbeuten ud studieren, wir machen uns nur von einzelnen Zufällen vervielfältigen” (Anthropogeographie, 4. Aufl. Stuttgart 1921, I, S. 41). Unsere hier bekundete Übereinstemmuing mit einem Gedanken Ratzels schließt eine kirtische Stellungnahme zu seinem geschichtsphilosphischen Gesamtsystem nicht aus (Vgl.

This piece is about the limits of that theory and their implications for contemporary critical theory.<d-footnote>For an excellent survey of many of the compelling aspects of racket theory, see the other pieces in this dossier.</d-footnote> These limits have to do with Adorno and Horkheimer’s reliance on what John Milios and Dmitri Sotiropoulos describe as “a ‘microeconomic’ approach according to which the characteristics of the ‘dominant form’ of enterprise (individual capital) shape the whole capitalist system (the social capital), determining its patterns of evolutionary change.”<d-footnote>Milios and Sotiropoulos, *Rethinking Imperialism: A Study of Capitalist Rule* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), 116.</d-footnote><br/> Milios and Sotiropoulos trace this approach back to Rudolph Hilferding’s <em>Finance Capital</em> and contrast it with Marx’s “macroeconomic” approach in the third volume of <em>Capital</em>, which centers on the concept of social capital<em>.</em><d-footnote>Ibid</d-footnote> Although I find the overall argument of their study on imperialism lacking (in ways that can’t be gone into right now because of space), I still find this critique of the “microeconomic” approach to be extremely valuable, if only as a negative methodological principle that warns us against some of the pitfalls that ensnared a number of otherwise insightful Marxist thinkers, including Adorno and Horkheimer.<d-footnote>A few examples include Lenin (at times), Kautsky, Bukharin, and the Monopoly Capital school, especially Baran &amp; Sweezy, but, as Harvey points out, it remains an aporia in Braverman as well; David Harvey, *The Limits to Capital*, new and fully updated edition (Verso, 2006), 142 n.2.</d-footnote></p> <p>Let us begin by looking at a paradigmatic example of the “microeconomic” approach from Adorno’s “Reflections on Class Theory” before turning to Milios and Sotiropoulos’ reconstruction of Marx’s arguments in volume III of <em>Capital</em> and examining their implications. In section V of that essay, Adorno elaborates what would become the economic core of racket theory for the first generation of Frankfurt School critical theorists:<d-footnote>See J.E. Morain’s piece in this dossier, where he describes it as the second essential thesis of the racket theory problematic. </d-footnote></p> <blockquote> <p>In the market economy the untrue aspect of the concept of class was latent: in monopoly capitalism it has become as visible as its truth – the survival of classes – has become invisible. Competition and its struggles have led to the disappearance of much of the unity of the class,which previously held the competitors together in the form of the rules of the game and of common interests. It is so easy for the bourgeoisie to deny its own class character to the<br/> proletariat because in fact its organization has cast off the consensual form of like interests that had constituted it as a class in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has replaced this with the direct economic and political command of the large capitalists that used the same threat of the police against both their own supporters and the workers. This imposes on both sections of the population the same function and the same need, and it is this that makes it almost impossible for the workers to see that class relations are at work.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942) in *Can One Live After Auschwitz? A Philosophical Reader*, ed. Rolf Tiedemann (Stanford University Press, 2003)</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>This passage shows a number of characteristic features of the “microeconomic” approach critiqued by Milios and Sotiropoulos including:</p> <ol> <li>The temporal and conceptual division between “the market economy” and “monopoly capitalism,” which hinges on changes in the dominant form of enterprise to characterize the poles of its opposition.</li> <li>The claim that the competition of the market economy period has led to the disappearance of the previous unity of the bourgeois class, which took the form of rules of the game and common interests, and its implicit suggestion that there has been a fundamental change in the structural determinations or “laws” of the capitalist mode of production as a result of the above changes.</li> <li>The claim that this previous form of unity has been replaced by “the direct economic and political command of the large capitalists,” which further suggests that this postulated change involves the displacement of competition from the central role it had in Marx’s account as the primary form of appearance through which those structural determinations manifest themselves.</li> </ol> <p>These are the very features of a “micro-economic” approach that Milios and Sotiropoulos set out to discredit in Chapter 6 of their book <em>Rethinking Imperialism</em> by reconstructing the relevant arguments from volume III of <em>Capital</em>.<d-footnote>See Milios &amp; Sotiropoulos, *Rethinking Imperialism*, 115-120.</d-footnote> The most important point from that chapter is the recovery of Marx’s concept of social capital and its relation to competition. The authors show how, for Marx, it is competition that constitutes the various individual capitals existing within a social formation as parts of the total social capital through the formation of an average rate of profit. This is how the capitalist class is united as a class and how the unique structural determinations or “inner laws” that define the capitalist mode of production are made manifest. Therefore, the displacement of competition from its central position in regulating economic life would mean the elimination of the mechanism through which those determinations are realized, and so of the determinations as a whole, rather than just their transformation. It would mean an end to the capitalist mode of production as such, and thus also to the usefulness of Marx’s analysis of it.<d-footnote>Another way to think about this in terms of Adorno’s claim about the replacement of the former “rules of the game” by “direct economic and political command,” which would mean an end to the indirect forms of domination that distinguish capitalism from previous modes of production and discipline capitalists into acting as bearers of the capital relation.</d-footnote></p> <p>What does all this mean for racket theory? On the one hand, it seems clear to me that many of the phenomena Adorno and Horkheimer are trying to explain in terms of the rise of monopolies and the supposed elimination of competition that accompanies it—the increasing preponderance of relations of direct coercion reminiscent of pre-capitalist social relations, the decline of bourgeois individuality and the subjective autonomy that characterized it, the increasing integration of organized labor, and the working class more broadly, into the hierarchical organization of capitalist social forms—are real changes that require explanation. It also seems clear that key elements of their explanation—the changing character of the dominant form of capitalist enterprise, changes in the way competition is organized that entail, at the very least, a relative diminution of its prominence in a number of areas—also track real changes in the configuration of capitalist social relations during the 20th century. On the other hand, the intervention of Milios and Sotiropoulos leads me to conclude that those explanatory elements are themselves phenomena to be explained, and that this explanation must begin from the other direction, from the concept of social capital and its relation to the constitution of an average rate of profit out of intra and inter-sectoral competition (nationally and globally). I think many of the explanations offered by Adorno and Horkheimer will still be valuable to us as we move down from this level of abstraction, but they will also need to be reevaluated and reconfigured in the process.</p> <p>This means not only working out the intermediate mediations between the abstract level of social capital brought into focus by Milios and Sotiropoulos and the more concrete levels worked out by Adorno and Horkheimer, but also clarifying some of the questions left open by the austerity of the formers’ abstraction—questions surrounding the dialectical interplay between the competition (or relative lack thereof) at work in the formation of a sectoral average rate of profit and the competition involved in the formation of an inter-sectoral average rate of profit, how these play out differentially on the national and the world markets, and how they relate to the play of tendency and counter-tendency surrounding the organic composition of capital and the “circumstances which, independently of the proportional division of surplus value into capital and revenue, determine the extent of accumulation.”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Capital: A Critique of Political Economy*, vol. I, trans. Ben Fowkes (Penguin Classics, 1990), 747-761.</d-footnote> I could even see the development of a renewed monopoly capital framework as the outcome of this work, but one which is at once more structural and more dialectical, centered on the <em>tendency</em> towards the elimination of competition at a sectoral level and the way in which this very tendency gives birth to new and renewed competition in other areas, before itself succumbing to the forces of intra-sectoral competition in the sector(s) of its origin and shifting locations (but not losing its overall force as a tendency), although this remains only a possibility until the necessary work is done.<d-footnote>David Harvey’s analysis in *The Limits to Capital*, in particular in Chapter 5, “The Changing Organization of Capitalist Production,” where he develops a concept of an "equilibrium between the tendencies toward centralization and decentralization” may be useful in this regard, although his neglect of the concept of social capital and consequent underdevelopment of the role that the dialectical interaction of intra- and inter-sectoral competition play in the phenomena he analyzes would need to be corrected; Harvey, *The Limits to Capital*, 137-155.</d-footnote> We must return to Marx—to all three volumes of <em>Capital</em>—with these questions in mind, and at the same time we must turn to the working out of these dynamics at the level of class struggle in concrete contemporary social formations, a turn which remains a perpetual promissory note in the analysis of Milios and Sotiropoulos.<d-footnote>Alongside the problems mentioned here, Milios and Sotiropoulos’ analysis also runs into a number of other problems surrounding their methodological nationalism that are too complicated to get into here.

These gangs primarily consisted of a network of variegated criminals organized in a strict, paramilitary hierarchy.<d-footnote>James Schmidt, “‘Racket,’ ‘Monopoly,’ and the Dialectic of Enlightenment,” *Persistent Enlightenment*, January 2016; Andrew W. Cohen, “The Racketeer’s Progress: Commerce, Crime, and the Law in Chicaǵo, 1900-1940,” Journal of Urban History 29, no. 5 (July 2003): 575–96; Edward Granter, “Strictly Business: Critical Theory and the Society of Rackets,” Competition &amp; Change 21, no. 2 (April 2017): 94–113; Robert M. Lombardo, Organized Crime in Chicago: Beyond the Mafia, (University of Illinois Press, 2012), 149–167.</d-footnote> Through the efforts of anti-union propagandists, these terms came to be associated with (radical) union officials during the New Deal era, an attempt to hinder the extra-legal, “criminal” activities undertaken by unions for collective action.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> In this context, Kirchheimer points out that lawyers used to frame “racket” as the “monopolistic practices […] carried through by physical force” for “singling out particularly objectionable methods serves as a convenient tool for bringing the guilty to account and depriving them of the sympathies of the community at large”<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 159.</d-footnote> against who are deemed miscreants or criminals. In a critical re-appropriation of the term, Horkheimer generalizes the concept of the racket to encompass most groups with vested interests in the social reproduction of monopoly capitalism insofar as they directly or indirectly rely on personal domination and violence to sustain themselves. The <em>civilized</em> ruling class is revealed to have always consisted of various rackets, hidden in plain sight through its control over production and disciplinary mechanisms, unlike the racket of the criminal that represented “more irrational, more primitive racket relative to the state-protected class monopoly.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Theorie des Verbrechers” [1939-1942] in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 270</d-footnote> Hence, Kirchheimer points out that</p> <blockquote> <p>if there is a difference in methods as between”haves” and “have-nots,” firstcomers and latecomers, “decent citizens” and “racketeers,” there is no difference in their aims which are essentially the same: establishment of domination over a segment of the process of production or distribution.<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 130.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In a letter to Franz Neumann, Horkheimer posits that (unlike the civilized rackets) the petty criminal skips over the “stage of production and seeks to appropriate to himself as much of the circulating surplus value as possible,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Theorie des Verbrechers” [1939-1942] in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 269</d-footnote> the criminal is an affront to the false universality of capitalist society who doesn’t keep up appearances, hence questions the very essence of capitalism. The criminal is disciplined through punishment to internalize the norms of society as more subtle institutions of socialization failed to do its job.<d-footnote>Michel Foucault argues a similar point in *Discipline and Punish*. The early critical theorists recognize the non-identity between the goals of these institutions and the embodied individual that cannot be fully socialized as an object. There is room for mediated agency in their conception.</d-footnote> In stark resemblance to Pashukanis’ argument regarding the legal form, Horkheimer observes that legal domination acquires its own logic immanent to capitalist social relations; unlike primitive sanctions or feudal punishment, the criminal as ordained by the legal form “is the exponent of a conflict necessarily inherent in society itself.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Theorie des Verbrechers” [1939-1942] in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 266</d-footnote> Criminal law shields the ruling rackets from the excesses that are generated by capitalist society, as those who cannot adapt to existing conditions lash out against those who benefit the most. The existing conditions that crush and exclude those who fail to keep up with its demands is rationalized in society by the “halo of necessity.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and The Family,” 93.</d-footnote> Poverty and crime are hypostatized as a natural part of any society, and the idea that ‘some people will always be poor or bad’ is instilled to <em>civilized</em> citizens through the universalization of the legal form and its constitutive ideological apparatuses. The legal institution becomes a tool of the ruling rackets in monopoly society to exert violence on the individuals and expand its horizons; the ruling class as rackets “make use of their productive apparatus as robbers make use of their guns.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> <p>With monopoly capitalism, the combination of the rise of the relative surplus population with furthering integration of the circuits of capital into social life led to the development of “antagonisms within the ranks of the oppressed masses themselves.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Rather than forming a class united by shared oppression/exploitation, the workers and the excluded are incentivized to form antagonistic groups within themselves (as rackets) as a response to the monopolistic organization of society—hierarchically organized and self-interested groups attempt to gain as much of the available social surplus through direct domination and violence directed towards other groups, regardless of their social position. The intra-class conflict of rackets within the ruling class is universalized under the antagonistic conditions of integration and exclusion, the employed section of the workers (in the global north) and their hierarchical trade unions, for Adorno (and Horkheimer), “became monopolies” that “terrorized outsiders” to secure their relative position.<d-footnote>Adorno, *“*Reflections on Class Theory,” 100.</d-footnote> The labour aristocracy is reframed as racket.<d-footnote>In letters to Horkheimer, Franz Neumann and Herbert Marcuse pushed back against the argument that the working class has fully adapted to the monopolistic structures of society. Neumann in particular responds that only labour leaders (as managers) have been integrated into racket logic. For Horkheimer, however, the working class constitutes a conscious class rather than a racket only when it shares collective agency. (See Neumann’s letter to Horkheimer in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 17, 482-483.) In one draft of the “Sociology of Class Relations”, Horkheimer incorporates the criticism by adding the paragraph but ultimately removes it — “There are some decisive differences between Labor and capitalistic monopolies(…)The term Labor, however, comprises both the leaders who appropriate the profits and the members who create them. The same process which, both in reality and ideology, has made Labor an economic subject, has transformed the laborer, who was already the object of the entrepreneur, into the object of his organization as well(…) While the masses think of themselves as the creators of their own destiny, the leaders use them as a commodity. The fact that Labor is a monopoly does not mean that its members, labor aristocracy excepted, are monopolists.” (Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”)</d-footnote> The revolutionary working class struggle is replaced by hierarchical labour organizations that trade labour as a “merchandise, manipulate it, advertise it, and try to fix its price as high as possible.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> With hindsight, we can observe that even these labour organizations in the global north have been largely disintegrated with the total expansion of market rationality throughout the world. Rackets appear not as part of the integration of working class organizations as it did during the 40s but as the result of exclusion and pauperization that accompanies capitalist integration. The anti-Democratic reactionary movements appearing the across the world such as MAGA, and the militant Hindu religious movements in India are accompanied by the rise of surplus populations being appropriated by the ruling rackets, the “criminal” that previously aroused the spirits of ruling classes by attempting to mimic their actions is a tool to be instrumentally used and subsequently discarded.<d-footnote>In a letter to Horkheimer, Marcuse explicitly writes about the “harmony of interests between the union bureaucracy and the large monopolistic companies” and the “in some striking cases, the collaborationist attitude of the workers seems to be even stronger than that of the unions.” During the 1930’s lead to the “the famous Jack and Heintz factory in Cleveland (good article on it in the New Republic of Oct. 25), which is praised (also by the Communist Party) as paragon of the true relationships between workers. It is perhaps the most outstanding example of voluntary coordination of labor, and it shows how smoothly fascism can progress in a democratic environment.” (See Marcuse’s letter to Horkheimer in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 17, 476-477.)</d-footnote> Kirchheimer writes</p> <blockquote> <p>Racket connotes a society in which individuals have lost the belief that compensation for their individual efforts will result from the mere functioning of impersonal market agencies. But it keeps in equal distance from, and does not incorporate, the idea of a society wherein the antagonism between men and inanimate elements of production has been dissolved in the image of a free association for the common use of productive forces. It is the experience of an associational practice which implies that neither the individual’s choice of an association nor the aims that the latter pursues are the result of conscious acts belonging to the realm of human freedom.<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 161.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Society tends towards the formation of competing “pressure” groups as rackets that does not hesitate to use any means necessary to carve out a space for its own reproduction through the acquisition of the circulating surplus value as an adaptation to the conditions of monopolization. The intensification of the impersonal forms of control characteristic of capitalist society through the market and the legal form in-turn intensifies the forms of personal domination that highlighted pre-capitalist social organizations, traditional forms of domination such as caste are explicitly mobilized as rackets to navigate class society. Horkheimer claims the primary function of groups is to protect itself from outside aggression, and stabilize its own social position in society. Hence groups themselves maintain the conditions of social reproduction “in which they have favored standing; they uphold and violently ward off changes that could endanger their monopoly. They are rackets.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist” in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 288</d-footnote> Durkheim’s false distinction between organic and mechanical solidarity collapses in-itself through racket logic, the division of labour organized through vast interconnected networks throughout society is maintained through personal relationships of domination in-and-between groups. What was purportedly in conflict with the forces of capitalism according to liberals was absorbed by capitalism for its continual expansion. As Horkheimer writes</p> <blockquote> <p>“Today the expression of human needs is distorted no longer by the dubious economic indicators of the market, but by their conscious molding in a giant system of socio-psychological surgery. The misery of unsuccessful competitors and of backward groups can no longer be ascribed to anonymous processes which permitted a distinction between them as economic subjects and as human beings. The downfall of vanquished opponents, competitors as well as whole social strata, minorities and nations, is decided upon by the elites.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>The elite theory of Vilfredo Pareto is reframed as racket formation particular to specific social conditions rather than the transhistorical determination of power relations as such. For the early critical theorists, elite sociology partially describes the social dynamics within modern society but fails to understand its causes, which leads to its reactionary conclusions.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, *Introduction to Sociology*, ed. Christoph Gödde, tr. Edmund Jephcott (Stanford University Press), 13–14.</d-footnote> The partial description of elites circulating at the top throughout history as democracies are eventually reduced to oligarchies are rather the descriptions of rackets competing amongst themselves for resources while imposing strict control over their subjects. Unlike Pareto’s transhistorical formulation of the relations of power, the concept of the racket leaves the possibility of a truly free and democratic society open through the dissolution of rackets through the formation of a political class.</p> <p>As James Schmidt points out, the language of rackets and monopoly were tactically removed from manuscripts that were eventually published as the <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> to escape censorship by American authorities. They resorted to an esoteric mode of communication to develop an immanent critique of enlightenment rationality as it arises with the development of capitalism, it is particularly illuminating to understand the concepts introduced in the <em>Dialectic</em> to understand the functioning of class domination, misogyny and racism in monopoly society.<d-footnote>Schmidt, “‘Racket,’ ‘Monopoly,’ and the Dialectic of Enlightenment,” and Eva-Maria Ziege, “The Irrationality of the Rational : The Frankfurt School and Its Theory of Society in the 1940s,” in *Antisemitism and the Constitution of Sociology* (University of Nebraska Press, 2014), 274–96.)</d-footnote> Their primary thesis that enlightenment and myth are deeply interrelated with enlightenment rationality (with the transition to capitalism) leading to a blind domination over nature, alongside the explicit integration of tradition with capitalism.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Fascism was the result of identification with the blind forces of the economic apparatus.</p> <p>Adorno and Horkheimer understand the return of mimesis in modernity as an adaptive response to the conditions of total integration of Capitalism with the domination of nature and eventually humanity.<d-footnote>Theodor W Adorno and Max Horkheimer, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, 2016, 148.</d-footnote> The impersonal forces of capitalism i.e. the dominance of the market and the formal equality of the legal form, which leads to identification with the inert functioning of the world with itself. For Freud, the death drive is the attempt to conquer (qua mastery over) death through a constant repetition of the actions that brings the individuals close to an inorganic state, a drive to kill a part of oneself and identify with the external functioning world to conquer death itself.<d-footnote>Sigmund Freud, *Beyond the Pleasure Principle: Group Psychology and Other Works ; (1920-1922)*, 38–55.</d-footnote> Like the death drive, mimicry in capitalism is an irrational repetition to control the irrationality of existing reality, hence</p> <blockquote> <p>“By echoing, repeating, imitating the surroundings, by adapting himself to all the powerful groups to which he belongs, by transforming himself from a human being into a member of specific organized bodies, by reducing his potentialities to readiness and ability to conform to, and gain influence in, such bodies, he can finally manage to survive. It is survival by practicing the oldest biological means of survival: mimicry. Modern culture is a resurrection of oppressed mimetic practices.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Apropos mimesis, Rackets are “pragmatic totalities,” hierarchical organizations that are pragmatically oriented towards the existing world that hypostatizes the existing conditions of social reproduction. Pragmatism, both in its commonsensical and philosophical sense “corresponds to limitless trust in the existing world” <d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, ed., “On the Problem of Truth,” in *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, 192.</d-footnote> Elderly advice and the realism of international politics amounts to the same things—anything that challenges the current state of affairs is deemed as a childish tantrum that fails to understand reality. For Horkheimer, the masses understand their own economic situation but that (immediately) does not translate into revolutionary class consciousness but is sublimated into the blind acceptance of existing reality as pragmatic/realist decision making. The philosophy of pragmatism of William James and John Dewey as its primary representatives limits the conception to truth to corroboration of ideas with use, it ends with reifying concepts for their usefulness as posited by the existing state of affairs.<d-footnote>Ibid, 195.</d-footnote> The convergence of philosophical thinking and the rationality of groups as pragmatic totalities is a mimetic response to the impersonal forces of the market. For Adorno, this limitless trust qua pragmatism leads to the flattening of everything to easily identifiable and measurable categories, all art (qua commodities) starts to resemble each other. Genuine differences are eliminated through the dream of eventually joining the ruling rackets.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory”, 96. Similarly Horkheimer write about this in the context of Caste Society: “The terrible differentiation in ways of work and life, which enables the Indian life-process to succeed, was rendered intelligible by the idea of the transmigration of souls, according to which birth into an upper or lower caste is the consequence of actions in an earlier life. The lowest classes find in this idea a special reason for not wanting any change in the system. In so far as a Pariah can say that he is faithful to the prescriptions for his caste, he hopes that in his next birth he will rise into the Brahman caste and enjoy its privileges.” (Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 63)</d-footnote> Adorno writes,</p> <blockquote> <p>“the prisoners of the system, strive to bring about this leveling by imitating their stunted rulers in the hope of receiving a pittance in their old age, if only they can prove themselves worthy. The belief that they might be able to form an organized class and conduct a class war crumbles in the minds of the dispossessed along with liberal illusions.”<d-footnote>Adorno, *“*Reflections on Class Theory”, 96.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Unlike the pragmatists, the objective of materialism (according to the early critical theorists) was to demonstrate that corroboration between ideas and reality qua the notion of use is itself a “historical occurrence” that arises in definite social relations. To demystify the concepts of realism that are taken as granted.</p> <p>For instance, the so-called “natural” facts of human society such as a family are reframed as a hierarchical racket with the figure of the father at the top. The family that serves to socialize children into existing conditions through discipline and punishment, the child integrates herself the conditions of domination within the family unit through a memetic response, “submission to the categorical imperative of duty has been from the beginning a conscious goal of the bourgeois family.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family”, 99.</d-footnote> The family qua racket is cemented as the primary conservative force in society that compels a sense of economic and social responsibility for the wife and children dependent on the husband’s reliance on a wage. Rebellion against the family and the patriarchal system is conceptualized as abandonment/disloyalty to one’s own group, domination is sublimated into the very consciousness of a person.<d-footnote>Ibid, 120,</d-footnote> Similarly, official legal titles are certifications that signify belonging to a racket through the state apropos the legal form. Individuals are <em>integrated</em> into the system through the process of certification, “legal and illegal titles […] are distinguished by the fact that the world has an all-embracing organization; none should escape its protection; if proscribed by its agencies, one is forsaken.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist” in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 289.</d-footnote></p> <p>In the outline for a planned book on rackets, Horkheimer writes, “The fact that history is a history of class struggles means that history is a history of rackets fighting among themselves and against the rest of society.”<d-footnote>Typescript “Notizen zum Programm des Buches, 3.8.1942,” Max Horkheimer Nachlass XI.10.1 https://arcinsys.hessen.de/arcinsys/detailAction.action?detailid=v3007298. Adorno similarly writes, “In the image of the latest economic phase, history is the history of monopolies. In the image of the manifest act of usurpation that is practiced nowadays by the leaders of capital and labor acting in consort, it is the history of gang wars and rackets.” Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 100.</d-footnote> The concept of racket applied in history reveals the logic of domination immanent in class society that shackles the individual within groups, that in times of crisis results in a rapid unleashing of irrational destruction and violence. Under the limits imposed by class society, individuals are forced to integrate themselves into groups that will rule over groups below them—The oppressed become the oppressors of “those further down” the hierarchy.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Liberalism based on the idea of social contract between individuals in the <em>state of nature</em>, that will render individuals free from domination failed to fulfill its promise. Traditional forms of domination and rule that were understood as <em>inadequate</em> to liberalism was instead integrated into the economic apparatus, “by abolishing the classes in this way, class rule comes into its own.”<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 100.</d-footnote> For the IfS, only through the establishment of a rationally organized society that with the association of free individuals<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Traditional and Critical Theory” in *Critical theory*, 218.</d-footnote> by a conscious working class struggle will lead to the unfolding of genuine democracy and freedom.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In a letter to Horkheimer, Kirchheimer states that as ideology of existing conditions has deeply steeped into consciousness—it has been accompanied by a distrust of theory, rise in conspiratorial thinking, and explicitly anti-scientific sentiment. Ideology has “withdrawn from psychology into the anthropological fundament,”<d-footnote>See Neumann’s letter to Horkheimer in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 17, 482-483.</d-footnote> which calls for a “materialist anthropology” to understand and supplant existing conditions.</p> <p>The IfS had been writing during monopoly capitalism with authoritarian state presence throughout society apropos cold war liberalism, fascism and state socialism. Which starkly resembles neo-liberalism apropos the identity between unfettered market forces and state of today. Sociology of the racket provides us the framework to better understand the mutually interlocking relationship between reactionary organizations, class structure of a society with expansion of the informal economy and the democratic backsliding seen throughout the contemporary world—for instance the relationship between the state, big business, and militant Hindutva groups in India could be understood as composed of mutually interlocking rackets arising with large scale monopolization and decreasing economic stability. It provides a valuable research program to investigate our contemporary world.</p> <p>Horkheimer writes about how initiation rituals of tribes could be understood as integration into rackets, the ritual signifying the socialization of an individual into group norms against the world.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The sociology of the racket also shows the possibility of genuine freedom and democracy that can imagine a racket-free society made up of freely associating producers. The utopian potential of a liberated society, even at the darkest of time, even with total integration of everyone into an irrational society, the future remains open with possibilities through the very conditions of existing society. As Adorno writes,</p> <blockquote> <p>In reified human beings reification finds its outer limits. They catch up with the technical forces of production in which the relations of production lie hidden: in this way these relations lose the shock of their alien nature because the alienation is so complete. But they may soon also lose their power. Only when the victims completely assume the features of the ruling civilization will they be capable of wresting them from the dominant power. The only remaining differentiating factor is reduced to naked usurpation. Only in its blind anonymity could the economy appear as fate: its spell is broken by the horror of the seeing dictatorship. The mimicking of the classless society by class society has been so successful that, while the oppressed have all been co-opted, the futility of all oppression becomes manifest. The ancient myth proves to be quite feeble in its new omnipotence. Even if the dynamic at work was always the same, its end today is not the end.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 110.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Racket society produces its own antinomy with the formation of anti-racket political and artistic units with “with [their points] directed upwards”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist.”</d-footnote> that aim to abolish racket society through the formation of a political class of the exploited and subordinated.</p>]]></content><author><name>Re Tejus</name></author><category term="Racketology"/><category term="report"/><category term="write-up"/><category term="study"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part 2 on the Frankfurt School's racket concept]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introducing Racket Theory</title><link href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing Racket Theory"/><published>2025-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post27-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post27-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post27-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post27.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br/></p> <p>The texts collected here belong to the materials on ‘racket theory’ composed by members of the Institute for Social Research between 1941 and 1944.

We have found it helpful to divide our subsequent analysis of the racket theory project into three major sections, which are not exclusive in terms of content. Our narrative starts with the earliest use of the term in Max Horkheimer’s essay “The End of Reason” (1942). After this, we turn to analyzing the stream of texts which were explicitly composed for or about publication(s), mostly written between spring 1942 and fall 1943.

Finally, we briefly discuss some particularities of the core racket theory texts before concluding.

The remaining members of the Institute—specifically Horkheimer, Adorno, Löwenthal, and Paul Massing—would return to the more general problematic of ‘authority’ and ‘authoritarianism’ in the late 1940s with the <em>Studies in Prejudice</em> series that Horkheimer edited with Samuel Flowerman for the American Jewish Committee, and especially in <em>The Authoritarian Personality</em> (1950), where Adorno would build off of the same Frommian concept of the authoritarian character structure that grounded the 1936 <em>Studien</em>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p> <p>Horkheimer’s essays “The Jews and Europe” (1939) and “Authoritarian State” (1940) were also important precursors to the racket theory project. These two essays touch on many themes that would reappear a few years later in the racket theory corpus: fundamental commonalities between fascism and liberal capitalism, the decline of law and return of direct domination, the worthlessness of reformism, etc. The essential difference between these essays and the racket theory corpus is the absence of any unifying concept in the former. From 1942, the concept of the racket would quickly come to fill this role in both their short- and long-form reflections on economics and politics. It would serve as the term mediating between their presentation of the constant of impersonal domination in capitalist society as a totality and the variable forms of more personal or direct domination through which the former increasingly found expression in the everyday lives of the subjects of late capitalism.</p> <p>The story of the racket concept in particular begins with the final issue of the Institute for Social Research’s official journal, <em>Studies in Philosophy and Social Science</em>—the short-lived (1939-1942) English-language successor to their <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> (1932-1939)—in Summer 1941, which has retrospectively become known as the “State Capitalism” issue (Nos. 2 and 3 of Vol. IX), named after the central idea of Friedrich Pollock’s two controversial contributions: “State Capitalism: Its Possibilities and Limitations” and “Is National Socialism a New Order?” Though Horkheimer and Adorno’s work from this period has traditionally been interpreted as an extension of Pollock’s state capitalism thesis, such readings almost entirely ignore the substantial critiques both Horkheimer and Adorno level against Pollock’s theory—largely in agreement with the better-known critiques of Neumann and Kirchheimer—in the ensuing debate over whether the Institute should publish the text at all.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> This confrontation with Pollock’s theory was a crucial ingredient in the development of the racket theory project.</p> <p>The final issue of <em>Studies</em> opens with Horkheimer’s essay “The End of Reason,” which was written in close collaboration with Adorno. In the Horkheimer Archive, amidst the drafts for “End of Reason,” there are a number of excerpts, with unique handwritten corrections and notes for revision, from one section of the essay in particular under the title “Racket Theorie.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> This passage seems to have acquired a newfound, retrospective significance for Horkheimer and Adorno as they worked on the earliest drafts of the <em>Fragmente</em> in Spring and Summer 1942. The excerpt provides a provisional definition of the racket as a form of social domination—“[p]rotection is the archetype of domination”—after its violent historical reappearance in the transition from the “interlude” free market liberalism to monopoly capitalism: “Monopolism has […] led social domination back to its true nature which had continued to operate only where the humane form of domination had left some loopholes to inhumanity.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> The passage concludes with the earliest formulation of a research program devoted to the racket itself: “A study of such border phenomena as racketeering may offer useful parallels for understanding certain developmental tendencies in modern society.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> The apparent marginality of racketeering relative to the monopolistic planning of states is exactly what made the racket so promising as a model for the explanation of monopoly.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p> <h2 id="thwarted-plans-for-publication">Thwarted Plans for Publication</h2> <p>Prompted by internal debates opened during the composition and publication of the “State Capitalism” issue, Horkheimer prepared a memo (the “LA Memo”) in April 1942 about the ‘non-philosophical’ problems—many of them related to so-called state capitalism—that would have to be tackled in his planned book on dialectics, which would eventually become <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>. The word ‘racket’ only appears once in memo, indicating that it was not yet the focal concept for the planned work. A slightly earlier letter to Felix Weil from March of ‘42 related Horkheimer’s desire to recruit Weil as well as Friedrich Pollock (and perhaps Henryk Grossmann and Arkady Gurland) to assist with writing the sociological-economic part of the dialectics book.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p> <p>By the Summer of ‘42, Horkheimer and Adorno had begun work on what would become <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, and they were increasingly aware that an extended treatment of their new thinking about class, authority, and the economy would not fit in the ‘dialectics book.’ This was largely due to the fact that the theory of the racket was conceived from the beginning as a multidisciplinary project, something Horkheimer and Adorno could not accomplish without collaborators in political science, law, and economics. In August of ‘42, they—probably Adorno working on the basis of prior discussions with Horkheimer—produced another memo (“Notes for the Programme of the Book”) outlining their plans for an independent book on what they were now calling “racket theory”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> or “sociology of rackets.”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Inspired by this second memo, Adorno quickly drafted the essay “Reflections on Class Theory,” a text which he told Horkheimer could be “readily broken up and transferred to different places in the end product [i.e. the planned book] as needed.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p> <p>The rudimentary plan of these memos gestated into more concrete plans for a 1943 yearbook—presumably a continuation of or successor to <em>Studies in Philosophy and Social Science</em>—that would include contributions from the likes of Arkady Gurland, Herbert Marcuse, Franz Neumann, and Otto Kirchheimer. Kirchheimer’s contribution would be about “rackets in the labor movement” and “analyze the differences between industrial monopolies and the trade unions,” while Neumann would write “a study on the possibilities of political forms which do not have the character of rackets” and Gurland’s essay would deal with “certain statistical data with regard to the changes in the working classes.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Marcuse’s contribution was presumably to be the essay he was working on at the time, a study of “how new forms of control, manipulation, and behavior express themselves in the language of this age” entitled “Operational Thinking and Social Domination.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Horkheimer confided in Marcuse that he “[had] the feeling that the realization of this plan would be the first step toward giving [sic] a piece of Critical Theory which would not be purely philosophical.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>There were, however, some significant problems with this plan. As Thomas Wheatland has shown in <em>The</em> <em>Frankfurt School In Exile</em>, the Institute for Social Research’s affiliation with Columbia University, which facilitated the former’s emigration to the United States in 1934, was contingent on both the Institute’s financial autonomy and the continuation of their pre-existing social research using quantitative and empirical methods.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> With the Horkheimer circle’s bitter break with Erich Fromm, the leading empirical social researcher of the group, in 1939 and the Institute’s rapidly worsening financial situation, they had become incapable of fulfilling either of Columbia’s desiderata by the outbreak of WWII.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> In addition to recurrent suspicions towards the Institute core’s Marxist, or even communist, sympathies<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and an undisclosed quota system that limited the number of Jewish faculty members,<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> a more permanent affiliation between the Institute and Columbia’s sociology department was endangered by the latter’s internal disputes over its own direction and leadership between 1939 and 1942. After the Institute failed to secure a source of external funding for any of the ambitious group research projects it proposed in this period, Horkheimer, who had since moved to Los Angeles in Spring 1941, finally responded to Columbia’s reluctance to support the Institute beyond offering a teaching appointment to Franz Neumann in 1942 by making the decision to radically downsize the Institute in late 1942.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> The lack of any institutional affiliation meant that funding for the yearbook would be hard to come by.</p> <p>At the same time, several of the contributing authors—Marcuse, Neumann, and Kirchheimer—had recently obtained gainful employment at the Research &amp; Analysis branch of the United States Office of Strategic Services and would have little time to complete their projected contributions.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> On top of these two problems, one of the major planned contributors, Henryk Grossmann, found himself increasingly at odds with the inner circle of the Institute both theoretically and interpersonally.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Plans were quickly scaled back from a full-fledged yearbook to a smaller mimeographed edition,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> but even this apparently proved unfeasible. Otto Kirchheimer actually completed his essay and wound up getting “In Quest of Sovereignty” published in <em>The Journal of Politics</em> in May 1944 after it became clear that the Institute’s publication plans had come to naught. Marcuse would eventually repurpose some of his work from “Operational Thinking…” for <em>One Dimensional Man</em>.</p> <p>That’s as far as plans for publication in book form got, but Horkheimer also produced a series of fragments related to the racket idea and a substantial essay on the topic. While we know that Horkheimer started work on his fragments in 1942, the exact date is not entirely clear. The most likely possibility is that at least some of them were started in Spring or Summer 1942 and thus provided a rough conceptual basis for the subsequent racket theory texts. It is also unclear what exactly Horkheimer planned to do with these fragments: whether they were intended for publication or merely a means for internal theoretical edification or etc.</p> <p>In early 1943, Horkheimer began writing a more cohesive essay on racket theory, hoping against hope that he still might be able to produce the planned yearbook or at least find some outlet for the racket idea. The text received the deceptively unimaginative title “On the Sociology of Class Relations” and would only be published in full posthumously. Horkheimer sent out copies of an early draft to various Institute associates—Marcuse, Kirchheimer, and Neumann—for feedback in September 1943 and produced a finished draft on the basis of their feedback shortly afterwards. “Sociology of Class Relations” stands out as the most integrated and wide-ranging text in the entire racket theory corpus.</p> <p>Horkheimer continued to periodically revise the fragments with input from Adorno until Spring 1944, when they were all, with the sole exception of “On the Ideology of Politics Today,” compiled together in a staple-bound typed booklet (complete with a table of contents, pagination, and a prefatory note) under the title “Concepts as a Supplement to the Festschrift for Friedrich Pollock.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> As that title suggests, this compilation was a companion volume to the original <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em> version of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, which Horkheimer and Adorno had dedicated to their friend and collaborator Pollock on the occasion of his 50th birthday. The preface to the <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em> would also be the first and last time that “On the Sociology of Class Relations” was mentioned in print. Adorno and Horkheimer explained that the essay was excluded along with “all English works produced in the same period, regardless of their connection to the fragments,” but nevertheless belonged to the “whole work” which they “[hoped] to complete… in the not too distant future.”<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p> <p>After the limited ‘publication’ (so to speak) of the “Concepts” and the <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em>, Horkheimer and Adorno shelved the racket theory texts for a few years. They eventually returned to them in 1946-1947 while preparing the new edition of what was now titled <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> for publisher Querido and, slightly later, Horkheimer’s book <em>Eclipse of Reason</em>. Among the extensive changes they made to the text of <em>Dialectic</em> for the Querido edition, the fragment “Strafgefangene” (or “Prisoners”) from the “Concepts” was incorporated into the fragment “From ‘A Theory of the Criminal,’” itself a lengthy excerpt from the full “Theory of the Criminal” of the “Concepts.” Beyond this, none of the older, unpublished work was included.</p> <p>“On the Sociology of Class Relations” fared slightly better. In 1946, substantial sections of it were revised and repurposed for Chapter IV of Horkheimer’s <em>Eclipse of Reason</em>, “Rise and Decline of the Individual.”<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> Among the most radical of these revisions was the elimination of the concept of the “racket” from the text entirely.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> The publication of <em>Eclipse</em> marked the end of the Horkheimer and Adorno’s attempts to publish their writings on the racket from the early 1940s,<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> though not the end of their preoccupation with the problem of the disappearance of socialist internationalism with the ‘racketization’ of the labor movement.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p> <h2 id="the-reflexivity-of-racket-theory">The Reflexivity of Racket Theory</h2> <p>Much of the authoritative secondary literature on racket theory to date has approached these early sketches searching for some basic incoherence that is meant to explain why the project would ultimately remain unfinished.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> However, the points of incoherence often imputed to racket theory under the assumption of its necessary failure prove to be the same problems the critical theorists consciously adopted as their point of departure for the reflexive contextualization and construction of racket theory from the beginning.</p> <p>From its inception in “The End of Reason,” the concept of the racket has a paradoxical historical status: in the transition of modern capitalist society from “liberalism” to “monopolism,” the ‘archetype’ and ‘true nature’ of social domination that remains the condition of class society, i.e., ‘prehistory’ as a whole, is revealed.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> In each of their subsequent contributions to racket theory, Horkheimer and Adorno will contextualize their theoretical efforts both within the process of ‘racketization’ society undergoes in the transition from ‘liberal’ to ‘monopoly’ capitalism and in the ‘negative invariance’<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> of human prehistory as a whole. Closing his first thesis of his essay devoted to rackets, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942), Adorno formulates the historical discovery of prehistory in the language of the <em>Manifesto</em>: “All history is the history of class struggles because it was always the same thing, namely, prehistory.”<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> The last line of Horkheimer’s “On the Sociology of Class Relations” (1943) is a direct interpolation from Marx’s remarks on the method of political economy from the ‘Introduction’ to the <em>Grundrisse</em>: “the anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the ape.”<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> In a letter to Felix Weil from January 1943, Horkheimer explains: “The meaning of that truth is that once we know man, we can discover his beginnings in earlier forms of life. Once Fascism had developed in European society, we now are able to find its hallmarks in earlier stages of human history, but it would be an error to say that, because of those traces, the development was a necessary one.”<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> Throughout the fragments, the racket will appear under the dual aspect of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic,’ historical variable and prehistorical constant, according to this parallax. This accounts for the centrality of the problem of law in the sketches on racket theory, and more specifically on what Evgeny Pashukanis called “indissoluble internal connection between the categories of the economy based on the commodity and on money, and the legal form itself.”<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> For the subject of modern social domination is in the end neither the state as collective capitalist nor the conspiracy of the rackets, but “the unconscious colossus of real existence, subjectless capitalism, [which] inflicts its destruction blindly.”<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p> <p>In a pair of letters written in February 1943, Horkheimer is clear: the theoretical perspective required for racket theory is none other than the Marxian critique of political economy, which alone makes it possible for the social theorist to “to deprive liberalism of the weapon to think of itself as of the ‘natural’ economic system and to show up the identity of the meta-economic structure of both the present day collective and the old free market system.”<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> The twist, however, is that the Marxian theory of social totality becomes illegible in the fragmentation of the social sciences into a system of rackets this theory is needed to critique: “This is what the critique of political economy, which established dialectical relations between the totality of the social sciences, has become among these academic groups, a kind of dealing between the different rackets which confirm one another that they are indispensable.”<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> The same ‘racketization’ of society in the transition from free-market, ‘liberal’ capitalism to monopoly capitalism that underlies and drives the development of racket theory simultaneously undermines and frustrates the intelligibility of the theory itself. For Horkheimer and Adorno, the false modesty of epistemological pluralism which posits the <em>a priori</em> insurmountability of the division of labor in the sciences is as vicious as the pre-established harmony of the sciences was in the dogmatic philosophical systems of the past. The dispute unfolding within the social sciences between special-scientific pluralism and the renaissance of metaphysical holism is interpreted as a refractory expression of a generalized social crisis characterized by the simultaneous fragmentation and consolidation of political rackets. The lack of conscious coordination between the sciences is the reverse side of an unconscious agreement each has with the existing order of society. This reality became increasingly pressing for the racket theorists in the 1940s as they found themselves increasingly forced to seek funding from various government and non-profit ‘rackets’ whose patronage was conditional on the silence of critical theory towards the total mobilization of American society during WWII. The content of racket theory rebounds on its form.</p> <p>In a letter written in August, 1942, on the style of his collaborations with Adorno, Horkheimer writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>I’m far from imagining that our thought could “break through in America” … . We no longer hope for more than that, should the day finally break, what we’ve written will be but a small star, flickering, though barely visible, in the horrific night of the present. For what else should the gaze which stares into the fireworks of magazines and the other slick products of scientific and unscientific mass culture see when it turns away from it all if not darkness? … Any theses of ours, as the guiding principles of a successful publication, would at best only add a new shading of color to the bouquet of rockets.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The degree to which their stylistic experimentation during the composition of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> was influenced by their conception of the racket as a form of social domination has yet to be fully explored.</p> <h2 id="additional-remarks-on-the-texts-and-their-content">Additional Remarks on the Texts and their Content</h2> <p>As mentioned above, all of the fragments that we are translating and publishing here were all included in a booklet except for “On the Ideology of Politics Today.” Before discussing the content of the fragments from the “Concepts” compilation, some attention must be given to this particular fragment. While this fragment is incomplete—it breaks off mid-sentence—it still contains a particularly pointed criticism of Friedrich Pollock’s theory of state capitalism, one which has prompted previous interpreters to attempt—unsuccessfully, in our view—to direct the criticism away from Pollock himself.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p> <p>The five fragments from the “Concepts” that we selected for translation and publication are all closely related on a thematic level. In particular, they dedicate significant space to analyzing the conflicted relation between rackets and law—both concepts serving as synecdoches for specific forms of domination. The particularism of the racket is also its “fundamental illegality;”<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> it is the antithesis of the abstract, universal domination of law. Despite the apparent conflict between rackets and law, they are inseparably bound together in reality. The state’s justice is founded by and can only be administered by rackets; law in class society is “set in pre-established harmony with the rule of cliques which hold weapons and means of production.”<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> Its apparent universality is set up for the advantage of a particular class. The law has an elective affinity with money, commodities, and private property. In spite of the universal validity of both forms, the sanctions of law gravitate towards the poor in particular just as commoditized wealth goes to the rich. Thus rackets and law are in a chiasmic relation of speculative identity and non-identity: rackets found the law; law is foundered on rackets.</p> <p>The figure of the criminal holds a special place in this tortuous interplay of universal and particular. The criminal is punished for transgressing the universally binding restrictions that enable collective survival in the state—the so-called common good—in the interests of their own benefit. But, as Horkheimer argues, “[t]he enemy is never the object of punishment, for it is always administered to the defenseless.”<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> Thus, punishment does not follow the logic of self-defense taught by Hobbes: it is an impassioned act of revenge against someone already disarmed that reveals the “illegality of the law.”<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> Law constitutes itself as human society’s defense against nature, but behind this rationalistic alibi is the same cruelly natural fate it was supposed to prevent: painful death without reason.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup></p> <p>Another form of false universality and unity assumed by the racket is the fascist ‘collective’ or ‘community.’ Whatever internal unity such a formation possesses must be placed in the context of its violent competition with other ‘collectives’ and suppression of the outcasts unlucky enough to be excluded from the benefits of any racket. Of course, this aforementioned unity is also largely transient, if not entirely illusory. Such ‘collectives’ are invariably characterized by violently enforced internal hierarchies and struggle within each level of their hierarchy. The racketized form of collectivity is present also in the working class in the shape of the reformist unions and parties that narrowly seek after privileges for their members. This is not an inevitable result, but rather a betrayal—one that leads to the destruction of its all-too-clever perpetrator.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>Turning our attention to the two memos, we must recognize that these are somewhat special documents, as they were not intended for external promulgation. We have chosen to translate and publish them because they provide unique insight into the Frankfurt School’s racket theory project and their internal working process more generally.</p> <p>The “LA Memo” (“On parts of the Los Angeles work program that cannot be carried out by the philosophers”) is difficult to date exactly, but it is definitely from some point in April 1942. The document is of special interest because of its strikingly clear formulation of the sociological and economic problems motivating the Institute’s research at the time. The language used in the memo indicates that it dates to the period when Horkheimer and Adorno still believed that a treatment of racket theory could fit into the ‘dialectics book.’ The “Notes for the Programme of the Book,” dated August 20th, 1942, were accompanied by thirty sheets of “excerpts from texts on the history of rackets” (seemingly compiled by Adorno) from September 15th, 1942.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> These excerpts were mostly from works from or about Ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy that dealt with topics relevant to the themes of the racket theory project (political power, state violence, etc).</p> <p>Both of these internal documents show the Institute’s continued interest in synthetic interdisciplinary social research that would incorporate history, philosophy, economics, sociology, and psychoanalysis. It also indirectly shows the difficulties of such a project. The ambitious outline found in “Notes for the Programme of the Book” recalls the similarly ambitious 1934 plans for <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em>, plans which the Institute was still incapable of fulfilling then despite having more financial resources at their disposal as well as actual stable working relationships between all the major contributors.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p> <p><br/></p> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketTexts/">Read the Fragments and Texts on Racket Theory</a></p> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ClassRelations/">Read “On the Sociology of Class Relations”</a></p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <p><br/></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>See <a href="https://jamescrane.substack.com/i/161511932/translators-note-reconstructing-the-formation-of-the-encore">James Crane, “Translator’s note: Reconstructing the Formation of the <em>Encore</em>.” in <em>Substudies</em> (blog), 4/18/2025</a> <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>MHA Na 1 <a href="https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/horkheimer/content/titleinfo/5668657">639</a>, [39]-[218]. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Max Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family” [1936] in <em>Critical Theory: Selected Essays</em> (Continuum, 2002), 68-69. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>For more on Erich Fromm’s importance for the Freudo-Marxist ‘analytic social psychology’ of the early Frankfurt School, see J.

In a footnote, Noerr writes that “Zur Ideologie der Politik heute (Fragment),” […] reads like a critique of a positivistically abbreviated reading of Pollock’s theory of state capitalism.” Ibid., 280 (fn 71). According to Noerr, this ‘positivistic’ approach to the theory of state capitalism would entail “the positivist substitution of historical, political, or psychological laws for economic ones.” Ibid., 234. However, Horkheimer accuses Pollock of making exactly this kind of substitution—and specifically of psychologism—in a letter to Franz Neumann dated August 2 1941.
