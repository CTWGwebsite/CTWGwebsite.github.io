Many of them have already been thought and written down by others: We are repeating them here because we find them relevant to our present concern. Those interested in our inspirations can consult the list at the end.</p> <p>While we did not feel the need to use the word ‘racket’ in all of these fragments, they nonetheless lie in the broader orbit of ‘racket theory.’ At some points we have opted for nuance, at others for a certain degree of tactical exaggeration. In discussing such a broad array of topics, we are assaying the utility of the concept of the racket as a theoretical northstar.</p> <h2 id="ça-nira-pas"><em>Ça n’ira pas</em></h2> <p>We would like to be clear about who we are not. We identify as our enemies the Zionist, chauvinist, and self-proclaimed “anti-fascist” distorters of critical theory. Certain scholars, many of them German and Austrian, have taken it upon themselves to draft the critical theory of Adorno, Horkheimer, and the rest into their defenses of the genocidal project of Zionism. Today we are not surprised when, upon consulting a text allegedly concerned with <em>kritische Theorie</em>, we find mad rants about the threat of <em>Islamo-Faschismus</em>.</p> <p>Ever the defenders of bourgeois barbarism, these charlatans construct an absolute barrier between the <em>djihadistische</em>, <em>islamistische</em> rackets and the holy European Rule of Law. The presence of exceptional executive powers in the Islamic Republic of Iran becomes justification for the use of the exceptional military powers of NATO against its population. State failure born from colonialism and imperialism becomes justification for interventions guaranteed to re-entrench it. Sectarian violence in Syria is solved by indiscriminate bombing.</p> <p>Even among those who are smart enough not to explicitly lend their support to imperialist genocide, the “anti-nationalist” reflex, admirably developed against European nationalist chauvinism by Marxists during the first World War, becomes in a horrific reversal a mask for Western chauvinism—an alibi for ignoring the real dominations on the basis of race, nation, ethnicity, gender, sexuality… and counter-movements which necessarily must begin on those terms. “Of course,” they protest, “I do not approve of the present actions of the IDF and Netanyahu’s government, but—” But what! The supposed “critics” who flatten these quite real mediations in a slogan of “no war but the class war” have taken up a political stance monstrously retrograde even in comparison with the “black and white, unite and fight” mentality of Earl Browder’s CPUSA at the moment of its capitulation to capitalism. Their activity is more reminiscent of the PCF’s active participation in the colonial administration of Algeria, albeit thankfully confined to the realm of online posts, moronic pamphlets, academic bickering, and subcultural activity.</p> <p>If we refuse to remain blind to Zionist violence as Zionist violence, how then should we approach it? For a long time the Zionist movement (and eventually the State of Israel) was organized around the trifecta of the apartheid Zionist labor racket, which violently excluded Palestinians and other Arabs; the settlements and kibbutzim, which exploited and dispossessed Palestinians; and the Haganah-cum-IDF, which murdered them. Then came the era of the internal ethnic and sectarian rackets, a development correlated with the decline of the Labor Zionist racket and growth of the explicitly fascist streak in Israeli politics. The various occupational strategies for turning Palestine into a Bantustan—the collaborationism of Fatah in the West Bank, arming of Yasser abu Shabab’s bandits in Gaza, attempts to recruit the elites of clans and Bedouin tribes, the Oslo Accords—are racket-like in character. The strategies of genocide, meanwhile, dispense with the pretense of exploitation entirely.</p> <p>Our opponents fail to understand that the perversion of the concept of the racket for dull critiques of <em>Djihadismus</em>—an orientalist discursive construct that has relatively little in common with actual Salafi jihadism (an incredibly marginal political tendency in Palestine)—discredits in advance any attempt to understand the real human tragedy of reactionary Islamism through the lens of critical theory. It is easier to say that a man takes up the gun because of his religion, his greed, or his hatred of Jews than to argue he does it because he is <em>rimaybé</em>, marked from birth as a descendent of slaves and desperate for a life worth living. The petty-bourgeois background of many of the most infamous jihadis suggests an analogy with fascism, but it also suggests an analogy with socialism. Stereotyped, racist thinking will get us nowhere.</p> <h2 id="all-those-who-toil">All Those Who Toil</h2> <p>At the same time that marriage was contractualized in the United States and the tradition of common law marriage was left behind—a moment that cannot be detached from post-Reconstruction attempts to craft a legal regime that could restore slavery in all but name—the ‘nuclear family’ division of domestic and paid labor took shape. Similar divisions of labor developed around the same time in other centers of developed capitalism such as England and Australia under the influence of surging racketized and reformist labor movements.</p> <p>In the global south, things developed differently. The exploitation of women in domestic familial work and private wage labor became deeply integrated. In India, construction companies use contractors to hire husband-wife (<em>jodi</em>) pairs from marginalized communities as migrant laborers with little to no social security. The wife is hired not only for construction labor but also for the social reproduction of the family. She is expected to take care of the children, cook, and do all other miscellaneous tasks required to sustain her family. The children that accompany the pairs help with the menial tasks of construction labor when they are not occupied with ragged public schools (if they even have the opportunity to attend schools, given the nature of short term migrant labor). They are trained as construction workers from their childhood due to their proximity with the work.</p> <p>Unlike the expectations of the early socialists and most liberals, capitalism’s dynamic of constant expansion absorbed, reterritorialized, and reproduced traditional gendered forms of domination rather than eliminating them. The garment industry and spinning mills of Tamil Nadu, which export a sizable portion of its product to the international market, are powered by the labor of teenagers. Girls from very poor backgrounds are contracted for three years, housed in small dorms, and made to work for stipends much lower than minimum wage. However, their income over the course of their three year long tenure is just enough for their dowry as they reach legally marriageable age. The loop is closed, and the racket continues.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>From a purely economic-functional perspective, marriage (and indeed cohabitational relationships outside of marriage) almost appear as a sentimental residue coating the mechanisms of the household system, that uneasy compromise between private property and human existence. The stripping of the vestigial religious trappings around marriage and the abolition of its monopoly on romantic pairing and cohabitation should reduce the family to what economists say it always was: a vehicle for provisioning of commodities to satisfy basic humans needs (food, shelter, etc.), the transmission of property, and pooling of income/wealth. But this does not happen. Every time an antique legal pretense for the subordination of women within the household is struck down, a new or previously dormant piece of law—accompanied by a political-ideological campaign—seems to crop up and ‘inadvertently’ divert the path of progress.</p> <p>This is not a purely political outcome. The nexus of gendered labor in the household-family locus cannot disappear into the ‘automatic’ mechanisms of value because it brushes up against an objective limit to capital, namely the reproduction of labor power. Both the micro- and macro-rhythms of corporeal human life, insofar as they are even understood, are fundamentally out of sync with the mechanical rhythms of capital’s accumulation, circulation, and turnover. Scientific management of the human body already has a name: torture. The unprofitable tasks of care are therefore bestowed upon non-profit institutions (schools, hospitals, etc.) and individuals.</p> <p>Legal-political reinforcement of gender—and hence its concomitant forms of exploitation and subordination—can thus be seen, at least in part, as an opportunistic attempt to foist this anomalous labor back on those who, for historical reasons, have little power to refuse it. The housewife phenomenon persists because the domestic work of social reproduction is unprofitable and cannot be made into capitalist production, nor can existing production absorb it as labor-power.</p> <h2 id="the-game-was-rigged-from-the-start">The Game Was Rigged From the Start</h2> <p>It has been said that to transition is to renege on agreements that were previously assumed, albeit never actually signed for. The same goes for coming out in general. Some queer people are lucky, born to kind parents and/or a relatively accepting milieu. Most are confronted with the prospect of giving up the protections of various institutions of social reproduction—the family, the hegemonic order of gender, medical and psychiatric standards of normality—because the forms of domination that accompanied them were unbearable. The simple day-by-day practice of living outside them represents a non-negligible form of resistance against them.</p> <p>Oftentimes trans people in particular are thrown headfirst into continual underemployment, if not outright unemployment and even lumpen conditions. They may be patronized or brutalized depending on the valences of their class background, social milieu, and particular gender (e.g. the different but overlapping strategies for policing trans women vs. trans men). The grim realities facing queer and trans people bely the accusation—sometimes explicit, sometimes merely implied—that they are somehow an economically privileged group.</p> <p>Queer people in general and trans people in particular are a small minority of the population with minimal political influence. Why, then, does the granting of very limited legal measures of acceptance provoke such an apocalyptic sense in our enemies? One always finds the same stereotyped accusations: queerness is a threat to the family and children, and therefore the nation and race. It is a threat to “nature,” “man,” and “civilization.” Of course, it is in the obverse that we see the true face of death—empty identity and silent obedience to authority. The mildest suggestion of a queer aporia in the gender regime sets off the obsessive policing instinct of its loyal attack dogs. The passion with which these dogs are called to defend the holy gender relation betrays their correct intuition of how fragile this supposed ‘eternal’ ironclad structure really is.</p> <p>One can be seduced by a thinking that invokes symbolic abstractions of power like “identity” and “death.” We must never forget that behind the pageantry of gender reaction lurks an all too concrete threat of murder, punishment delivered for the crime of a free participation in life.</p> <h2 id="nothing-for-nothing">Nothing for Nothing</h2> <p>A liberal manager’s lament: his ‘white working class’ brothers in their ignorance fight for austerity (Trump, Le Pen, Reform). His Daily Politics Observer soothingly repeats a watered-down Du Bois ad nauseum in explanation: poor whites did this because in return they receive psychic returns. Is there fruit that hangs lower? Such retreats to psychological compensation arguments is lamentable but understandable given the lack of any clear economic benefits in their political programs. Have elites secured the replacement of material economy by the psychic economy of ideology? We don’t think so. Psychological gratification at the level of social effectivity cannot be engineered by the ruling class so readily, if indeed at all.</p> <p>Psychic economy is everywhere in constant interpenetration with the material economy. Money writes “invasion” on the wall. White flight follows, motivated by immediate racial resentment and reinforced through positive economic motivations. Suburban areas come to have genuinely superior infrastructure and tax resources to the ‘inner cities.’ The wages of whiteness take the form of inclusion in ever-shrinking welfare societies, and the willingness to accept the racialized exclusions which those societies always involved. Fantasies of whiteness provide an alibi for this increasing austerity. Welfare is condemned in racially-charged invectives, conveniently omitting mention of the racially exclusive benefits enjoyed by the caucasian contingent—what we might call ‘white-fare.’</p> <p>Each citation, whether explicit, tends to omit the gist of <em>Black Reconstruction</em>, that actually making good on racist gambles is essentially impossible. The poor white places a poor bet. The contract’s rewards grow little with time. Under the spell of “invasion,” each vote exchanges upkeep for “security” until security takes the wheel. “Invasion” gets bigger still, cast in fulsome neon, on chyron, marquee. Clearly, the ‘forgotten man’ can do no better than a gun bought with what remains. What else can protect the little box whose mortgage is subprime? Money, now “Equity,” may foreclose, but the real box of white fantasy was always the womb, the genetic line of credit, which the gun can certainly protect. After all, strange fruit hangs higher. If all else fails, there’s apples on the sportsbook, with free money on the first parlay.</p> <h2 id="stupidity-machines">Stupidity Machines</h2> <p>The appeal to stupidity as an explanation for some social fact is generally an argumentative move that only serves to expose the intellectual debility of its own executor. Submission to this tendency would itself be a submission to stupidity however, a tacit acknowledgement of its impenetrability to the intellect.</p> <p>Cruelty and stupidity go together. Reactionary attacks on the academy are less explained by the claim that it is a base of principled resistance—it is not—than by the right’s fundamental revulsion at learning and sense that their sadism can be lazily indulged by bludgeoning a victim too cowardly to fight back. (Also, since when have elementary schools been part of ‘the academy?’) It is a testament to the idiocy of the political situation that we are told to avoid “sanewashing” the policies of reaction.</p> <p>Stupidity is not a scar; it is a festering wound. Through his battles with the sophists, Plato’s Socrates proved that to do evil to another is to make both oneself and one’s victim worse. Thus, cruelty appears as a vector for stupidity. Deprivation and punishment have no educational value, and any society which turns such viciousness into socially load-bearing practices will inevitably turn its back on whatever culture had once been enabled by brutal enforcement of the distinction between hand and head. Today’s plague of stupidity exacerbates the ambient regime of fear inherent to our violent society into an unending chain of moral panics, which today find their cultural expression in a foul cornucopia of AI-generated images and videos.</p> <p>The explosion of AI propaganda symbolizes the construction of a new Babel—in reverting to the supposedly universal language of images, we will eventually be cursed with the inability to understand one another. Media constructs us as passive consumers and proud reproducers. It is not uncommon for someone to casually announce that they rely on Chat GPT for emotional support. They might as well have just come out as a proud coprophage, for the difference between the proud and shameless consumption of ‘slop’ and eating one’s own shit is one of appearance, not essence.</p> <h2 id="fascicules">Fascicules</h2> <p>The ballot box is a lever of fascization, but not because some mythical poor whites are forced to sign on to fascism for economic reasons. The secret ballot of liberalism posits fascism as one ticket among others, a personal choice. (The degree of political divergence between men and women makes it statistically certain that a non-trivial number of heterosexual couples in many countries are made up of a fascist man and a liberal woman). In reality, the ballot is an index of the alienated pseudo-individuality assumed by <em>Citoyen</em> <em>Sujet</em> when confronted by the state.</p> <p>Even when open fascism does not appear on the ballot, the fascism of imperialism is always a fundamental part of the hegemonic consensus. This is without getting into the islands of fascism that dot liberal capitalist society—Guantanamo Bay, European and American concentration camps for migrants and refugees, Zionist apartheid, prisons in general, your local police precinct, etc. Each of these are socio-magnetic accelerators for what Trotsky famously called “particle[s] of Hitler,” or, better yet, fascicules.</p> <h2 id="gregarious">Gregarious</h2> <p>Critics of so-called ‘identity politics’ attack the concrete manifestations of the tendency to associate in the name of a class association which does not presently exist. This is quite an untimely critique, as for most proletarians today class is precisely an abstract social category whose force is only felt negatively (much to the chagrin of contemporary vulgar workerists).</p> <p>It is just as easy for ‘class politics’ to fall into racketeering as it is for ‘identity politics’ (leaving aside the fact that many forms of ‘identity politics’ simply are class politics in a special idiom). They are both rather elementary political forms of basic human groupishness. Group life is as fundamental to <em>homo sapiens</em> as walking upright and making tools. This is the kernel of truth to liberal hysterics about “tribalism” and its rise—a discourse that runs both class and identity politics through the wash of primitivizing abstraction, ridding them of the impurities of class antagonism that underlie their qualitative unity-in-difference and reducing them to the bleach white husk of pure rackets. If we peer further into the hidden abode of this discursive production a further truth is revealed: That behind the obfuscating immediacy of its product lie the very forces of separation that impart groups themselves with the the violent rhythms and high pressure conditions that characterize their contemporary form and deprive us of the kind of group life given to collective learning.</p> <p>The influence of psychological factors in the composition and decomposition of political groups is often neglected at the level of theory. (It is almost as if organization is a method to overcome the brute animal mind, to subdue the spirited and appetitive parts of our souls.) We detect a fear in this neglect, a fear that mere acknowledgment of such factors would debase the political subjectivity of militants and confirm reactionary accusations of resentment and instability. But anyone who has been in a group—that is, anyone whatsoever—can tell you that association invariably introduces new psychological dynamics and does little to suppress preexisting ones. Bion’s simple observation stands the test of time: “It is clear that when a group forms the individuals forming it hope to achieve some satisfaction from it. It is also clear that the first thing they are aware of is a sense of frustration produced by the presence of the group of which they are members.”</p> <h2 id="smedleys-theory">Smedley’s Theory</h2> <p>People in the first half of the twentieth century could not decide whether aerial warfare was chivalrous or barbaric—they had forgotten that these terms are coextensive. Fighter planes served to gather intelligence for artillery bombardments and later to protect bombers. It is a testament to the impotence of empathy that warplanes can be an object of admiration after Hiroshima.</p> <p>Today bombing insulates the masses of the first world, and of the United States in particular, from the realities of war. By permitting, at the technological-logistical level, ‘non-war’ military adventures (they were called “police actions” by the British Empire) to use minimal direct combat personnel, bombing rescued the population from mobilization and the ruling class from the travail of legitimating mobilization.</p> <p>In the case of drone warfare, combat personnel is entirely forgone. The proliferation of jamming devices in the Russo-Ukrainian war has led both militaries to control their close-range first person view “suicide drones” with spools of fiber optic cable, which after detonation are left eerily draped across the artillery-battered landscape. A bundle of consumer technlogies—VR headsets, hobbyist quadcopters, etc—combine into a militarized cybernetic organism that simulates the suicide of its operator and actualizes the murder of its target. The ‘divine wind’ that possessed Japanese <em>kamikaze</em> pilots is warded off by the technological ritualization of interfacing with death.</p> <h2 id="spark">Spark</h2> <p>Imperialist genocide is legitimated by the blackmail of extinction. The hypertrophy of humanity’s capacity for destruction has transformed the foundation of the distinction between the sovereign civilization of the first world and abject violability of the third into the former’s ability to initiate a planetary extinction event at will.</p> <h2 id="descendants-of-cain">Descendants of Cain</h2> <p>How can Americans confront their Pilgrim Fathers? A positive reading: they were a cooperative body, though admittedly not freely associated, seeing as they were contractually bound. Everything in the colony was to be common stock for seven years, so perhaps they were even socialists of some kind. (In the event, they lasted only three before dividing the land they had claimed into separate plots for each family.) A negative reading: they were a unit of productive capital, the proceeds of which would be meted out to the ‘adventurers’ (investors) and ‘planters’ (settlers) after seven years. <em>Omnia sunt communia</em>, but only until the creditors come calling.</p> <p>Bizarre social set-ups like that of the Pilgrims are one of the more remarkable features of early stage settler-colonial projects. The penal society of New South Wales and early kibbutzim of Mandatory Palestine must also be mentioned in this context. While the settlers of Australia’s ‘First Fleet’ had no say in the matter, the utopian appeal of religious toleration in the case of the Pilgrims and an apparently socialist project in the case of Zionism certainly played an important part in the growth of these settler-colonial movements. Even Thomas More’s Utopia was a colonial endeavor, having been founded by King Utopus, who conquered the peninsula of Abraxa and immediately forced the “rude and uncivilised inhabitants” to dig a massive channel such that the landmass was made into an island.</p> <p>A common thread in these settler-colonial projects is a pretension to universalism—democracy, socialism, moral improvement, religion—which serves as a mask for the advance of particularity. Indeed, there is a certain destructive intertwinement of the universal and particular that is peculiar to settler-colonialism. The petty sovereignty of the settler emerges from his—and later <em>her</em>—proprietorship in combination with the assumption of the sovereign’s power, which is not merely particular but positively singular, in the specific capacity of violence. <em>De jure</em> claims on territory were (and are) made <em>de facto</em>, in large part, through the parcelized conquest carried out by especially bold settlers who rely on the state to back them up if needed. When individual prosecution of social war against the native begets resistance, the interloper finds themself being struck down with whatever weapon was at hand. For the wages of the settler’s sin is death, a pseudo-martyrdom that lifts up their vengeful spirit to circulate eternally in the world-soul of empire.</p> <h2 id="arrows-without-maxims">Arrows Without Maxims</h2> <p>Going back and reading reports about “fascism” (or the “alt-right”) from the last decade, one is struck by how much attention was given to ultimately ephemeral organizations and personalities. They were never made to last in the first place. The police have always done the job much more effectively.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>We must not allow ourselves to be misled by spatial and magnitudinal metaphors. The fact that so many philosophical and scientific terms are originally spatial metaphors of one kind or another is no reason to surrender to these ingrained linguistic habits.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>The racket designates a social form that drifts between functions of redistribution, exploitation, domination, protection, and production. The question is whether or not such a concept designates a historical reality, or if it can at least lead us to one.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>The Fifth Monarchist tract “A Door of Hope” called for the abolition of the right of primogeniture and overthrow of the “Nimrod spirit and monopolies of elder Brethren.” How tame partible inheritance has made us!</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>The Bolsheviks introduced the slogan “turn the imperialist war into a civil war.” The inverse could be the slogan of fascism.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>The racket is the social structure adequate to class society in its monopoly form. Solidarity is its mediating force which, by conflict and conceit, at once transforms the particular racket into the horizon of the individual and transforms the collective of such reified persons into that which may overstep this boundary. Solidarity is the law, but it is no guarantee.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>Even those who exit, and seek to lay hold of greater legislative and executive powers beyond its walls, tend to find themselves, sooner or later, playing racket sports in the grounds of the vampire castle.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>The podcast is the radio of austerity. No singular sovereign voice but rather a thousand little führers legislating, on a casual basis, the necessity of precarity and its incessant grind, bookended by ad reads.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>Two strategic moves of contemporary reaction: closing ranks and forcing buy-in.</p> <h2 id="multiple-choice-question">Multiple Choice Question</h2> <p>For all its faults, there is still something admirable in Bakunin’s obsession with the <em>lumpen</em>, with cossacks, bandits, and vagabonds. The fatal flaw was that he could only see the excluded as harbingers of destruction, assigning any positivity they possessed to the dynamism of their Slavic blood and leaving serious social analysis by the wayside. In this context, we can say that Bakunin’s consistency provides a refreshing contrast to Marx’s moralistic and largely arbitrary distinction between the “reserve army of labor” and “paupers” on one hand and the “actual lumpenproletariat” on the other. Marx told two marginally different stories about the origins of these two groupings: the former were a product and necessary condition of capitalist production and the latter was the spoiled refuse of all the ruined classes of history. In both of these stories, Marx chose not to emphasize the fact—of which he was well aware—that informal labor, including many of its ‘criminal’ varieties, was a necessary element in both the reproduction of the working class and in the valorization process of capital. Perhaps he couldn’t figure out how to fit it into the argumentative structure of <em>Capital</em>. The actual reason doesn’t matter.</p> <p>Conditions of informality and nebulous, sub-legal wage agreements are hegemonic in many parts of the world. While some arrangements may be classified as mere formal subsumption of labor under capital, it can be comfortably said that most are structured from the ground up in line with the institutions of mature capitalism. Companies hire workers on short contracts without granting legal recognition of the workers as employees subject to rights and benefits. Workers are constantly cycled out. A large reserve of labor waits, ready to sign these contracts in hopes of being those whose diligence and work ethic would finally translate to full time employee status. Informality is the state of constant insecurity: the displacement of people from one occupation to another and from one location to another.</p> <p>Alongside informal employment, one inevitably finds two other sources of income in the ‘grey economy.’ Firstly, there are the forms of small proprietorship so miniscule in scale and laden with self-exploitation that describing them as “petty bourgeois” seems euphemistic, if not sarcastic. (Although one must not lose sight of the genuine petty capitalists in the so-called informal sector.) Secondly, there are the various less than legal ways of earning money: sex work, theft, fraud, trade in illegal goods, begging, etc. All three factors might be practiced in the same household, or by the same person at different times. Add to this a preponderance of debt—owed to either traditional loan sharks and moneylenders or modern microfinanciers—and circular patterns of migration between the city and the countryside, and a basic picture of the situation begins to emerge.</p> <p>From Marx to Adorno, the utopian hope that capitalism would give the conditions for socialisation of production was never realized. The functioning of capitalism has always been highlighted by its integration of traditional forms of hierarchy and conditions of informality. Throughout capitalism’s long history, there was never a period of truly liberal free competition and social security for workers. Spatial metaphors that place the so-called surplus population ‘outside’ of the circuits of capital are grievously outdated. Even during its brief heyday in the Global North, capitalism functioned through the dispersion of informality and the mobilization of traditional and direct forms of domination. This is only more so the case in the Global South. The household labor of lower caste women and the production of luxury products throughout the world are part of the same process.</p> <h2 id="the-dissection-of-god">The Dissection of God</h2> <p>Ambedkar wrote that caste is a graded hierarchy: thousands of groups tediously segregated and placed in a rigid order of rank, most of them content with their relative position. At least they aren’t the untouchables excluded by civilised society: those who are occupied with sanitation work, manual scavenging, and the dead. The ones who clean are the ones excluded, or rather polluted; women, like the lower castes, are ‘naturally’ polluted as they bleed, bear children, and are bound to take care of the household. Thus the long history of the Indian subcontinent has been a history of caste rackets based on the exclusion of dalits and women, rackets that effectively monopolised whole industries into their enclosures and subsumed everyone who came in contact with them. The Buddhist social reformers, the Muslim empires, the British Raj, and the Christian missions were all deeply integrated within caste society. Contrary to what Indian law would have us believe in an attempt to exclude positive discrimination from non-Hindu Dalits, castes do not have a religion apart from the Brahminical domination that ties the subcontinent together. After all, no one wants to clean their own shit.</p> <p>Caste society is an unending initiation ritual. It begins even before birth, as the Brahmin astrologer prescribes the auspicious time of birth and name for the child based on the movements of the stars. Then come the rituals of the girlchild entering puberty—for she is ready to reproduce her caste—and the very tedious marriage customs ordained by the Brahmins. Any resistance to the predetermined initiation and its cyclical history becomes a grave threat to caste society; neither hints of romance between individuals from unequal castes nor even simple physical entry into upper caste spaces are permitted. These norms are to be punished by extreme violence or murder if breached. The Brahmin would rather kill his own daughter than be initiated into a Dalit world. The famous <em>dharma</em> or duty of Hindu mythology is the duty of being bound to caste rackets, of following their intricate rules and rituals. Rather than affirm the universality of everyone’s duty to the other, the myth affirms the totality of caste relations. No wonder that the deity King Rama became the favored figure of modern Hindutva. The avatar who would subject his wife to the ordeal of fire to save the honor of his caste becomes the model of duty bound Hindus, who imagine themselves saving the honor of their religion against the perceived threat of the Muslim invaders.</p> <p>Caste is far from being a national-religious bulwark against Islam. Indeed, castes exist only insofar as certain groups can dominate other groups ‘below’ them. The upper castes have access to superior conditions of social reproduction and are availed of the need to dirty their own hands. They dominate others and thereby exclude themselves from manual labor. As Ambedkar argued, castes are “enclosed classes” maintained throughout their long history by endogamy and its necessary presupposition: control over women’s bodies. In capitalism, caste society is fully integrated into a capitalist division of labor that reproduces and maintains its enclosure. As Dalits are relegated to the informal economy and bound to undignified, unseen labour, the so-called caste Hindus are allowed to enter into formal contracts recognized as workers, bosses, and <em>Maliks</em>. Caste society is racket society par excellence.</p> <h2 id="chinga-la-migra">Chinga la Migra</h2> <p>Exploitation of—and subsequent dependence on—migrant labor is a feature common to many countries in both the Global North and Global South, from Singapore to South Africa. The presence of legally designated <em>Untermenschen</em> has become something natural for those lucky enough to possess citizenship. Despite their undeniable presence within the ‘host country’ both physically and socio-economically as nannies, manual workers, intellectuals, neighbors, and more, they are marked as outsiders. Such a hegemonic system of brutality invariably wrongs the migrant, but the citizen is likewise scarred by the stability of their own identity and position. The mere existence of the legal category of ‘citizen’ is a sign of social dysfunction, a veritable mark of the beast branded on the body politic possessed by the devil.</p> <p>This dysfunction operates via a meshwork of legal, ideological, and interpersonal layers; put most succinctly, it operates like a racket. Take for example the infamous kafala system in the GCC countries. In the popular consciousness, kafala evokes a uniform system of migrant labor administration, one that has little variation among the GCC countries. It elicits an impression of an <em>exceptional</em> site of exploitation, isolation, and degradation. In fact, it is often thought about as modern day ‘slavery.’ While these impressions contain truth, they remain obfuscatory, reinforcing the false self-conceptualization through which the racket presents itself.</p> <p>In brief, the kafala system is a worker-sponsorship regime of migrant governance, one that can be broadly conceptualized as a nexus of governmental policies and laws common to all GCC countries, despite some key differences between them. A large portion of the labor importation facilitated by the kafala system is domestic labor, a sector usually seen as external to the labor relation of migrant-citizen. Indeed, the migrant domestic laborer in the Persian Gulf reveals the true nature of the kafala racket not as an exceptional site of labor exploitation, but as an <em>exemplary</em> one. The purity—if we can call it that—of the kafala system sheds light on the luxury fashion sweatshops of Italy, strawberry farms of California, and industrial exploitation of rural <em>Hukou</em> workers of China. It exists only through a contingent configuration of the grotesquely uneven international division of labor, where the state outsources labor governance onto the family unit. This arrangement has become both the primary structure of class antagonism and an indispensable element of social reproduction in the GCC countries.</p> <p>From this lens, the kafala system reveals itself as an exemplary racket: it posits a false opposition between international labor norms and national sovereignty, equates the citizen-migrant and employer-worker relations, and, most importantly, reframes structural labor relations as interpersonal ones. We can see how this racket’s inside/outside dynamic enables delusion at all levels: the sovereign state appears to defend citizens against encroachment of their “rights” by international forces, thus citizens feel duty-bound to protect the state’s honor. The citizen manages the impossible task of keeping permanent residents as perpetual outsiders, guarding a guest-host fiction that depends on willful blindness—the ultimate expression being lawmakers raised by migrant domestic workers now advocating nationality quotas against their own social mothers.</p> <p>The kafala system’s displacement of labor governance onto families represents just one variation among migrant labor rackets. Across different contexts, these systems share a common logic of mystification, though their specific mechanisms vary considerably. In India, internal migrant labor operates through caste and kin networks that create their own form of displaced governance and funnel workers into specific industries in the urban centers. The workers do not have any attachment to the place or region, only to their own caste groups and the industry—workers are hired from distant villages precisely because it hinders effective class solidarity. Development projects that displace the native population and highly polluting industries have an especially large section of migrant workers, who become a scapegoat for the misery caused by the industry. Indian labor is also strongly represented outside of the subcontinent: manual workers go to the Gulf, and intellectual workers try to find a more permanent home in one of the countries of the First World. The United States’ H1-B visa for skilled workers is especially prized.</p> <p>But H1-B has come under fire recently. In the controversy amongst the American right about the H1-B visa program and similar schemes, it is hard not to see the extreme white nationalist side of the debate as the bad conscience of its “globalist” counterpart. H1-B is merely a legal formalization of the type of domination that employers have been able to exert over migrant workers of all skill levels for decades, with deportation being among the most severe acts of domination at their disposal. The US deportation legal regime emerged from many of the worst bodies of Anglo-American law: English common law on “vagabonds,” the fugitive slave laws, and late 19th century anti-Chinese legislation. (With regard to the latter, we cannot forget the unhappy history of the American labor movement, however weak it was, in legitimizing anti-immigrant legislation.) The practice of deportation intersected with citizenship law—which was explicitly racial until the 1950s—and the social institution of race. The resulting non-identity of legal-racial, social-racial, and citizenship statuses historically made it very easy for the state (with consent from capital) to deport both resident Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans with legal citizenship.</p> <p>The Republican Party (and the ruling class in general) probably does not actually have a worked out plan for immigrants—how could they devise a solution when they cannot even agree on what the problem is? We can still offer our own hypothesis, however. The dream brewing in the minds of the politicians who float the possibility of a ‘special military operation’ in Mexico and demand ICE gestapo squads be sent into every barrio is precisely that of an updated version of the old Bracero program that would take inspiration from the modern kafala system, if not some even more entrenched system of apartheid. (When Trump opines that “people who live in the inner city” can no longer be forced into agricultural labor, is he not giving the game away?) By removing immigrants from society at large, they hope that the citizenry will forget that they are anything other than disposable bodies that can be deported to free-fire zones or concentration camps when they’ve exhausted their utility for capital.</p> <p>Such an attack inevitably provokes a response, however. The level of ongoing resistance against rapidly fascisizing immigration authorities in the US and the centrality of anti-immigration politics to the so-called populist right globally are confirmations of Marcuse’s hypothesis that the regime of preventative counter-revolution in the first world is organized precisely against <em>international</em> revolution.</p> <h2 id="and-still">And Still…</h2> <p>With the development of modern industrial technology, the problem of temporal particularism is posed. The state of humanity’s material culture means that even defensive campaigns can make us all worse off in the long run. One often hears the argument that the politicians who fight against ‘responsible’ climate politics do not care because they will not be around to experience the consequences. They have annihilated the future and turned away from its morbid face in order to maintain their position in the mutilated present, from which everything both good and bad seems thinkably infinite. It is the second childhood of capitalist society.</p> <p>And yet, it is too easy to attribute evil to age. The bellicose posture of the United States’ gerontocrats less resembles the senile rage of a declining Faustian West than it does the premature senescence of a punch-drunk fighter who is still tough enough to hurt everyone around him. (The recent announcement that the UFC plans to hold an event at the White House in 2026 suggests that the elective affinity between brain injury and reaction may be even greater than we are suggesting.)</p> <h2 id="fossil-fuel">Fossil Fuel</h2> <p>With the invention of the steam engine the inert carbon stores of extinct plant and animal matter were transformed into the fuel for the expansion of the capitalist form of commodity production. Rather than acting as mere objects of labour like other extracted resources, fossil fuels immediately appeared as a means of labour: actualized as the lifeblood of the machines to which the workers were made mere appendages and, in this way, rendered just as lifeless as the long dead creatures burning in the furnaces. This was traditionally understood as a dual process of transformation and actualisation, the work of an active human industry upon a passive nature. However, here we see the roles dialectically reversed: set free from the land by human hands, the dead could now be put to work once more as a force of production by which those hands would be transformed, shackled and shackling all life to the same fate.</p> <p>Now, flash forward 200 years into the future.</p> <p>Here the internal combustion engine and its commercial reproduction have become ubiquitous. The dead now increasingly function not only as the lifeblood of production but also that of circulation. Humanity and commodities are freer than they ever were before and, so transformed, their labour and their price may be actualised anywhere on Earth. Commodities flow from where they are cheapest to produce to where they command the highest price. Workers find themselves commuting ever greater distances at ever greater velocities to ever greater personal cost, whether that be from suburb to city or by migratory flows attracted to whatever mass of capital is revving its engine. On the highways, skyways, railroads and shipping routes, everywhere the dead keep us hurtling towards extinction.</p> <p>Next figure:</p> <p>The angel of history is at a crossroads. Where one great car crash unceasingly takes shape. The headwinds of onrushing vehicles fill its wings, blowing it back seemingly in all directions. Can this catastrophe be averted? Could we not have changed course? With what, then, does it end? If there exist answers to these questions, they are to be found in the fragments, the fossils, recoverable from that one immense pile of rubble on rubble already accumulated by the roadside. These dead actualities of history are too the figures of a world not-yet living. While the dead remain doomed to labour upon the living and transform us into living-dead, both remain but fuel for progress.</p> <h2 id="protocols">Protocols</h2> <p>Conspiracy theorists are beholden to the positivistic illusion that, because everything must supposedly decompose, in some metaphysical-epistemological way, into individuals, the most efficient way to discover the truth is biographical investigation of individuals. The man who storms a pizza place in search of tortured children is closer to science than the one who believes the truth lies in an exegesis of half century-old tabloids and pulp literature. What unites them is the untimely belief in the power of truth for the purposes of propaganda, a belief which the theorist cannot maintain forever when faced with the unbearable futility of his interventions. The consequent lamentation for the errance of the deceived masses leads inevitably to a (shockingly pleasurable!) elitist turn inwards, the coining of shibboleths and code-words, and esoteric writing practices. The discourse that ultimately emerges is just as inscrutable, exclusive, and partial as the “academic” paradigm it was originally organized against.</p> <h2 id="well-theres-your-problem">Well, There’s Your Problem</h2> <p>‘Conceptual engineering’ is a dead end. Disinfected of any germ of radicality that may have once persisted in it. The conceptual assembly line of the academy produces, post hoc, the pretext for whatever the ruling class are already doing, while at the same time delimiting the discourse such that any theoretical resistance can be simply reincorporated into the ideological infrastructure. The view of solidarity that such thought has produced is one of pragmatic collective action amongst various interest groups, a rationality which still retains the essence of social domination. This racket realism is what Horkheimer called “the mind of class society in its streamlined form.” It does not regard the concept from the perspective of transformation but constructs schemas and categories by which these groups would articulate themselves in prearranged forms and in prearranged ways “completely alien to their own nature.” When the people, or the concept, will not comply with his purposeful rule, the engineer throws up his hands in mock surrender. The engineer’s concept was not wrong; it just needed some tinkering. There are blind spots in our thinking—no doubt! But it is simply a matter of review and refinement. Put the hammers down, you luddites! The system will be working soon.</p> <h2 id="teleology">Teleology</h2> <p>It seems that, to a greater extent than the other classes in capitalism, the petty bourgeoisie (whatever it may be that is designated by this term) can only achieve unity by first dividing itself and waging an ‘internal’ struggle. Whatever coherence the concept obtains at the level of theory emerges out of historical struggles whose outcome was not (and is not) predetermined. Where one particular occupational cohort—say, public school teachers—stands in the political situation is not an immediate consequence of its relation to capital or the state.</p> <p>The political ambiguity of this amorphous ‘stratum’ sandwiched between the proletarian and the capitalist is as objective as it is immense. Even the degree to which they genuinely or even approximately enjoy the powers of private property (or mere usufruct ‘possession’) varies according to the vicissitudes of the economic conjuncture. Even the traditional petty bourgeoisie are often scarcely more than parasitic entities dependent on large firms. It makes little difference whether one interprets their position as order-givers subject to constraints from above or order-takers given limited powers over those below them. Their activity is structured by the division between intellectual and manual labor at the technical level, the social level, or both; this division is, in turn, part of the bedrock of class society—not something that can be abolished with the stroke of a pen. All attempts to introduce more ‘current’ or empirically specific substitute concepts are doomed to failure because they implicitly deny the fundamental multivalence of the object under scrutiny.</p> <h2 id="list-of-people-whose-ideas-we-took">List of People Whose Ideas We Took</h2> <p>In the absence of a traditional bibliography, please accept this (non-exhaustive) list of people whose ideas we have appropriated in the production of this text.

Wittfogel’s “Natural Factors in Economic History” article transposed to the blog format. A few important notes: per the reading announcement, the below presentation builds from Wittfogel’s broader work on “Geographical Materialism,” and not the “Natural Factors” work alone. Moreover, this blog post is structured with the oral presentation first, followed by the translated excerpt. For the translation, please be advised that the footnotes were left untranslated as is. We hope these materials serve as an early eco-Marxist model for engaging with contemporary discussions on the value of nature, the dual character of labor-power as both “social” process and “natural” process, and the dynamic relationship between laborers and their geographical environment.</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>The CTWG Editorial Team</p> <h2 id="karl-august-wittfogels-system-of-historical-materialism-presentation">Karl August Wittfogel’s System of Historical Materialism (presentation)</h2> <p>Today we are going to discuss excerpts from two essays by Karl August Wittfogel. But, before we get into Wittfogel’s theories, I want to provide a quick biographical overview.<br/> Wittfogel was born in 1896 to a protestant family in Germany. He studied the humanities at university before being drafted into the German army in 1917. He then became a Marxist in the aftermath of the war, briefly joining Kautsky’s Independent Social Democrats before moving to the newly formed Communist Party in 1920. In 1921 he began pursuing what would become his main academic interest, the study of China within the social sciences. His first works are mainly historical, although he dabbled in philosophy of science/knowledge and wrote several stage plays. From the very start, his approach to social sciences was integrative and comparative. Thus, among his early historical writings are two comparative histories and a series of works on China which gradually focused more and more on the distinct particularities of Chinese society. Beyond his immediate interest in concrete socio-historical research, Wittfogel wanted to establish historical materialism as <em>the</em> science of history and supplant the works of theoretically “bourgeois” and politically right-wing German social scientists like Max Weber (a liberal) and Werner Sombart (a Nazi).</p> <p>It is interesting to note that in Wittfogel’s works from the 1920s, some of his theoretical formulations approach those of the great Russian Marxist theorist Isaak Illich Rubin or the German “New Reading of Marx” developed in the 1960s and 70s. For example, in his book <em>Die Geschichte der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft</em>, which, as the title suggests, is a history of (early) capitalism, he explains that his method for the book is to combine an explanation the “systematic-logical” economic categories of capitalism (as described by Marx) with a “class-history” of capitalism. He describes value as a “social relation” that coordinates the social production of separated and competing individual producers, praises Lukács’s <em>History and Class Consciousness</em> as one of the best recent works of Marxist theory, etc. The focus on class struggle and social relations contrasts very strongly with his later work. I bring this all up just so you understand that when Wittfogel dismisses Lukács as idealist, for example, he does not do this out of simple ignorance. We can still detect some traces of this period of “proletarian science” in Wittfogel’s critiques of geopolitical theory and bourgeois geographical materialism—he says bourgeois geographical materialism was flawed because the social position of the bourgeoisie led them to epistemic and scientific quagmires, whereas the standpoint of the proletariat allows a correct epistemic starting point for true materialism.</p> <p>Wittfogel’s outlook on historical materialism fundamentally changed after he read the works of the famous Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov. Plekhanov had emphasized natural and (especially) geographical factors to an unprecedented extent in his writings. This approach strongly resonated with Wittfogel, perhaps because it allowed him to use geographical factors to explain the different developmental trajectories that emerged in world history.</p> <p>Wittfogel’s new, Plekhanov-influenced version of historical materialism was first introduced in the first reading for today, the essay “Geopolitics, Geographical Materialism, and Marxism” from 1929. This essay was occasioned, as the title suggests, by the recent upsurge in geographical and “geopolitical” writing among both revisionist socialists (Horrabin, Graf) and far-right reactionaries (Haushofer, who was massively influential on the Nazis). According to Wittfogel, all “geopoliticians” new and old are characterized by “the combination of an ineffectual geographical materialism with a completely unfounded eclecticism.” They all combine idealist speculation on things like national spirit and The State with a stupid geographical materialism that can only analyze things based on their immediate appearance. The “geopoliticians” universally ignore the economy, the process of production, and the labor process—i.e., the real media by which nature exerts its influence on society.</p> <p>Eventually Wittfogel begins outlining his own theory. At this point I am going to turn to reconstructively summarizing his theory as given in the two readings. Because these writings are rather obscure, and one is being translated for the first time, I am focusing on summarizing and explaining, not evaluation. We’re going to start with his account of the labor process and then go into his theory of nature.</p> <p>Wittfogel sometimes calls the social labor process the “fundamental relation” [grundlegende Verhaltnis] (GGMM 41 et passim). The labor process is “fundamental” in the sense that it <em>is</em> the metabolic relation between humanity and non-human nature. As far as I know, Wittfogel was one of very few people who picked up on Marx’s concept of “metabolism” (Stoffwechsel) at this time; he also took up Marx’s interest in soil. Anyway, there are three components to the labor process: labor power, objects of labor, and means of labor—these are also the three main productive forces in society. I will treat them in the order just given.</p> <p>Labor power, like the other two components, has a social side and a natural side. The social side is the <strong><em>organization and qualification</em></strong> <strong>of labor power</strong>, i.e. the technique of individual work and the technical division of labor. In general, this is the <strong><em>application of knowledge</em></strong> <strong>or <em>science</em></strong><em>.</em> The natural side consists in “<strong>physiological characteristics, race, [and] national character.</strong>” The first is simple enough: the strength and endurance of the workers, but the latter two require a brief digression. <br/> Wittfogel, like Marx and Engels, was a believer in racial science. Indeed, his 800 page monograph on the economy and society of China begins with an investigation into the racial characteristics of the Chinese. It must be understood that his conception of racial science was rather unique. He was—like Trofim Lysenko—a Lamarckian, meaning he rejected Darwin’s theories and believed that acquired characteristics could be inherited. This in turn meant that racial differences could and would eventually be negated by the egalitarianism of socialist society. Despite his defense of race science, he still insisted that race was ultimately not that important and can pretty much be disregarded in historical analysis.</p> <p>So much for labor power. The <strong>objects of labor</strong> are very simple. Either they are <strong>natural materials or natural objects of labor</strong> (wild animals and plants, minerals, etc.) or they are <strong>“raw materials,”</strong> i.e. objects that have already been transformed by labor (domesticated organisms, pig iron, cloth, fibers, etc.) (GGMM 43). Wittfogel has an interesting argument that extractively sourced natural materials play a very important role in early hunter-gatherer society and industrial capitalism, but are relatively less important in agrarian forms of society (feudalism, “asiatic society,”) (GGMM, 46). The argument has significant plausibility when one considers how much labor in medieval times was based around lumber from cultivated and managed forests, domesticated animals and plants, products sourced from those animals and plants, and so on. Ultimately I am not knowledgeable enough to evaluate it, however.</p> <p>Now I turn to the <strong>means of labor</strong>. It is in relation to this topic that some of Wittfogel’s characteristic novel ideas emerge. Wittfogel’s opponents (in this case, Gorter and Cunow) reduce the means of labor to mere <em>technology</em> (maybe having an allowance for draft animals), and thus ignore the importance of <strong><em>natural means of labor</em></strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>Soil</strong> is a natural means of labor in agriculture; it is the medium by which seeds become plants. <strong>Water</strong> is a natural means of labor in fishing, aquaculture, agriculture, and the use of mills and turbines. Wittfogel notes, however, that the use of these means of labor often requires tools—hoes, spears, nets, shovels, etc. Moreover, they are modified by human labor (soil depletion, salinization, overfishing, etc.) Thus the natural means of labor, although they are decisively <em>not</em> a product of humanity, nonetheless have a distinctively <em>historical character</em>, <em>as do all naturally conditioned productive forces.</em></p> <p>Wittfogel introduced two concepts to elucidate the <em>historical character</em> of <em>naturally conditioned productive forces</em>, i.e. nature insofar as it is socio-economically relevant. He claims that QUOTE, “Industry and the state of society “produce” the natural environment in a twofold manner, firstly through <em>transformation</em>, secondly through the <em>actualization</em> of essential aspects of nature.” Transformation is “the immediate result of labor-activity;” it is the physical change in nature as a result of human action. Actualization (or de-actualization) is the process by which parts of nature QUOTE “take on relevance to man as a result of a change of standpoint occurring in the labor process.” For Wittfogel, transformation takes absolute priority; actualization requires transformation but not vice versa. Great revolutions in the mode of production—the invention of agriculture, stockpiling, whatever—begin a process of <em>maturation</em> in the new mode of production. This process of maturation leads—a bit too naturally in my opinion—to the <em>actualization</em> of new parts of nature via the novel <em>transformations</em> of nature that it calls forth. Within this historical pattern and within the labor process, nature is “passive” and humanity is “active.” Nature sets conditions, establishes laws, provides a “larder” of materials, and so on, while humanity transforms these materials within the bounds of the conditions and laws established by nature. In the final analysis, we must always remember that everything comes from nature and is ultimately “natural” — although, as I will discuss later, I sometimes find that Wittfogel <em>does</em> forget this fundamental fact.</p> <p>Turning back to history, stagnation in development presents some problems. For Wittfogel, stagnation means a problem with the productive forces, and hence with nature in the last instance. Either there are simply no new natural productive forces to exploit (what about trade?) or the new productive forces are in conflict with the existing mode of production (this sounds like a social problem to me!). As you can probably tell, I am pretty skeptical of Wittfogel’s position here. At his most extreme, Wittfogel uses this principle to deduce the entire historical trajectory of Asia from some elementary facts about the soil and climate of China: the climate lead to irrigation agriculture, which produced an irrigation bureaucracy, and this bureaucracy violently prevented the development of the “germ cells” of capitalism, of bourgeois class power, because they threatened the “central nervous system” of the irrigation economy. (NUWg 607-8).</p> <p>This is the famous (or infamous) <em>geographical</em> aspect of Wittfogel’s historical materialism. If you consult a text written a few years after our readings called “Theorie der orientalischen Gesellschaft” (The Theory of Oriental Society—it’s from 1938) you will find comparative tables that predict what kind of mode of production (nomadism, irrigation agriculture, rainfall agriculture) will develop based entirely on what sorts of water are available (rain, rivers, etc.). While each of these modes of production implies a distinctive class structure, their historical trajectory has no immediately apparent relation to class struggle. (The charts from that text contrast very strongly with similar comparative history charts from 1924’s <em>Geschichte der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft</em>; the latter are focused strongly on the outcome of <em>class struggles</em> and the relations of production more generally.) Ultimately, however, Wittfogel must appeal to class struggle and relations of production to explain why, for example, China and Japan (I would also add Korea) developed very differently from one another (see GGMM pp. 56-7).</p> <p>One may object that the development of technology abolishes dependence on nature in all forms. Wittfogel strongly disagrees, saying that “The significance of the natural factors grows together with the social conditions (force) of the process of production” (GGMM 47). “The dependence on natural conditions” does “[assume] an increasingly mediated character,” (GGMM 47), but the dependence remains, especially when it comes to raw materials. I do not object to that point, but the difference between “<em>dependence</em> on nature” or “<em>conditioning</em> by nature” and “<em>determination</em> by geography” becomes very apparent when we consider the possibilities created by technology. I think these are two fundamentally different forms of ‘determination’ (or whatever you want to call it) that relate to different <em>periods</em>, i.e. <em>different modes of production</em>. Referencing Plekhanov, he claims it would be “a blatant error to mistake the change of <em>form</em> for a <em>cessation</em> of the effects of the natural factor,” but he does not theorize these forms.</p> <p>Wittfogel squirmed away from this difference by appealing to the monopolization of raw materials that results from imperialist conquest—now he could still readily identify nation-states with certain raw materials and geographical resources. But consider a modern country like South Korea, which has a large manufacturing sector, produces essentially none of its own raw materials (it is the 3rd largest importer of metals in the world), and has no imperialist holdings. Clearly the extent of geographical determination has lessened considerably due to advancements in transport, technology, and global trade relations. Korea even uses irrigation agriculture! Clearly Wittfogel’s theory has some glaring problems vis-a-vis geography.</p> <p>The ‘other’ side of his account of nature also has some problems. For one, there is a distinct lack of reflexivity—where does this view of ‘passive’ nature come from? For whatever reason, Wittfogel did not feel compelled to justify this dualist, vaguely Aristotelian approach. The schematic division between natural and social components in the Geographical materialism paper is somewhat confounding. Only the rawest aspects of nature are “natural;” if I understand him correctly, domesticated organisms are a social element, not a natural one (or at least they are more social than natural). His treatment of so-called ‘human nature,’ or the ‘biological’ aspect of human existence is also lacking. There is no mention of evolution, probably because Wittfogel did not even believe in Darwinian evolution. This results in blindspots regarding the origins of tool use, the earliest kinds of technology, and the emergence of homo sapiens as a singular species on Earth more generally. Engels was already ahead of Wittfogel with his fragment on the role of tools in human evolution.</p> <p>I find further problems in Wittfogel’s definition of a mode of production. According to him, it is “the unity of material and personal productive forces in the entire concrete process of production [Gesamtproduktionsprozess] of a determinate epoche of society.” First of all, the definition is circular because elsewhere he defines epochs of society <em>as historical modes of production</em>. Where does this excess ‘epochal differentiation’ come from? The obvious answer is, of course, the relations of production and the superstructure. The process of production always entails the relations of production. What the Althusserians called the <em>technical relations of production</em> is called the <em>organization of labor-power</em> by Wittfogel, obscuring its social aspect. The way in which Wittfogel divides up the mode of production from the relations of production seems to me artificial and invalid. Recall the previously mentioned argument about the irrigation <em>bureaucracy</em> in China—that whole situation is a showcase of the social relations of production and the effects of the superstructure (the State) on the economic base via class struggle!</p> <p>“The structure of the contemporaneously active productive forces as a whole,” Wittfogel writes, “determines the economic structure of a historical epoch.” He adds that “This structure, however, is unified [faßt sich … zusammen] in the mode of production.” Due to the lack of any explanation, this ‘unification’ appears in his theory as something both totally <em>automatic</em> and totally <em>simple</em>. It is unclear <em>why</em> there is any unity at all, especially given the circularity of the definition. How is it unified in <em>historical time</em>? If it is a unity, then what does it mean for there to be a <em>conflict</em> between emergent and dominant modes of production? Wittfogel offers us no answers to these questions.</p> <p>Allow me to digress for a moment. It must be understood that Wittfogel’s view that mode of production more or less equals forces of production was not exactly orthodox, even for the time. We all know that Marx’s use of the term was inconsistent to say the least, so it was up to later Marxists to fix a definition. Bukharin, in stark contrast to Wittfogel, defined the mode of production as “the totality of the production relations;” it was only “<em>determined</em> by the development of the productive forces;” it did not <em>consist</em> of these forces. Kautsky, on the other hand, had a more expansive definition; he defined the mode of production with reference to the <em>totality</em> of socially connected labor processes, as the <em>nature</em> of the <em>overall</em> process of production including both its social and technical sides. Other authors (Lukács, Rubin, etc.) did not provide a formal definition for the concept of the mode of production, but tended to focus heavily on the ‘social side’ of things. Cunow commented that many considered the term synonymous with a technical description of the labor process. Ultimately, the definition found in Stalin’s 1938 pamphlet <em>Dialectical and Historical Materialism</em> (unity of forces and relations of production) became by far the most influential. (Honestly, Stalin’s definition is not bad as a starting point.) One of the greatest contemporary Marxist theoreticians, Jairus Banaji, has drawn attention to the concept of “laws of motion” in relation to the delineation of modes of production; I think this concept has great potential to connect with Wittfogel’s ideas of actualization and different views of nature. Etienne Balibar’s essay “The Basic Concepts of Historical Materialism” in <em>Reading Capital</em> also provides an interesting contrast, and perhaps correction, to Wittfogel’s theory.</p> <p>I’m not going to conclude with a summary of Wittfogel’s views, instead I’m going to say one good thing about Wittfogel’s theory and then a criticism of it.</p> <p><strong>On one hand</strong>, Wittfogel rightly gave nature a place in his theoretical constructions and invented new and compelling concepts to understand humanity’s changing relationship with nature.<br/> <strong>On the other hand</strong>, he made nature into the master of history and neglected social relations.<br/> <strong>On one hand,</strong> Wittfogel drew up a systematic presentation of the process of production and correctly recognized that nature was used as a ‘tool’ just like man-made technology.<br/> <strong>On the other hand,</strong> his analysis basically stopped at the process of production.<br/> I could go on like this for a while, but I hope you get the point.</p> <h2 id="translation">Translation</h2> <p>[Karl Wittfogel, “Die natürlichen Ursachen der Wirtschaftsgeschichte,” in: Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, 67 (1932), 466–492; 597-609; 711-731.]</p> <h2 id="2-nature-and-society-in-the-marxian-system">2.

Though within the labor process man may place a potentially gigantic apparatus of means of labor between himself and the object of his labor, the object of labor always remains nature itself. “Man and his labor on one side, nature and its materials on the other;” that is the most universal fundamental relation [Grundbeziehung] in the process of social labor, like this itself “an eternal natural condition of human life independent of every form of this life, but rather common to all social forms.”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> However, this means, just as Hegel already declared, that man, despite all the “power” over external nature that tools lend him, is “subjugated” by nature in the determination of his aims.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Lenin expressed this in his materialist commentary on Hegel’s <em>Logic</em> thusly: “The laws of the external world, of nature, which are divided into mechanical and chemical (this is very important) are the bases of man’s purposive activity.

Natural and Social Productive Forces</h3> <p>The development of the social labor process, as the foundation of total social development, is the development of the <em>productive forces</em> that determine the character and efficacy of the labor process. Although [they are] historically conditioned as a collective, the productive forces do not all carry a social character in a <em>strict</em> sense. Two groups of productives forces function together in the labor process: produced and <em>not produced</em>, <em>socially</em> conditioned and <em>naturally</em> conditioned.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> All naturally conditioned (natural) productive forces have a <em>historical</em> character [Beschaffenheit]; only under certain historical circumstances do they become active [wirksam].

In the configuration of the “leading” means of his labor as well as in the realized social labor-activity that accompanies it, man depends on the “external world, nature” and “lets his activity be determined by it.” The laws of this external, natural world form “the foundation of purposive human activity.”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Marxistically [speaking], such a determinacy [Bestimmtheit] can only mean the determinacy of the path of development [Entwicklungsganges]. The <em>course</em> [Werden] of the social productive forces, centrally that of its material core, i.e. technology, is determined by the structure of the present moment in nature.</p> <p>In this sense Plekhanov explains—although admittedly with less precision than Marx and Lenin, since he, like most Marxists, did not adopt the concept of natural productives forces from Marx—that “the development of the productive forces, which in the last instance determine the development of all social relations, are themselves determined by the character of the geographical natural conditions.”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p> <p>We follow Marx’s distinction, which among Marxists Lenin was almost alone in accepting.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> By differentiating the thought put forward by Plekhanov, by tracing this thought back to Marx’s own conception, we can say that nature and society, the natural and social productive forces, “execute fundamentally different functions. Man and his social labor-activity represent the principle of unrest, of movement; nature (original or modified), the objective substratum which directs (or fails to direct) this activity in a definite direction through its material structure. Although man has an active relation to nature through the social labor process, at any given stage of the social forces of production he can only organize his activity in accordance with the natural means of labor and natural objects of labor he has plucked from the earth. Which naturally conditioned elements are “tapped” by socially-laboring man is above all determined by the totality of the socially developed forces of production (labor skills, science and its technological applicability, the organization of labor, the volume and efficacy of produced means of production). But the direction of the change in the social form of the process of labor (and whether there is a change at all) is not dependent on the arbitrary will of productive man but on the type, wealth and combination of the naturally conditioned forces of production socially “available” at any given time.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p> <p>“Motive [bewegend] activity and passive determination of direction;”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> these are the two essentially different functions that are performed by the two fundamental elements of the social labor process within every social formation.

But the principle, as well as the philological side of the question, should be clear. Marx, the dialectical materialist, saw the social labor process as proceeding in dependence upon its ultimate substrate, i.e. nature. This is where it is decided whether and in what direction changes in the labor process come about. Hence, the significance [definition?] of naturally conditioned productive forces. Hence the significance of the mode of production as the unity of all the productive forces, both the active, social side and the passive, direction-giving, natural side. No free will. No arbitrary choice [Willkür] in the development of material production. It is this, his materialist intransigence, that prompted Marx to designate the great epochs of production as the great historical <em>modes</em> of production (and not <em>relations</em> of production).</p> <p>The labor-technical structure [Gliederung] of an epoch, that is its material foundation. It is out of this [foundation] that the basic structure of society grows. The famous formula found in <em>The Poverty of Philosophy</em> (“The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill society with the industrial capitalist”<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>) may emphasize the individual means of production too strongly; the Marx of <em>Capital</em>, using a different starting point, may argue that it is the multiplicity of material conditions of production that is decisive, not an individual moment;<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> but this does not mean that one moment cannot play a particularly important role. The core materialist thought is not destroyed through these and similar, later remarks, rather only refined and made firm.</p> <p>“It is not what is made but how, and by what instruments of labour, that distinguishes different economic epochs.”<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> This thesis stands in the center of Marx’s magnum opus, the first volume of <em>Capital</em>. Since Marx included natural means of labor in [the category of] unproductive means of labor, he could assert his thesis without any “clarifying” additions of the kind that Kautsky believed he had to add to the apology for his poorly understood [version of] Marx.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> In this context [Zusammenhang], we once again recall [vergegenwärtige] Marx’s observations about the “<em>difference between different modes of production based on different means of production</em>” with the significant addition: “the connection between the social relations of production and those modes of production” (I, S. 345). The structure of the contemporaneously [jeweils] active productive forces as a whole determines the economic structure of a historical epoch. This structure, however, is unified [faßt sich … zusammen] in the mode of production.</p> <p>An economic-historical analysis that does not undermine the power—which is always emphasized even by non-Marxists—of Marx’s scientific tools,<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> but rather makes full use of them, cannot be satisfied with the approach [centered around the] <em>relations</em> of production. <em>The mode of production must first be laid bare</em>. So long as this path is not taken, we lack a true Marxist procedure, and instead only have an approximation at best.</p> <p>First of all, the mode of production! Within it, however, the naturally conditioned element of the productive forces must be fully illuminated. “All historical writing must set out from these natural bases and their modification in the course of history through the action of men.”<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> Will shall see what this means for the concrete construction of an economic-social history of man.</p> <h2 id="3-stagnation-and-development-in-humanitys-material-production">3.

Kautsky claims in his late work that “the meaning of technology and economy for the historical process is more decisive than that of nature.” Those moments would therefore be “more important for humanity … than these [i.e. nature],” because “those that form the <em>variable</em> element in the human environment, whereas nature, in contrast to human society, represented a relatively constant, unalterable element.”<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> It is this fixed conception of the relation between man and nature that either leads to a mechanical naturalism<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> or, in a false reaction to a false presupposition, to a backslide into an idealistic postulation of free will.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> The dialectical emphasis on the activity of laboring man as well as the reference to the repercussions [Rückwirkung] of this activity on the natural substrate eliminate the apparent weakness. The historically relevant nature in question, which scarcely changes in the course of human history without human intervention, nevertheless does not simply become, as Kautsky says, ever more manipulable by more developed technology.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> [Rather,] nature itself changes in the process of [its] interplay with socially laboring man. And so Feuerbach, according to Marx and Engels’ polemic that just as easily could have been directed at Kautsky, “[did] not see that the sensuous world around him is not a thing given direct from all eternity, remaining ever the same, but the product of industry and of the state of society.”<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p> <p>Industry and the state of society “produce” the natural environment in a twofold manner, firstly through <em>transformation</em>, secondly through the <em>actualization</em> [Aktualisierung] of essential aspects of nature.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> There is a distinction between the two forms of change, a distinction that does not eliminate the frequent (but not necessary) connection between them. <em>Transformation</em> of nature is the <em>immediate result of the labor-activity</em> of productive man: creation of an artificial steppe, artificial swamps (irrigation), cultivation of specific types of animals and plants (and the extermination of others), creation of new waterways, depletion of farmland or natural resources, fabrication of an artificial climate, etc., etc. <em>Actualization</em> (or <em>de-actualization</em>) of specific parts or properties of nature includes moments that take on relevance to man as a result of a <em>change of standpoint</em> [Standpunkänderung] occurring in the labor process, or which cease to be important for the process of production on these grounds. Accordingly, there can be no talk of those moments in nature that are essential for the human labor process remaining ever the same. In [certain] periods of history, nature (the cosmos) may undergo relatively little change in its total structure. In relation to socially laboring <em>man</em>, [nature] changes in a radical way [only] insofar as development occurs.</p> <p><em>Insofar</em> as development occurs. Indeed, there is no actualization of new naturally conditioned productive forces without a preceding transformation of elements of nature. The reverse does not hold true. <em>Not every transformation leads to actualization of new moments of nature</em>. The great problem of stationary economic orders emerges here. Australia, Africa, the East Indies, the great oriental cultural zone—all these historical complexes show us organisms of production, which, after a [period] of more or less prosperous development and with certain exceptions got into a position in which they still <em>transformed</em> [nature], but <em>actualized</em> no or almost no essentially new elements of nature. A universal economic history of humanity will have to assert that the greater part of the earth’s population belongs to a stationary sphere of life [Lebenskreis] (or belonged to one, in any case). These stagnating organisms of production were first propelled into new development by the only place where a breakthrough into industrial capitalism took place, Europe. Thus, it falls to economic history to explain not merely the <em>development</em> of different economic complexes, but also the incidents of halted development, of stagnation, which are no less important for the full historical picture.</p> <p>Not every transformation of natural matter into human use-value leads to the exploitation of new natural forces or makes new aspects of nature relevant [aktuell] for the labor process. Without the social process of production, whatever stage it may achieve, there is no actualization. Labor alone, however, is not sufficient. Labor must contain the possibility of a corresponding novel kind of activity [Betätigung]. Where this does not obtain, the process of production remains in the same spot. [In this case, then,] there is no development, merely repetition. Historically seen, there is stagnation.</p> <p>A unit of social life [gesellschaftliche Lebenseinheit] reaches a determinate stage of production: that of hunting and gathering, animal husbandry, agriculture. The beginning of activity in a new mode of production obviously cannot be one of complete utilization; a period of <em>maturation</em> follows. Either this maturation is realized in such a way that it merely advances to the exploitation of qualitatively similar elements and thus the quantitative advance does not reach the threshold of a novel quale [Quale]. This is the process that Müller-Lyer has given the name “lateral development.”<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> Or, the [process of] maturation makes the transition to essentially new elements possible. We could call this “vertical development,” a [kind of] development in the strict and genuine sense. In the second case, it succeeds in putting new natural forces in the service of production, be it the ability to produce animals and plants or mechanical or chemical properties of industrially useful materials. But, when is this <em>not</em> possible?</p> <p>I. The process of maturation stays stuck—and this goes for any stage [of development]—in lateral development because new naturally conditioned productive forces, on the basis of which the social productive forces could develop, are not available.</p> <p>II. Alternatively, new natural forces are available, but they were ‘tapped’ [erschlossen] under different circumstances [and under] another mode of production. [This] shows that they [the natural forces] <em>cannot be actualized</em> due to [the] totally determined structure of the productive forces of the achieved mode of production. This may (A) be grounded in the structure of the heretofore dominant kind of production [Produktionsart] itself (e.g. in the particularities of the slave-driven agricultural economy of late antiquity) or it may (B) have its cause in the specific antagonistic relations between the heretofore dominant and emerging spheres of production (a problem in the development of industrial capitalism in the womb of the great agrarian societies of Asia). Concrete historical research will have to determine which of these cases (I or II; A or B) it is dealing with.</p> <p>The metabolic process of historically determined social labor leads, in its transformation of nature, to the exploitation of new sides (properties) of nature, and if the qualitatively novel [element] is, firstly, essential for the modification of the labor process, and if it is, secondly, available not only haphazardly, but rather in general extent, then <em>a new view of nature</em> results for man, who is stimulated to new needs and sees new possibilities for production and consumption. Nature shows itself to man “from a new side.” After primitive groups took hold of fire, whether this was the result of a lightning strike, flowing lava, or, less possibly, an unforeseen side effect of drilling activity<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> [e.g. with a bow drill -J.E.M.], wholly new aspects of nature—wood as fuel, certain constellations of terrain protecting fires—became relevant [aktuell].</p> <p>After certain activities of a maturing hunter-gatherer economy [Sammelwirtschaft]—stockpiling, for example—led to understanding the possibility of conscious reproduction of useful plants, moments which were heretofore more or less irrelevant to man [working in the] new style of production (soil quality, the cultivability of certain plants) came to the foreground of his interests, his transformative social labor. The same procedure is repeated in the transition to animal husbandry, to artificial irrigation. Primitive tillage grows into use of the water supply. Success stabilizes need. From this point in time onwards, the structure of nature is revolutionized (not “in itself,” but for the [purposes] of laboring man at this stage). Rain, waterways, wind systems, and groundwater now take on a startlingly new utility for the sphere of life [Lebenskreis] of agricultural producers. A stream, which was previously taken as something neutral if not hostile, is now sought after, carefully observed, and taken into service. The actualization of rivers and seas for water transportation is one of the few significant examples in economic and cultural geography to emerge from the “sphere of commerce.” The maturation of textile work up to the point of wool spinning and weaving did not only depend on certain species of animals, but also on the land appropriate for their reproduction. The history of England and Spain shows what this actualization of arable land as sheep-runs could mean economically. The industrial history of the last century is the history of the general actualization of coal and a partial de- and re-actualization of iron (England) in connection with the decline of wood smelting and transition to coal-based ironworking. The maturation of mechanical-electrical energy production has made moving water relevant (watermills), irrelevant (steam engines), and relevant once again ([hydroelectric] turbines). Thus nothing is more false than the claim that nature stays ever the same, a constant factor, in the course of economic history. It changes, at least in simple ways, and even in multifaceted ways as development occurs. The fundamental relation is newly shaped by these changes stemming from the activity of laboring man, but is never abolished. No free will, not even for technically, productively active man. He may transform the landscape on his journey through the mountains. He may confront new tasks and prospects with every step of the path blasted into the cliffs. [But,] his path must adapt to the “passive” structure of the mountain. And he takes flight not from [the power of] his free will, but in compliance with new, deeper, and more complicated structural laws of nature. That is the dialectical, materialist theory of the Marxian conception of history.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>S. 472-481. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>W.

Vor allem II, S. 148 ff. In seinen ethnologischen Schriften arbeitet Cunow nicht mit dem Begriff der Produktionsweise. Vgl. etwa: Die Verwandtschaftsorganisation der Australneger, Stuttgart 1894. Die soziale Verfassung des Inkareichs. Stuttgart 1896. (Hier wird zwar die agrikole Produktionsweise der Inkagesellschaft beschrieben, aber erst im 5. Kapitel, S. 72 ff. und ohne den Versuch einer Ableitung der gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse aus der Produktionsweise.) Ähnlich auch: Ursprung der Religion und des Gottesglaubens, Berlin 1913. Von der Produktionsweise der Gruppen und Stämme, die Cunow auf ihre religiösen Vorstellungen hin untersucht, ist stets nur nebenbei, wenn überhaupt die Rede. Sehr viel stärker hebt Cunow die Naturbeziehungen als Grundlage wirtschaftlicher Entwicklung hervor in seiner Allgemeinen Wirtschaftsgeschichte. I—III, Berlin 1926 ff.; freilich nur für das Wirtschaftsleben der Primitiven. Auch hier folgt er jedoch nicht den Marxschen Kategorien, was zur Folge hat, daß selbst da, wo der das Naturmoment berücksichtigt, dies in einer chaotischen Weise geschieht, nicht viel anders, als die alten geographischen Materialisten es, soweit sie das Wirtschaftliche heranzogen, auch getan haben. So stellt Cunow die Frage nach dem Warum der Stagnation der Australneger überhaupt nicht (I, S. 77 ff.). Bei Behandlung der Jägervölker Nordamerikas sieht er nur ihren Reichtum an L e b e n s mitteln (I, S. 169 ff. und 227 ff.). Die von Marx sofort mitgestellte Frage nach den natürlichen Grundlagen der A r b e i t s mittel — hier: Steine, im Gegensatz zu Südamerika — gliedert er seiner Fragestellung nicht ein. Ganz im Sinne der alten geographischen Materialisten tritt bei Cunow bei der Untersuchung höherer Gesellschaftsformen das Problem der Naturgrundlage ihrer Entwicklung mehr und mehr zurück. Bei der Perukultur wird die Erwähnung der Naturgrundlagen der Bewässerungswirtschaft und die Schilderung dieser Wirtschaft selbst der Darstellung der sozialen Ordnung — der Mark — angehängt (I, S. 293 ff.). Bei Analyse der römischen Agrarentwicklung, einschließlich der Sklavenlandwirtschaft, bei Untersuchung der altindischen Agrarverhältnisse oder bei Beschreibung der industriellen Entwicklung Englands ist von den Naturgrundlagen so gut wie gar nicht mehr die Rede (II, S. 56, 27 ff., 32; III, S. 449, 472, 479). Im Falle England führt dieses sein Verfahren Cunow zu handgreiflichen Ungenauigkeiten, im Falle Indien zu einer völligen Fehlanalyse. <a href="#fnref:18" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:19"> <p>K.

Einer klaren Stellungnahme zu den entscheidenden Thesen Marxens wird in beiden Fällen aus dem Wege gegangen. Daß Kautsky im Grunde der Meinung war, Marxens Auffassung sei eine technizistische, läßt sich aus dem Umstände schließen, daß er in seinem Vorwort zu Gorters Schrift über den historischen Materialismus (deutsch, Stuttgart 1919) mit keinem Worte gegen Gorters technizistische Darstellung des historischen Materialismus Verwahrung einlegt. Gegen die Gleichsetzung von Produktionsweise und Technik, wie sie sich bei Gorter findet, hat Cunow mit Recht Einspruch erhoben (a. a. O.

Wir erinnern an Troeltschs Annäherung an die Grundformel des historischen Materialismus (Der Historismus und seine Probleme, Tübingen 1922, etwa S. 344 ff. und 756). Wir erinnern schließlich an Sombarts Vorwort zum III.

O. S. 133). Nebensätze solcher Art sind nun gewiß sehr bezeichnend dafür, daß ein Theoretiker die Unrichtigkeit seiner Position fühlt, doch genügen sie natürlich nicht, die in den Hauptsätzen aufgestellte, den ganzen Gedankengang tragende falsche technizistische These aufzuheben. <a href="#fnref:53" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:54"> <p>Kautsky a. a.

Oktober 1866 (Briefwechsel, Ausgabe Rjazanov, III, S. 361). Hier wird speziell auch das Moment der Aktualisierung hervorgehoben.

Auch wenn die Zähnung des Feuers nicht unmittelbar aus dem Produktionsprozeß hervorgewachsen sein sollte, wie das die Kuhnsche Theorie annahm, bleibt die Tatsache bestehen, daß das Feuer erst auf einer ganz bestimmten Stufe der gesellschaftlichen Produktion für den Menschen aktuell geworden ist. Die Einbeziehung des Feuers ist unbedingt als Akt der Ausreifung der vorher erreichten Produktionsweise anzusehen. <a href="#fnref:58" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:59"> <p>Der Kulturgeograph muß, wo er konkret denkt, dieser Konzeption sich anschließen. So betont Ratzel mit allem Recht, “daß der Unterschied zwischen Natur- und Kulturvolk nicht in dem Grade, sondern in der Art dieses Zusammenhangs mit der Natur zu suchen ist. Die Kultur ist Naturfreiheit nicht im Sinne der völligen Loslösung, sondern in dem der vielfältigen weiteren und breiteren Verbindung . . . Wir werden nicht von der Natur im ganzen freier, indem wir sie eingehender ausbeuten ud studieren, wir machen uns nur von einzelnen Zufällen vervielfältigen” (Anthropogeographie, 4. Aufl. Stuttgart 1921, I, S. 41). Unsere hier bekundete Übereinstemmuing mit einem Gedanken Ratzels schließt eine kirtische Stellungnahme zu seinem geschichtsphilosphischen Gesamtsystem nicht aus (Vgl.

In section V of that essay, Adorno elaborates what would become the economic core of racket theory for the first generation of Frankfurt School critical theorists:<d-footnote>See J.E. Morain’s piece in this dossier, where he describes it as the second essential thesis of the racket theory problematic. </d-footnote></p> <blockquote> <p>In the market economy the untrue aspect of the concept of class was latent: in monopoly capitalism it has become as visible as its truth – the survival of classes – has become invisible. Competition and its struggles have led to the disappearance of much of the unity of the class,which previously held the competitors together in the form of the rules of the game and of common interests. It is so easy for the bourgeoisie to deny its own class character to the<br/> proletariat because in fact its organization has cast off the consensual form of like interests that had constituted it as a class in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has replaced this with the direct economic and political command of the large capitalists that used the same threat of the police against both their own supporters and the workers. This imposes on both sections of the population the same function and the same need, and it is this that makes it almost impossible for the workers to see that class relations are at work.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942) in *Can One Live After Auschwitz? A Philosophical Reader*, ed. Rolf Tiedemann (Stanford University Press, 2003)</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>This passage shows a number of characteristic features of the “microeconomic” approach critiqued by Milios and Sotiropoulos including:</p> <ol> <li>The temporal and conceptual division between “the market economy” and “monopoly capitalism,” which hinges on changes in the dominant form of enterprise to characterize the poles of its opposition.</li> <li>The claim that the competition of the market economy period has led to the disappearance of the previous unity of the bourgeois class, which took the form of rules of the game and common interests, and its implicit suggestion that there has been a fundamental change in the structural determinations or “laws” of the capitalist mode of production as a result of the above changes.</li> <li>The claim that this previous form of unity has been replaced by “the direct economic and political command of the large capitalists,” which further suggests that this postulated change involves the displacement of competition from the central role it had in Marx’s account as the primary form of appearance through which those structural determinations manifest themselves.</li> </ol> <p>These are the very features of a “micro-economic” approach that Milios and Sotiropoulos set out to discredit in Chapter 6 of their book <em>Rethinking Imperialism</em> by reconstructing the relevant arguments from volume III of <em>Capital</em>.<d-footnote>See Milios &amp; Sotiropoulos, *Rethinking Imperialism*, 115-120.</d-footnote> The most important point from that chapter is the recovery of Marx’s concept of social capital and its relation to competition. The authors show how, for Marx, it is competition that constitutes the various individual capitals existing within a social formation as parts of the total social capital through the formation of an average rate of profit. This is how the capitalist class is united as a class and how the unique structural determinations or “inner laws” that define the capitalist mode of production are made manifest. Therefore, the displacement of competition from its central position in regulating economic life would mean the elimination of the mechanism through which those determinations are realized, and so of the determinations as a whole, rather than just their transformation. It would mean an end to the capitalist mode of production as such, and thus also to the usefulness of Marx’s analysis of it.<d-footnote>Another way to think about this in terms of Adorno’s claim about the replacement of the former “rules of the game” by “direct economic and political command,” which would mean an end to the indirect forms of domination that distinguish capitalism from previous modes of production and discipline capitalists into acting as bearers of the capital relation.</d-footnote></p> <p>What does all this mean for racket theory? On the one hand, it seems clear to me that many of the phenomena Adorno and Horkheimer are trying to explain in terms of the rise of monopolies and the supposed elimination of competition that accompanies it—the increasing preponderance of relations of direct coercion reminiscent of pre-capitalist social relations, the decline of bourgeois individuality and the subjective autonomy that characterized it, the increasing integration of organized labor, and the working class more broadly, into the hierarchical organization of capitalist social forms—are real changes that require explanation. It also seems clear that key elements of their explanation—the changing character of the dominant form of capitalist enterprise, changes in the way competition is organized that entail, at the very least, a relative diminution of its prominence in a number of areas—also track real changes in the configuration of capitalist social relations during the 20th century. On the other hand, the intervention of Milios and Sotiropoulos leads me to conclude that those explanatory elements are themselves phenomena to be explained, and that this explanation must begin from the other direction, from the concept of social capital and its relation to the constitution of an average rate of profit out of intra and inter-sectoral competition (nationally and globally). I think many of the explanations offered by Adorno and Horkheimer will still be valuable to us as we move down from this level of abstraction, but they will also need to be reevaluated and reconfigured in the process.</p> <p>This means not only working out the intermediate mediations between the abstract level of social capital brought into focus by Milios and Sotiropoulos and the more concrete levels worked out by Adorno and Horkheimer, but also clarifying some of the questions left open by the austerity of the formers’ abstraction—questions surrounding the dialectical interplay between the competition (or relative lack thereof) at work in the formation of a sectoral average rate of profit and the competition involved in the formation of an inter-sectoral average rate of profit, how these play out differentially on the national and the world markets, and how they relate to the play of tendency and counter-tendency surrounding the organic composition of capital and the “circumstances which, independently of the proportional division of surplus value into capital and revenue, determine the extent of accumulation.”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Capital: A Critique of Political Economy*, vol. I, trans. Ben Fowkes (Penguin Classics, 1990), 747-761.</d-footnote> I could even see the development of a renewed monopoly capital framework as the outcome of this work, but one which is at once more structural and more dialectical, centered on the <em>tendency</em> towards the elimination of competition at a sectoral level and the way in which this very tendency gives birth to new and renewed competition in other areas, before itself succumbing to the forces of intra-sectoral competition in the sector(s) of its origin and shifting locations (but not losing its overall force as a tendency), although this remains only a possibility until the necessary work is done.<d-footnote>David Harvey’s analysis in *The Limits to Capital*, in particular in Chapter 5, “The Changing Organization of Capitalist Production,” where he develops a concept of an "equilibrium between the tendencies toward centralization and decentralization” may be useful in this regard, although his neglect of the concept of social capital and consequent underdevelopment of the role that the dialectical interaction of intra- and inter-sectoral competition play in the phenomena he analyzes would need to be corrected; Harvey, *The Limits to Capital*, 137-155.</d-footnote> We must return to Marx—to all three volumes of <em>Capital</em>—with these questions in mind, and at the same time we must turn to the working out of these dynamics at the level of class struggle in concrete contemporary social formations, a turn which remains a perpetual promissory note in the analysis of Milios and Sotiropoulos.<d-footnote>Alongside the problems mentioned here, Milios and Sotiropoulos’ analysis also runs into a number of other problems surrounding their methodological nationalism that are too complicated to get into here. I plan on addressing them in a follow-up piece dedicated specifically to that task.</d-footnote></p>]]></content><author><name>Mac Parker</name></author><category term="Racketology"/><category term="report"/><category term="write-up"/><category term="study"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Putting the Racket-concept to the Test]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Class and Rackets, Part II - Domination</title><link href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_part2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Class and Rackets, Part II - Domination"/><published>2025-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_part2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_part2/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post23-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post23-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post23-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post23.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="class-and-rackets-domination">Class and Rackets: Domination</h2> <p>In a short note, Horkheimer writes that “the basic form of domination is the racket.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist” in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 287.</d-footnote> During the early 20th century, the terms “racket” and “racketeering” were primarily associated with Chicago criminal gangs that arose during the early 20th century as a reaction to poverty amongst recent immigrants from Europe and the prohibition of alcohol. These gangs primarily consisted of a network of variegated criminals organized in a strict, paramilitary hierarchy.<d-footnote>James Schmidt, “‘Racket,’ ‘Monopoly,’ and the Dialectic of Enlightenment,” *Persistent Enlightenment*, January 2016; Andrew W. Cohen, “The Racketeer’s Progress: Commerce, Crime, and the Law in Chicaǵo, 1900-1940,” Journal of Urban History 29, no. 5 (July 2003): 575–96; Edward Granter, “Strictly Business: Critical Theory and the Society of Rackets,” Competition &amp; Change 21, no. 2 (April 2017): 94–113; Robert M. Lombardo, Organized Crime in Chicago: Beyond the Mafia, (University of Illinois Press, 2012), 149–167.</d-footnote> Through the efforts of anti-union propagandists, these terms came to be associated with (radical) union officials during the New Deal era, an attempt to hinder the extra-legal, “criminal” activities undertaken by unions for collective action.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> In this context, Kirchheimer points out that lawyers used to frame “racket” as the “monopolistic practices […] carried through by physical force” for “singling out particularly objectionable methods serves as a convenient tool for bringing the guilty to account and depriving them of the sympathies of the community at large”<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 159.</d-footnote> against who are deemed miscreants or criminals. In a critical re-appropriation of the term, Horkheimer generalizes the concept of the racket to encompass most groups with vested interests in the social reproduction of monopoly capitalism insofar as they directly or indirectly rely on personal domination and violence to sustain themselves. The <em>civilized</em> ruling class is revealed to have always consisted of various rackets, hidden in plain sight through its control over production and disciplinary mechanisms, unlike the racket of the criminal that represented “more irrational, more primitive racket relative to the state-protected class monopoly.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Theorie des Verbrechers” [1939-1942] in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 270</d-footnote> Hence, Kirchheimer points out that</p> <blockquote> <p>if there is a difference in methods as between”haves” and “have-nots,” firstcomers and latecomers, “decent citizens” and “racketeers,” there is no difference in their aims which are essentially the same: establishment of domination over a segment of the process of production or distribution.<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 130.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In a letter to Franz Neumann, Horkheimer posits that (unlike the civilized rackets) the petty criminal skips over the “stage of production and seeks to appropriate to himself as much of the circulating surplus value as possible,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Theorie des Verbrechers” [1939-1942] in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 269</d-footnote> the criminal is an affront to the false universality of capitalist society who doesn’t keep up appearances, hence questions the very essence of capitalism. The criminal is disciplined through punishment to internalize the norms of society as more subtle institutions of socialization failed to do its job.<d-footnote>Michel Foucault argues a similar point in *Discipline and Punish*. The early critical theorists recognize the non-identity between the goals of these institutions and the embodied individual that cannot be fully socialized as an object. There is room for mediated agency in their conception.</d-footnote> In stark resemblance to Pashukanis’ argument regarding the legal form, Horkheimer observes that legal domination acquires its own logic immanent to capitalist social relations; unlike primitive sanctions or feudal punishment, the criminal as ordained by the legal form “is the exponent of a conflict necessarily inherent in society itself.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Theorie des Verbrechers” [1939-1942] in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 266</d-footnote> Criminal law shields the ruling rackets from the excesses that are generated by capitalist society, as those who cannot adapt to existing conditions lash out against those who benefit the most. The existing conditions that crush and exclude those who fail to keep up with its demands is rationalized in society by the “halo of necessity.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and The Family,” 93.</d-footnote> Poverty and crime are hypostatized as a natural part of any society, and the idea that ‘some people will always be poor or bad’ is instilled to <em>civilized</em> citizens through the universalization of the legal form and its constitutive ideological apparatuses. The legal institution becomes a tool of the ruling rackets in monopoly society to exert violence on the individuals and expand its horizons; the ruling class as rackets “make use of their productive apparatus as robbers make use of their guns.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> <p>With monopoly capitalism, the combination of the rise of the relative surplus population with furthering integration of the circuits of capital into social life led to the development of “antagonisms within the ranks of the oppressed masses themselves.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Rather than forming a class united by shared oppression/exploitation, the workers and the excluded are incentivized to form antagonistic groups within themselves (as rackets) as a response to the monopolistic organization of society—hierarchically organized and self-interested groups attempt to gain as much of the available social surplus through direct domination and violence directed towards other groups, regardless of their social position. The intra-class conflict of rackets within the ruling class is universalized under the antagonistic conditions of integration and exclusion, the employed section of the workers (in the global north) and their hierarchical trade unions, for Adorno (and Horkheimer), “became monopolies” that “terrorized outsiders” to secure their relative position.<d-footnote>Adorno, *“*Reflections on Class Theory,” 100.</d-footnote> The labour aristocracy is reframed as racket.<d-footnote>In letters to Horkheimer, Franz Neumann and Herbert Marcuse pushed back against the argument that the working class has fully adapted to the monopolistic structures of society. Neumann in particular responds that only labour leaders (as managers) have been integrated into racket logic. For Horkheimer, however, the working class constitutes a conscious class rather than a racket only when it shares collective agency. (See Neumann’s letter to Horkheimer in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 17, 482-483.) In one draft of the “Sociology of Class Relations”, Horkheimer incorporates the criticism by adding the paragraph but ultimately removes it — “There are some decisive differences between Labor and capitalistic monopolies(…)The term Labor, however, comprises both the leaders who appropriate the profits and the members who create them. The same process which, both in reality and ideology, has made Labor an economic subject, has transformed the laborer, who was already the object of the entrepreneur, into the object of his organization as well(…) While the masses think of themselves as the creators of their own destiny, the leaders use them as a commodity. The fact that Labor is a monopoly does not mean that its members, labor aristocracy excepted, are monopolists.” (Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”)</d-footnote> The revolutionary working class struggle is replaced by hierarchical labour organizations that trade labour as a “merchandise, manipulate it, advertise it, and try to fix its price as high as possible.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> With hindsight, we can observe that even these labour organizations in the global north have been largely disintegrated with the total expansion of market rationality throughout the world. Rackets appear not as part of the integration of working class organizations as it did during the 40s but as the result of exclusion and pauperization that accompanies capitalist integration. The anti-Democratic reactionary movements appearing the across the world such as MAGA, and the militant Hindu religious movements in India are accompanied by the rise of surplus populations being appropriated by the ruling rackets, the “criminal” that previously aroused the spirits of ruling classes by attempting to mimic their actions is a tool to be instrumentally used and subsequently discarded.<d-footnote>In a letter to Horkheimer, Marcuse explicitly writes about the “harmony of interests between the union bureaucracy and the large monopolistic companies” and the “in some striking cases, the collaborationist attitude of the workers seems to be even stronger than that of the unions.” During the 1930’s lead to the “the famous Jack and Heintz factory in Cleveland (good article on it in the New Republic of Oct. 25), which is praised (also by the Communist Party) as paragon of the true relationships between workers. It is perhaps the most outstanding example of voluntary coordination of labor, and it shows how smoothly fascism can progress in a democratic environment.” (See Marcuse’s letter to Horkheimer in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 17, 476-477.)</d-footnote> Kirchheimer writes</p> <blockquote> <p>Racket connotes a society in which individuals have lost the belief that compensation for their individual efforts will result from the mere functioning of impersonal market agencies. But it keeps in equal distance from, and does not incorporate, the idea of a society wherein the antagonism between men and inanimate elements of production has been dissolved in the image of a free association for the common use of productive forces. It is the experience of an associational practice which implies that neither the individual’s choice of an association nor the aims that the latter pursues are the result of conscious acts belonging to the realm of human freedom.<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 161.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Society tends towards the formation of competing “pressure” groups as rackets that does not hesitate to use any means necessary to carve out a space for its own reproduction through the acquisition of the circulating surplus value as an adaptation to the conditions of monopolization. The intensification of the impersonal forms of control characteristic of capitalist society through the market and the legal form in-turn intensifies the forms of personal domination that highlighted pre-capitalist social organizations, traditional forms of domination such as caste are explicitly mobilized as rackets to navigate class society. Horkheimer claims the primary function of groups is to protect itself from outside aggression, and stabilize its own social position in society. Hence groups themselves maintain the conditions of social reproduction “in which they have favored standing; they uphold and violently ward off changes that could endanger their monopoly. They are rackets.”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist” in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 288</d-footnote> Durkheim’s false distinction between organic and mechanical solidarity collapses in-itself through racket logic, the division of labour organized through vast interconnected networks throughout society is maintained through personal relationships of domination in-and-between groups. What was purportedly in conflict with the forces of capitalism according to liberals was absorbed by capitalism for its continual expansion. As Horkheimer writes</p> <blockquote> <p>“Today the expression of human needs is distorted no longer by the dubious economic indicators of the market, but by their conscious molding in a giant system of socio-psychological surgery. The misery of unsuccessful competitors and of backward groups can no longer be ascribed to anonymous processes which permitted a distinction between them as economic subjects and as human beings. The downfall of vanquished opponents, competitors as well as whole social strata, minorities and nations, is decided upon by the elites.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>The elite theory of Vilfredo Pareto is reframed as racket formation particular to specific social conditions rather than the transhistorical determination of power relations as such. For the early critical theorists, elite sociology partially describes the social dynamics within modern society but fails to understand its causes, which leads to its reactionary conclusions.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, *Introduction to Sociology*, ed. Christoph Gödde, tr. Edmund Jephcott (Stanford University Press), 13–14.</d-footnote> The partial description of elites circulating at the top throughout history as democracies are eventually reduced to oligarchies are rather the descriptions of rackets competing amongst themselves for resources while imposing strict control over their subjects. Unlike Pareto’s transhistorical formulation of the relations of power, the concept of the racket leaves the possibility of a truly free and democratic society open through the dissolution of rackets through the formation of a political class.</p> <p>As James Schmidt points out, the language of rackets and monopoly were tactically removed from manuscripts that were eventually published as the <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> to escape censorship by American authorities. They resorted to an esoteric mode of communication to develop an immanent critique of enlightenment rationality as it arises with the development of capitalism, it is particularly illuminating to understand the concepts introduced in the <em>Dialectic</em> to understand the functioning of class domination, misogyny and racism in monopoly society.<d-footnote>Schmidt, “‘Racket,’ ‘Monopoly,’ and the Dialectic of Enlightenment,” and Eva-Maria Ziege, “The Irrationality of the Rational : The Frankfurt School and Its Theory of Society in the 1940s,” in *Antisemitism and the Constitution of Sociology* (University of Nebraska Press, 2014), 274–96.)</d-footnote> Their primary thesis that enlightenment and myth are deeply interrelated with enlightenment rationality (with the transition to capitalism) leading to a blind domination over nature, alongside the explicit integration of tradition with capitalism.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Fascism was the result of identification with the blind forces of the economic apparatus.</p> <p>Adorno and Horkheimer understand the return of mimesis in modernity as an adaptive response to the conditions of total integration of Capitalism with the domination of nature and eventually humanity.<d-footnote>Theodor W Adorno and Max Horkheimer, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, 2016, 148.</d-footnote> The impersonal forces of capitalism i.e. the dominance of the market and the formal equality of the legal form, which leads to identification with the inert functioning of the world with itself. For Freud, the death drive is the attempt to conquer (qua mastery over) death through a constant repetition of the actions that brings the individuals close to an inorganic state, a drive to kill a part of oneself and identify with the external functioning world to conquer death itself.<d-footnote>Sigmund Freud, *Beyond the Pleasure Principle: Group Psychology and Other Works ; (1920-1922)*, 38–55.</d-footnote> Like the death drive, mimicry in capitalism is an irrational repetition to control the irrationality of existing reality, hence</p> <blockquote> <p>“By echoing, repeating, imitating the surroundings, by adapting himself to all the powerful groups to which he belongs, by transforming himself from a human being into a member of specific organized bodies, by reducing his potentialities to readiness and ability to conform to, and gain influence in, such bodies, he can finally manage to survive. It is survival by practicing the oldest biological means of survival: mimicry. Modern culture is a resurrection of oppressed mimetic practices.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Apropos mimesis, Rackets are “pragmatic totalities,” hierarchical organizations that are pragmatically oriented towards the existing world that hypostatizes the existing conditions of social reproduction. Pragmatism, both in its commonsensical and philosophical sense “corresponds to limitless trust in the existing world” <d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, ed., “On the Problem of Truth,” in *Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings*, 192.</d-footnote> Elderly advice and the realism of international politics amounts to the same things—anything that challenges the current state of affairs is deemed as a childish tantrum that fails to understand reality. For Horkheimer, the masses understand their own economic situation but that (immediately) does not translate into revolutionary class consciousness but is sublimated into the blind acceptance of existing reality as pragmatic/realist decision making. The philosophy of pragmatism of William James and John Dewey as its primary representatives limits the conception to truth to corroboration of ideas with use, it ends with reifying concepts for their usefulness as posited by the existing state of affairs.<d-footnote>Ibid, 195.</d-footnote> The convergence of philosophical thinking and the rationality of groups as pragmatic totalities is a mimetic response to the impersonal forces of the market. For Adorno, this limitless trust qua pragmatism leads to the flattening of everything to easily identifiable and measurable categories, all art (qua commodities) starts to resemble each other. Genuine differences are eliminated through the dream of eventually joining the ruling rackets.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory”, 96. Similarly Horkheimer write about this in the context of Caste Society: “The terrible differentiation in ways of work and life, which enables the Indian life-process to succeed, was rendered intelligible by the idea of the transmigration of souls, according to which birth into an upper or lower caste is the consequence of actions in an earlier life. The lowest classes find in this idea a special reason for not wanting any change in the system. In so far as a Pariah can say that he is faithful to the prescriptions for his caste, he hopes that in his next birth he will rise into the Brahman caste and enjoy its privileges.” (Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 63)</d-footnote> Adorno writes,</p> <blockquote> <p>“the prisoners of the system, strive to bring about this leveling by imitating their stunted rulers in the hope of receiving a pittance in their old age, if only they can prove themselves worthy. The belief that they might be able to form an organized class and conduct a class war crumbles in the minds of the dispossessed along with liberal illusions.”<d-footnote>Adorno, *“*Reflections on Class Theory”, 96.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Unlike the pragmatists, the objective of materialism (according to the early critical theorists) was to demonstrate that corroboration between ideas and reality qua the notion of use is itself a “historical occurrence” that arises in definite social relations. To demystify the concepts of realism that are taken as granted.</p> <p>For instance, the so-called “natural” facts of human society such as a family are reframed as a hierarchical racket with the figure of the father at the top. The family that serves to socialize children into existing conditions through discipline and punishment, the child integrates herself the conditions of domination within the family unit through a memetic response, “submission to the categorical imperative of duty has been from the beginning a conscious goal of the bourgeois family.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family”, 99.</d-footnote> The family qua racket is cemented as the primary conservative force in society that compels a sense of economic and social responsibility for the wife and children dependent on the husband’s reliance on a wage. Rebellion against the family and the patriarchal system is conceptualized as abandonment/disloyalty to one’s own group, domination is sublimated into the very consciousness of a person.<d-footnote>Ibid, 120,</d-footnote> Similarly, official legal titles are certifications that signify belonging to a racket through the state apropos the legal form. Individuals are <em>integrated</em> into the system through the process of certification, “legal and illegal titles […] are distinguished by the fact that the world has an all-embracing organization; none should escape its protection; if proscribed by its agencies, one is forsaken.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist” in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 12, 289.</d-footnote></p> <p>In the outline for a planned book on rackets, Horkheimer writes, “The fact that history is a history of class struggles means that history is a history of rackets fighting among themselves and against the rest of society.”<d-footnote>Typescript “Notizen zum Programm des Buches, 3.8.1942,” Max Horkheimer Nachlass XI.10.1 https://arcinsys.hessen.de/arcinsys/detailAction.action?detailid=v3007298. Adorno similarly writes, “In the image of the latest economic phase, history is the history of monopolies. In the image of the manifest act of usurpation that is practiced nowadays by the leaders of capital and labor acting in consort, it is the history of gang wars and rackets.” Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 100.</d-footnote> The concept of racket applied in history reveals the logic of domination immanent in class society that shackles the individual within groups, that in times of crisis results in a rapid unleashing of irrational destruction and violence. Under the limits imposed by class society, individuals are forced to integrate themselves into groups that will rule over groups below them—The oppressed become the oppressors of “those further down” the hierarchy.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Liberalism based on the idea of social contract between individuals in the <em>state of nature</em>, that will render individuals free from domination failed to fulfill its promise. Traditional forms of domination and rule that were understood as <em>inadequate</em> to liberalism was instead integrated into the economic apparatus, “by abolishing the classes in this way, class rule comes into its own.”<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 100.</d-footnote> For the IfS, only through the establishment of a rationally organized society that with the association of free individuals<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Traditional and Critical Theory” in *Critical theory*, 218.</d-footnote> by a conscious working class struggle will lead to the unfolding of genuine democracy and freedom.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In a letter to Horkheimer, Kirchheimer states that as ideology of existing conditions has deeply steeped into consciousness—it has been accompanied by a distrust of theory, rise in conspiratorial thinking, and explicitly anti-scientific sentiment. Ideology has “withdrawn from psychology into the anthropological fundament,”<d-footnote>See Neumann’s letter to Horkheimer in *Max Horkheimer gesammelte Schriften*, Bd. 17, 482-483.</d-footnote> which calls for a “materialist anthropology” to understand and supplant existing conditions.</p> <p>The IfS had been writing during monopoly capitalism with authoritarian state presence throughout society apropos cold war liberalism, fascism and state socialism. Which starkly resembles neo-liberalism apropos the identity between unfettered market forces and state of today. Sociology of the racket provides us the framework to better understand the mutually interlocking relationship between reactionary organizations, class structure of a society with expansion of the informal economy and the democratic backsliding seen throughout the contemporary world—for instance the relationship between the state, big business, and militant Hindutva groups in India could be understood as composed of mutually interlocking rackets arising with large scale monopolization and decreasing economic stability. It provides a valuable research program to investigate our contemporary world.</p> <p>Horkheimer writes about how initiation rituals of tribes could be understood as integration into rackets, the ritual signifying the socialization of an individual into group norms against the world.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The sociology of the racket also shows the possibility of genuine freedom and democracy that can imagine a racket-free society made up of freely associating producers. The utopian potential of a liberated society, even at the darkest of time, even with total integration of everyone into an irrational society, the future remains open with possibilities through the very conditions of existing society. As Adorno writes,</p> <blockquote> <p>In reified human beings reification finds its outer limits. They catch up with the technical forces of production in which the relations of production lie hidden: in this way these relations lose the shock of their alien nature because the alienation is so complete. But they may soon also lose their power. Only when the victims completely assume the features of the ruling civilization will they be capable of wresting them from the dominant power. The only remaining differentiating factor is reduced to naked usurpation. Only in its blind anonymity could the economy appear as fate: its spell is broken by the horror of the seeing dictatorship. The mimicking of the classless society by class society has been so successful that, while the oppressed have all been co-opted, the futility of all oppression becomes manifest. The ancient myth proves to be quite feeble in its new omnipotence. Even if the dynamic at work was always the same, its end today is not the end.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 110.</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>Racket society produces its own antinomy with the formation of anti-racket political and artistic units with “with [their points] directed upwards”<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Die Rackets und der Geist.”</d-footnote> that aim to abolish racket society through the formation of a political class of the exploited and subordinated.</p>]]></content><author><name>Re Tejus</name></author><category term="Racketology"/><category term="report"/><category term="write-up"/><category term="study"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part 2 on the Frankfurt School's racket concept]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introducing Racket Theory</title><link href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing Racket Theory"/><published>2025-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketIntro/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/post27-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/post27-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/post27-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/post27.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br/></p> <p>The texts collected here belong to the materials on ‘racket theory’ composed by members of the Institute for Social Research between 1941 and 1944.

We have found it helpful to divide our subsequent analysis of the racket theory project into three major sections, which are not exclusive in terms of content. Our narrative starts with the earliest use of the term in Max Horkheimer’s essay “The End of Reason” (1942). After this, we turn to analyzing the stream of texts which were explicitly composed for or about publication(s), mostly written between spring 1942 and fall 1943. Then we treat the topic of reflexivity and the specific character of the racket theory project that flows from its particular form of reflexivity. Finally, we briefly discuss some particularities of the core racket theory texts before concluding. Translations from additional German sources are our own.</p> <h2 id="the-beginnings-of-racket-theorie">The Beginnings of ‘Racket Theorie’</h2> <p>In the development of early Critical Theory as a whole, racket theory is in many respects the successor to the Institute’s 1930s socio-psychological studies on the role of ‘authority,’ defined as the psychological internalization of class domination,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in modern society, which culminated in the 1936 publication of <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em>. The remaining members of the Institute—specifically Horkheimer, Adorno, Löwenthal, and Paul Massing—would return to the more general problematic of ‘authority’ and ‘authoritarianism’ in the late 1940s with the <em>Studies in Prejudice</em> series that Horkheimer edited with Samuel Flowerman for the American Jewish Committee, and especially in <em>The Authoritarian Personality</em> (1950), where Adorno would build off of the same Frommian concept of the authoritarian character structure that grounded the 1936 <em>Studien</em>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p> <p>Horkheimer’s essays “The Jews and Europe” (1939) and “Authoritarian State” (1940) were also important precursors to the racket theory project. These two essays touch on many themes that would reappear a few years later in the racket theory corpus: fundamental commonalities between fascism and liberal capitalism, the decline of law and return of direct domination, the worthlessness of reformism, etc. The essential difference between these essays and the racket theory corpus is the absence of any unifying concept in the former. From 1942, the concept of the racket would quickly come to fill this role in both their short- and long-form reflections on economics and politics. It would serve as the term mediating between their presentation of the constant of impersonal domination in capitalist society as a totality and the variable forms of more personal or direct domination through which the former increasingly found expression in the everyday lives of the subjects of late capitalism.</p> <p>The story of the racket concept in particular begins with the final issue of the Institute for Social Research’s official journal, <em>Studies in Philosophy and Social Science</em>—the short-lived (1939-1942) English-language successor to their <em>Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung</em> (1932-1939)—in Summer 1941, which has retrospectively become known as the “State Capitalism” issue (Nos. 2 and 3 of Vol. IX), named after the central idea of Friedrich Pollock’s two controversial contributions: “State Capitalism: Its Possibilities and Limitations” and “Is National Socialism a New Order?” Though Horkheimer and Adorno’s work from this period has traditionally been interpreted as an extension of Pollock’s state capitalism thesis, such readings almost entirely ignore the substantial critiques both Horkheimer and Adorno level against Pollock’s theory—largely in agreement with the better-known critiques of Neumann and Kirchheimer—in the ensuing debate over whether the Institute should publish the text at all.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> This confrontation with Pollock’s theory was a crucial ingredient in the development of the racket theory project.</p> <p>The final issue of <em>Studies</em> opens with Horkheimer’s essay “The End of Reason,” which was written in close collaboration with Adorno. In the Horkheimer Archive, amidst the drafts for “End of Reason,” there are a number of excerpts, with unique handwritten corrections and notes for revision, from one section of the essay in particular under the title “Racket Theorie.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> This passage seems to have acquired a newfound, retrospective significance for Horkheimer and Adorno as they worked on the earliest drafts of the <em>Fragmente</em> in Spring and Summer 1942. The excerpt provides a provisional definition of the racket as a form of social domination—“[p]rotection is the archetype of domination”—after its violent historical reappearance in the transition from the “interlude” free market liberalism to monopoly capitalism: “Monopolism has […] led social domination back to its true nature which had continued to operate only where the humane form of domination had left some loopholes to inhumanity.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> The passage concludes with the earliest formulation of a research program devoted to the racket itself: “A study of such border phenomena as racketeering may offer useful parallels for understanding certain developmental tendencies in modern society.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> The apparent marginality of racketeering relative to the monopolistic planning of states is exactly what made the racket so promising as a model for the explanation of monopoly.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p> <h2 id="thwarted-plans-for-publication">Thwarted Plans for Publication</h2> <p>Prompted by internal debates opened during the composition and publication of the “State Capitalism” issue, Horkheimer prepared a memo (the “LA Memo”) in April 1942 about the ‘non-philosophical’ problems—many of them related to so-called state capitalism—that would have to be tackled in his planned book on dialectics, which would eventually become <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>. The word ‘racket’ only appears once in memo, indicating that it was not yet the focal concept for the planned work. A slightly earlier letter to Felix Weil from March of ‘42 related Horkheimer’s desire to recruit Weil as well as Friedrich Pollock (and perhaps Henryk Grossmann and Arkady Gurland) to assist with writing the sociological-economic part of the dialectics book.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p> <p>By the Summer of ‘42, Horkheimer and Adorno had begun work on what would become <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, and they were increasingly aware that an extended treatment of their new thinking about class, authority, and the economy would not fit in the ‘dialectics book.’ This was largely due to the fact that the theory of the racket was conceived from the beginning as a multidisciplinary project, something Horkheimer and Adorno could not accomplish without collaborators in political science, law, and economics. In August of ‘42, they—probably Adorno working on the basis of prior discussions with Horkheimer—produced another memo (“Notes for the Programme of the Book”) outlining their plans for an independent book on what they were now calling “racket theory”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> or “sociology of rackets.”<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Inspired by this second memo, Adorno quickly drafted the essay “Reflections on Class Theory,” a text which he told Horkheimer could be “readily broken up and transferred to different places in the end product [i.e. the planned book] as needed.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p> <p>The rudimentary plan of these memos gestated into more concrete plans for a 1943 yearbook—presumably a continuation of or successor to <em>Studies in Philosophy and Social Science</em>—that would include contributions from the likes of Arkady Gurland, Herbert Marcuse, Franz Neumann, and Otto Kirchheimer. Kirchheimer’s contribution would be about “rackets in the labor movement” and “analyze the differences between industrial monopolies and the trade unions,” while Neumann would write “a study on the possibilities of political forms which do not have the character of rackets” and Gurland’s essay would deal with “certain statistical data with regard to the changes in the working classes.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Marcuse’s contribution was presumably to be the essay he was working on at the time, a study of “how new forms of control, manipulation, and behavior express themselves in the language of this age” entitled “Operational Thinking and Social Domination.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Horkheimer confided in Marcuse that he “[had] the feeling that the realization of this plan would be the first step toward giving [sic] a piece of Critical Theory which would not be purely philosophical.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>There were, however, some significant problems with this plan. As Thomas Wheatland has shown in <em>The</em> <em>Frankfurt School In Exile</em>, the Institute for Social Research’s affiliation with Columbia University, which facilitated the former’s emigration to the United States in 1934, was contingent on both the Institute’s financial autonomy and the continuation of their pre-existing social research using quantitative and empirical methods.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> With the Horkheimer circle’s bitter break with Erich Fromm, the leading empirical social researcher of the group, in 1939 and the Institute’s rapidly worsening financial situation, they had become incapable of fulfilling either of Columbia’s desiderata by the outbreak of WWII.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> In addition to recurrent suspicions towards the Institute core’s Marxist, or even communist, sympathies<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and an undisclosed quota system that limited the number of Jewish faculty members,<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> a more permanent affiliation between the Institute and Columbia’s sociology department was endangered by the latter’s internal disputes over its own direction and leadership between 1939 and 1942. After the Institute failed to secure a source of external funding for any of the ambitious group research projects it proposed in this period, Horkheimer, who had since moved to Los Angeles in Spring 1941, finally responded to Columbia’s reluctance to support the Institute beyond offering a teaching appointment to Franz Neumann in 1942 by making the decision to radically downsize the Institute in late 1942.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> The lack of any institutional affiliation meant that funding for the yearbook would be hard to come by.</p> <p>At the same time, several of the contributing authors—Marcuse, Neumann, and Kirchheimer—had recently obtained gainful employment at the Research &amp; Analysis branch of the United States Office of Strategic Services and would have little time to complete their projected contributions.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> On top of these two problems, one of the major planned contributors, Henryk Grossmann, found himself increasingly at odds with the inner circle of the Institute both theoretically and interpersonally.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Plans were quickly scaled back from a full-fledged yearbook to a smaller mimeographed edition,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> but even this apparently proved unfeasible. Otto Kirchheimer actually completed his essay and wound up getting “In Quest of Sovereignty” published in <em>The Journal of Politics</em> in May 1944 after it became clear that the Institute’s publication plans had come to naught. Marcuse would eventually repurpose some of his work from “Operational Thinking…” for <em>One Dimensional Man</em>.</p> <p>That’s as far as plans for publication in book form got, but Horkheimer also produced a series of fragments related to the racket idea and a substantial essay on the topic. While we know that Horkheimer started work on his fragments in 1942, the exact date is not entirely clear. The most likely possibility is that at least some of them were started in Spring or Summer 1942 and thus provided a rough conceptual basis for the subsequent racket theory texts. It is also unclear what exactly Horkheimer planned to do with these fragments: whether they were intended for publication or merely a means for internal theoretical edification or etc.</p> <p>In early 1943, Horkheimer began writing a more cohesive essay on racket theory, hoping against hope that he still might be able to produce the planned yearbook or at least find some outlet for the racket idea. The text received the deceptively unimaginative title “On the Sociology of Class Relations” and would only be published in full posthumously. Horkheimer sent out copies of an early draft to various Institute associates—Marcuse, Kirchheimer, and Neumann—for feedback in September 1943 and produced a finished draft on the basis of their feedback shortly afterwards. “Sociology of Class Relations” stands out as the most integrated and wide-ranging text in the entire racket theory corpus.</p> <p>Horkheimer continued to periodically revise the fragments with input from Adorno until Spring 1944, when they were all, with the sole exception of “On the Ideology of Politics Today,” compiled together in a staple-bound typed booklet (complete with a table of contents, pagination, and a prefatory note) under the title “Concepts as a Supplement to the Festschrift for Friedrich Pollock.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> As that title suggests, this compilation was a companion volume to the original <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em> version of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, which Horkheimer and Adorno had dedicated to their friend and collaborator Pollock on the occasion of his 50th birthday. The preface to the <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em> would also be the first and last time that “On the Sociology of Class Relations” was mentioned in print. Adorno and Horkheimer explained that the essay was excluded along with “all English works produced in the same period, regardless of their connection to the fragments,” but nevertheless belonged to the “whole work” which they “[hoped] to complete… in the not too distant future.”<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p> <p>After the limited ‘publication’ (so to speak) of the “Concepts” and the <em>Philosophische Fragmente</em>, Horkheimer and Adorno shelved the racket theory texts for a few years. They eventually returned to them in 1946-1947 while preparing the new edition of what was now titled <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> for publisher Querido and, slightly later, Horkheimer’s book <em>Eclipse of Reason</em>. Among the extensive changes they made to the text of <em>Dialectic</em> for the Querido edition, the fragment “Strafgefangene” (or “Prisoners”) from the “Concepts” was incorporated into the fragment “From ‘A Theory of the Criminal,’” itself a lengthy excerpt from the full “Theory of the Criminal” of the “Concepts.” Beyond this, none of the older, unpublished work was included.</p> <p>“On the Sociology of Class Relations” fared slightly better. In 1946, substantial sections of it were revised and repurposed for Chapter IV of Horkheimer’s <em>Eclipse of Reason</em>, “Rise and Decline of the Individual.”<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> Among the most radical of these revisions was the elimination of the concept of the “racket” from the text entirely.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> The publication of <em>Eclipse</em> marked the end of the Horkheimer and Adorno’s attempts to publish their writings on the racket from the early 1940s,<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> though not the end of their preoccupation with the problem of the disappearance of socialist internationalism with the ‘racketization’ of the labor movement.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p> <h2 id="the-reflexivity-of-racket-theory">The Reflexivity of Racket Theory</h2> <p>Much of the authoritative secondary literature on racket theory to date has approached these early sketches searching for some basic incoherence that is meant to explain why the project would ultimately remain unfinished.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> However, the points of incoherence often imputed to racket theory under the assumption of its necessary failure prove to be the same problems the critical theorists consciously adopted as their point of departure for the reflexive contextualization and construction of racket theory from the beginning.</p> <p>From its inception in “The End of Reason,” the concept of the racket has a paradoxical historical status: in the transition of modern capitalist society from “liberalism” to “monopolism,” the ‘archetype’ and ‘true nature’ of social domination that remains the condition of class society, i.e., ‘prehistory’ as a whole, is revealed.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> In each of their subsequent contributions to racket theory, Horkheimer and Adorno will contextualize their theoretical efforts both within the process of ‘racketization’ society undergoes in the transition from ‘liberal’ to ‘monopoly’ capitalism and in the ‘negative invariance’<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> of human prehistory as a whole. Closing his first thesis of his essay devoted to rackets, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942), Adorno formulates the historical discovery of prehistory in the language of the <em>Manifesto</em>: “All history is the history of class struggles because it was always the same thing, namely, prehistory.”<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> The last line of Horkheimer’s “On the Sociology of Class Relations” (1943) is a direct interpolation from Marx’s remarks on the method of political economy from the ‘Introduction’ to the <em>Grundrisse</em>: “the anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the ape.”<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> In a letter to Felix Weil from January 1943, Horkheimer explains: “The meaning of that truth is that once we know man, we can discover his beginnings in earlier forms of life. Once Fascism had developed in European society, we now are able to find its hallmarks in earlier stages of human history, but it would be an error to say that, because of those traces, the development was a necessary one.”<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> Throughout the fragments, the racket will appear under the dual aspect of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic,’ historical variable and prehistorical constant, according to this parallax. This accounts for the centrality of the problem of law in the sketches on racket theory, and more specifically on what Evgeny Pashukanis called “indissoluble internal connection between the categories of the economy based on the commodity and on money, and the legal form itself.”<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> For the subject of modern social domination is in the end neither the state as collective capitalist nor the conspiracy of the rackets, but “the unconscious colossus of real existence, subjectless capitalism, [which] inflicts its destruction blindly.”<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p> <p>In a pair of letters written in February 1943, Horkheimer is clear: the theoretical perspective required for racket theory is none other than the Marxian critique of political economy, which alone makes it possible for the social theorist to “to deprive liberalism of the weapon to think of itself as of the ‘natural’ economic system and to show up the identity of the meta-economic structure of both the present day collective and the old free market system.”<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> The twist, however, is that the Marxian theory of social totality becomes illegible in the fragmentation of the social sciences into a system of rackets this theory is needed to critique: “This is what the critique of political economy, which established dialectical relations between the totality of the social sciences, has become among these academic groups, a kind of dealing between the different rackets which confirm one another that they are indispensable.”<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> The same ‘racketization’ of society in the transition from free-market, ‘liberal’ capitalism to monopoly capitalism that underlies and drives the development of racket theory simultaneously undermines and frustrates the intelligibility of the theory itself. For Horkheimer and Adorno, the false modesty of epistemological pluralism which posits the <em>a priori</em> insurmountability of the division of labor in the sciences is as vicious as the pre-established harmony of the sciences was in the dogmatic philosophical systems of the past. The dispute unfolding within the social sciences between special-scientific pluralism and the renaissance of metaphysical holism is interpreted as a refractory expression of a generalized social crisis characterized by the simultaneous fragmentation and consolidation of political rackets. The lack of conscious coordination between the sciences is the reverse side of an unconscious agreement each has with the existing order of society. This reality became increasingly pressing for the racket theorists in the 1940s as they found themselves increasingly forced to seek funding from various government and non-profit ‘rackets’ whose patronage was conditional on the silence of critical theory towards the total mobilization of American society during WWII. The content of racket theory rebounds on its form.</p> <p>In a letter written in August, 1942, on the style of his collaborations with Adorno, Horkheimer writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>I’m far from imagining that our thought could “break through in America” … . We no longer hope for more than that, should the day finally break, what we’ve written will be but a small star, flickering, though barely visible, in the horrific night of the present. For what else should the gaze which stares into the fireworks of magazines and the other slick products of scientific and unscientific mass culture see when it turns away from it all if not darkness? … Any theses of ours, as the guiding principles of a successful publication, would at best only add a new shading of color to the bouquet of rockets.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The degree to which their stylistic experimentation during the composition of <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em> was influenced by their conception of the racket as a form of social domination has yet to be fully explored.</p> <h2 id="additional-remarks-on-the-texts-and-their-content">Additional Remarks on the Texts and their Content</h2> <p>As mentioned above, all of the fragments that we are translating and publishing here were all included in a booklet except for “On the Ideology of Politics Today.” Before discussing the content of the fragments from the “Concepts” compilation, some attention must be given to this particular fragment. While this fragment is incomplete—it breaks off mid-sentence—it still contains a particularly pointed criticism of Friedrich Pollock’s theory of state capitalism, one which has prompted previous interpreters to attempt—unsuccessfully, in our view—to direct the criticism away from Pollock himself.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p> <p>The five fragments from the “Concepts” that we selected for translation and publication are all closely related on a thematic level. In particular, they dedicate significant space to analyzing the conflicted relation between rackets and law—both concepts serving as synecdoches for specific forms of domination. The particularism of the racket is also its “fundamental illegality;”<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> it is the antithesis of the abstract, universal domination of law. Despite the apparent conflict between rackets and law, they are inseparably bound together in reality. The state’s justice is founded by and can only be administered by rackets; law in class society is “set in pre-established harmony with the rule of cliques which hold weapons and means of production.”<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> Its apparent universality is set up for the advantage of a particular class. The law has an elective affinity with money, commodities, and private property. In spite of the universal validity of both forms, the sanctions of law gravitate towards the poor in particular just as commoditized wealth goes to the rich. Thus rackets and law are in a chiasmic relation of speculative identity and non-identity: rackets found the law; law is foundered on rackets.</p> <p>The figure of the criminal holds a special place in this tortuous interplay of universal and particular. The criminal is punished for transgressing the universally binding restrictions that enable collective survival in the state—the so-called common good—in the interests of their own benefit. But, as Horkheimer argues, “[t]he enemy is never the object of punishment, for it is always administered to the defenseless.”<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> Thus, punishment does not follow the logic of self-defense taught by Hobbes: it is an impassioned act of revenge against someone already disarmed that reveals the “illegality of the law.”<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> Law constitutes itself as human society’s defense against nature, but behind this rationalistic alibi is the same cruelly natural fate it was supposed to prevent: painful death without reason.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup></p> <p>Another form of false universality and unity assumed by the racket is the fascist ‘collective’ or ‘community.’ Whatever internal unity such a formation possesses must be placed in the context of its violent competition with other ‘collectives’ and suppression of the outcasts unlucky enough to be excluded from the benefits of any racket. Of course, this aforementioned unity is also largely transient, if not entirely illusory. Such ‘collectives’ are invariably characterized by violently enforced internal hierarchies and struggle within each level of their hierarchy. The racketized form of collectivity is present also in the working class in the shape of the reformist unions and parties that narrowly seek after privileges for their members. This is not an inevitable result, but rather a betrayal—one that leads to the destruction of its all-too-clever perpetrator.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>Turning our attention to the two memos, we must recognize that these are somewhat special documents, as they were not intended for external promulgation. We have chosen to translate and publish them because they provide unique insight into the Frankfurt School’s racket theory project and their internal working process more generally.</p> <p>The “LA Memo” (“On parts of the Los Angeles work program that cannot be carried out by the philosophers”) is difficult to date exactly, but it is definitely from some point in April 1942. The document is of special interest because of its strikingly clear formulation of the sociological and economic problems motivating the Institute’s research at the time. The language used in the memo indicates that it dates to the period when Horkheimer and Adorno still believed that a treatment of racket theory could fit into the ‘dialectics book.’ The “Notes for the Programme of the Book,” dated August 20th, 1942, were accompanied by thirty sheets of “excerpts from texts on the history of rackets” (seemingly compiled by Adorno) from September 15th, 1942.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> These excerpts were mostly from works from or about Ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy that dealt with topics relevant to the themes of the racket theory project (political power, state violence, etc).</p> <p>Both of these internal documents show the Institute’s continued interest in synthetic interdisciplinary social research that would incorporate history, philosophy, economics, sociology, and psychoanalysis. It also indirectly shows the difficulties of such a project. The ambitious outline found in “Notes for the Programme of the Book” recalls the similarly ambitious 1934 plans for <em>Studien über Autorität und Familie</em>, plans which the Institute was still incapable of fulfilling then despite having more financial resources at their disposal as well as actual stable working relationships between all the major contributors.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p> <p><br/></p> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/RacketTexts/">Read the Fragments and Texts on Racket Theory</a></p> <p><a href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/ClassRelations/">Read “On the Sociology of Class Relations”</a></p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <p><br/></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>See <a href="https://jamescrane.substack.com/i/161511932/translators-note-reconstructing-the-formation-of-the-encore">James Crane, “Translator’s note: Reconstructing the Formation of the <em>Encore</em>.” in <em>Substudies</em> (blog), 4/18/2025</a> <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>MHA Na 1 <a href="https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/horkheimer/content/titleinfo/5668657">639</a>, [39]-[218]. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Max Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family” [1936] in <em>Critical Theory: Selected Essays</em> (Continuum, 2002), 68-69. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>For more on Erich Fromm’s importance for the Freudo-Marxist ‘analytic social psychology’ of the early Frankfurt School, see J.

Legal ownership was the ideological expression of the fact that a minority of people occupied a position which enabled them to exclude the rest of society from freely using the land or other instruments necessary for the continuation of social life on a given scale. The ruling class has absorbed the gifts of culture, that is to say, the difference between the total product of consumer goods and the bare necessities of life of those who produced them, and, though guided itself by controlled social forces, has determined the kind of goods to be made and the methods to be used.</p> <p>The privileges thus held by the ruling minorities throughout the ages were not altogether irrational. It is true that, in the last analysis, they were conquered and maintained by force; but the fact that the groups which enjoyed them were able to make use of that force for the organization and stabilization of some robust form of society was a sign of their being economically more advanced. Their rules promoted and conserved a mode of production which, at its hey-day was not inadequate to the developmental status of the productive forces. In this respect, the rulers represented a higher rationality than the rest of the population. In the later periods of their reigns, when the principles of organization, which they represented, were made obsolete by the progress of other parts of the population, their power became more convulsive and terroristic but, at the same time, became weaker and hence more irrational, finally approaching blind despotism. They were transformed into purely repressive factors. The social and cultural forms for which they stood, wearily maintained by their administrative apparatus against new possibilities of human association, exercised a mutilating effect upon the minds and faculties of mankind.</p> <p>The notion of class as it underlies the materialistic theory of history needs further elucidation. It does not refer to a consistent and homogenous unity. At least during the most typical periods, property of the means of production was not identical with their well-planned social use, nor with the existence of a unified will and determination. The various ruling groups understood each other fairly well whenever it was necessary to crush the resistance of the exploited masses or of any forces threatening to set up a new social rule. Thus, when it came to punitive measures against the progressive burghers of Southern France or even against the proletarian elements in Flanders, the worldly and spiritual powers of the Middle Ages, emperors, kings, and popes, forgot their traditional conflicts for the time being and united for the defense of the prevailing hierarchical system of society. However, medieval history offers no picture of solidarity among the rulers of the Christian world. On the contrary, there was a never ending fight over booty going on among the different hierarchical groups. Each wanted to assume authority over large areas in order to be nourished and housed and served by as large a population as possible. The same holds good for the ruling groups of Greek antiquity, as represented by the city-states and factions. The ruling class, held together by the common interest in its specific mode of exploitation has always been characterized by its internal struggles, by the efforts of one of its parts to secure the spoils that others might appropriate. The struggle for security among the elite has been a race for the most far-reaching command possible, in other words, for control of production.</p> <p>For several reasons this nature of class was obscured during the 19th century. The emancipation of the bourgeoisie from the restrictions of mercantilism and the release of the laborer from serfdom seemed to have abolished the insurmountable differences among the various sectors of humanity. Economic competition embracing all parts of the population was more peaceful although more thorough and universal than the quarrels and discords of the great in times past. [It was one of the achievements of Marx’s writings that he,]<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> while stressing the progressive features of capitalism, unveiled its oppressive character and showed the old issue of power behind the apparently rational set-up of the market system. Today the similarity of the different historical phases of the bourgeois economy with regard to the principle of exploitation tends to become manifest. Even academic economists are shifting from the optimistic concept of an economy gravitating towards sheer harmony to a pessimistic power theory. Formerly they blamed Marx for the introduction of the “non-economic” concept of exploitation. Now they go much too far in the vindication of non-economic factors. They tend to replace economy by a more than simple political or psychological explanation of present-day events.</p> <p>In fact, the idea of competition as it was conceived in liberalistic theory was misleading in many respects, two of them being particularly important for the theory of class relations. First, the nature of competition among workers was essentially different from the nature of competition among capitalists. Competition among workers, at least during the heyday of liberalism, simply meant that there were so many workers that wages could hardly rise above the cost of bare living, and in many cases even dropped below it. This comes to the fore in the nature of the labor contract. Fascism has only revealed what was already inherent in liberalism: the delusive nature of the labor contract as a deal between partners equally free. It would be a grave theoretical mistake to denounce the contract in modern totalitarianism as a mere formality, and stress its genuine authenticity under liberalism. In both phases of the economic system, the aim of the contract may well be considered as the maintenance of that same basic inequality which is shrouded in its democratic language.</p> <p>Second, the monopolization of certain key positions within capitalist competition is much older than the monopolistic economy. Competition among the entrepreneurs themselves was never quite as free as it seemed. Here we are not thinking of state interference with industry, which economists are wont to [reproach]<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> as long as big business does not take the state under its own management. We have in mind rather the inequality resulting from the different degrees of social power exercised by various industries. Such differences depend largely upon the stage of economic concentration and centralization of the respective industries, upon its importance for the regular functioning of the economic life of the nation, and upon its affiliation with the military and administrative power apparatus. Therefore, the groups which by birth or deceit, brutality or shrewdness, expertness in engineering machinery or human relations, by marriage or adulation, have come into control of a part of the total capital invested in industry, form a hierarchy of economic power which has limited the free play of competition at each of its stages. The discovery that the national economy of various capitalistic countries depended upon 200, 60, or even a smaller number of families, brought this situation into a clear light which eventually made the veil of free competition transparent.</p> <p>The development of capitalistic society according to its own inherent tendencies caused the progressive traits of competition to disappear. It severed the link between the needs of consumers and the profit-interest of the individual entrepreneur; it diminished the possibility, slight as it was, of an independent mind gaining access to an independent position; it reduced the number of relatively autonomous economic subjects, who by the very fact of that plurality had an interest in the functioning of general law and in its impartial administration. All this vanishes in the later stages of capitalism and allows society to revert to more direct forms of domination, which in fact never had been quite suspended. Yet this process is not only a reactionary one. While the inequalities among the entrepreneurs are shifting into monopolistic and eventually totalitarian control of national life, the relation between Capital and Labor undergoes a most characteristic change. During the latest phase of capitalism, the working class has entered competition by adapting itself to the monopolistic structure of society. It has assumed a form which fits into the monopolistic set-up. Consequently its relationships to the different capitalistic groups are no longer radically different from those prevailing among the capitalistic groups themselves.</p> <p>The new situation is expressed in the concept of Labor (with a capital <em>L</em>) as it is recognized as a guiding intellectual principle not only in the minds of workers but also with the general public. Like Agriculture or Industry, or even sections of Industry, such as Steel, Rubber, and Oil, Labor is a collective term which is not an ordinary <em>abstractum</em> or <em>generale</em>. With regard to the individual elements included in their logical structure, such entities resemble a unit like State, Nation, Church, rather than a generality like Color, or Animal. They emphasize the concreteness of themselves as universal concepts, and disregard the elements of which they are comprised. Their logical structure mirrors exactly their objects. It stresses the collective individualities at the expense of the single individuals absorbed by them. The logical elements of the collective concept of Labor, i.e. the mass of ordinary members, are not the forces which, by their own ideas and spontaneity, determine the course of the whole. To use mathematical terminology, they are not so much the constant value with regard to the whole as the fluctuating one. On the contrary, the whole, i.e., the organization, determines and even overawes the individual, for the leaders, with their specific materialistic and power interests, with their philosophy and character structure, have an infinitely greater weight than any plain member.</p> <p>There is a decisive difference between the social units of our monopolistic society and those of earlier periods.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> All these older units are totalities in the sense that they are thoroughly organized, integrated, and ruled by a hierarchy. In contrast to modern totalities, however, the life of the totemistic tribe, the clan, the church of the Middle Ages, the nation in the era of the bourgeois revolutions, took their course according to mythological patterns which had assumed their shape in long historical developments. The patterns had become fixed images and models for the totalities, as did the Gospel for the church. True, such patterns, magical, religious, or philosophical, were intellectual authorities of the then present forms of domination. They reflected, as it were, the hierarchical stratification of society. But while they formed a cultural binding-substance which maintained a social formation even when its role in production had become obsolete, they also preserved the idea of human solidarity. This they did by the very fact that they objectified spiritual structures. Any system of ideas as far as it’s written in meaningful language, whether religious, artistic, or logical, has a general connotation and pretends to be true in a universal sense.</p> <p>To be sure, the objectivity and universality of the older collective units formed an ideology which constituted an essential condition of their parasitic existence in the body of society. But the patterns of organizations such as the medieval church did not directly coincide with the forms of material life. Organization in the strictest sense applied mainly to the hierarchy itself and to the ritual functions of both clergy and laity. Apart from that, neither life itself nor the intellectual framework by which it was reflected was completely integrated. The basic spiritual categories were not entirely fused with pragmatic considerations. Thus they maintained a certain element of independence and autonomy. They were not ready-made factory products, no plastic molds simply superimposed by the organization. The participation of the layman in the activities of such bodies remained separate from his daily work and life. There was still a cleavage between culture and production. This cleavage left more loopholes than the modern type of super-organization which virtually reduces the individual to a mere center of reaction. Modern universals, such as Labor, are integral parts of a unified social and economic system controlled by monopolies. By the very means of such universals, monopolies absorb the individual entirely and transform him into an element of the mechanism of production in which the so-called culture is only a cog. In short, the older forms of totalities which professed to comply with an aloof spiritual model, contained an element which is lacking in the purely pragmatistic totalities of monopolism. The latter also show a hierarchical structure – and are strictly integrated and despotic totalities but the ascent of their functionaries to the upper grade has nothing to do with any quality of theirs with regard to an objective spiritual content but almost exclusively with their ability to impose on people, to handle people, to be clever with people. Purely administrative and technical qualities define the human forces governing modern totalities. Such traits were by no means lacking in leaders of the different sectors of ancient classes, but by their radical separation from any autonomous idea. These traits give the modern totality its particular character.</p> <p>The concept of labor as a pragmatic totality becomes quite clear when compared with the proletariat as conceived by Marx. For him, the workers were the masses of all exploited people in industrialist society. In spite of all the minor differences of their individual fates, each of them, on the whole, had the same outlook on life: periods of employment would become shorter, the pressure of the “reserve army” on wages grow stronger, and misery, in the midst of an ever wealthier society, become unbearable. Marxian theory predicted that the capitalists would become less and less able to grant even a bare existence to the majority of the population. This trend would be expressed in the life of the average worker by a decay of his whole situation, by a deepening of his poverty, by growing hopelessness and despair. The economic pressure resulting from this state of affairs, together with the enlightenment of the workers achieved by their role in the modern productive process, would lead the formation of a party which would finally change the world. This party would spring from the similarity of the conditions of the workers all over the world. Its principles and structure would not be so much concerned with the temporary differences in their financial situation in various branches of production or various geographical and national settings. It would not express so much the actual conscience of the individual worker as affected by all the mutilating influences of exploitation. Essentially, it would embody the resistance against the frustrations imposed upon man by social forms which had become purely oppressive. It would not be based upon psychological factors but upon the objective tendency of the economic system. The efforts of this party would be inspired by the fulfillment of just those human aspirations, material and spiritual, which were suppressed and distorted by the modern industrial process which has made the individual a kind of accessory to machinery. The party’s aims were to be connected with the plight of the individual and the masses, and had no special affinity to any particular category of workers at the expense of others. It represented the oppressed masses as a whole. Since the reason for the laborer’s frustrations was not considered to be found in any specific defect of capitalism but in the very principle of class-rule, the efforts of the workers’ party were to be guided at each stage by the objective idea of abolishing that rule and the establishing of true community.</p> <p>This plan, however, was burdened from the very beginning of labor movements with an intrinsic difficulty. While the workers had to bear the full pressure of this society, whose tendency was to keep them below the minimum standard of living, they had to struggle daily in order to keep themselves alive. This meant that they kept alive a society whose rulers became stronger and stronger through the appropriated labor of the proletariat. Thus, the concept of class struggle always had these two connotations: the abolition of the wage system as such, and the attainment of higher wages within that system. It was the latter down-to-earth activity which once was conceived as the necessary stepping stone to revolution, as, for instance, through the general strike. The obsolescence of the latter idea is only one symptom of the fundamental change that has occurred. The class struggle has been transformed into a system of trade between monopolistic units, into a means of class adaptation, and into wars. Formerly, the relationship between daily struggle and revolutionary aim determined the whole labor movement, at least in continental Europe. Critical theory decided which way was to be taken in each situation. However, the struggling class was never “integrated” into one more competitor in the hunt for surplus value. The party was decidedly not concerned with the increase of its members’ incomes, nor the income or career or social position of its leaders. Working for and even adhering to that party meant the renunciation of all such things. Party members were an avant-garde of the working class for the very reason that such principles could be understood and assimilated only by relatively advanced elements of the working class. They were supposed to control the leaders very closely, and the criterion of that control was supposed to be not the avant-garde’s own wishes and needs, but the common interest of the working class in all countries, as the avant-garde was able to understand it. The tremendous majority of the proletariat was composed of individuals who, in their own psychology, expressed the mutilating effect of exploitation rather than the idea of a free humanity. The party, in spite of, even because of its antagonism to the majority of the masses represented, thought of itself as the genuine conscience of that same majority. Because the masses were unable to concretize their true interests, the party, in its decisions, had to rely on the theory of capitalistic society.</p> <p>Social theory was the heir to the older systems of thought which were supposed to have set the rules for past totalities. These older systems had vanished because the prevailing forms of solidarity proclaimed by them had proven to be treacherous. Unlike the medieval doctrine of the church or the liberalistic apology of the market system, proletarian theory of capitalism did not glorify its subject. It looked upon capitalism as the final form of domination. In no way did it justify the established ideas and superstitions of those whom it guided. In contrast to the tendencies of today’s mass culture, it did not sell the people their own way of living, which they unconsciously abhorred, but overtly acclaimed. Proletarian theory was the critical analysis of reality including the worker’s own warped thoughts. The locus of theory was the difference between the objective interest of the exploited class and the immediate interest of the individual workers: The more this difference is obscured by the existing social set-up, the more theory tends to vanish. Even when the actual masses were hostile to the party, they felt its theory linked them with their own ultimate interests. The party was not above the masses as the labor-leaders of today are above the laborers whom they integrate into their organizational patterns. The proletariat itself remained somewhat amorphous and chaotic, composed of individual subjects. Although deprived as they were of their human qualities by being transformed into mere elements of production, they had not yet become statistical figures of organizations. The character of the individual was not quite replaced by that of the member, defined exclusively by its standardized interests. Around the middle of the 19th century, the non-integrated nature of the individual worker as a part of an amorphous proletariat of the disinherited peasant or artisan, and his retrogressiveness in terms of the ever increasing rational “socialization” (<em>Vergesellschaftung</em>) of society was inseparably bound up with his “progressiveness” in the sense of revolution. [It is significant that, even today, worker’s organizations which are with some justification labeled as “backward” both theoretically and economically have proven to be the most spontaneous elements in critical situations, such as the Spanish Civil War.]<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p> <p>However, the clock cannot be put back nor can the organizational development be revoked or even theoretically rejected. The hope of the proletariat today does not consist of sticking to traditional party and civil war patterns. Rather, it must recognize and fight the monopolistic set-up of society infiltrating into the proletariat’s own organizations and infesting the minds of its individuals. In the 19th century concept of a future rational society the traits which expressed the planning, organizing, and centralizing functions in opposition to “chaotic” liberalistic economy prevailed over the traits expressing the plight of the individual. The workers’ parliamentary parties, which themselves were a product of liberalism and denounced liberalistic irrationality and promoted socialist economy in opposition to an anarchic capitalism. Under monopolism the other side of rationality has become manifest by its increasing suppression: the participation of all in the shaping of social life, equal chance to develop one’s own potentialities, equal security for all. Together with the rationalization of production, the idea of democracy calls for laying aside all fenced off economic positions, for establishing a world free from monopolies. The amorphism, by which the proletariat in the era of Marx and Engels differed fundamentally from any kind of totality, was the reason why, despite its being split into national groups, skilled and unskilled labor, employed and unemployed, its interests could become crystallized in a body such as the party. The trade union, though its role was not to be underestimated, had to subordinate its actions to the party’s strategy. The amorphism of the masses and its complement, theoretical thinking, both expressed in the party’s fight against exploitation as such, formed the contrast to the pragmatic totalities of today. The rise of workers from a passive role in the capitalistic process has been paid for with their complete integration.</p> <p>Labor in monopolistic society is itself a kind of monopoly: to be more exact, it is the monopoly of its leaders. [There are some decisive differences between Labor and capitalistic monopolies. The most important arises from the fact that each capitalistic monopoly constitutes some kind of economic unity which tries to appropriate as much surplus value as possible. The term Labor, however, comprises both the leaders who appropriate the profits and the members who create them. The same process which, both in reality and ideology, has made Labor an economic subject, has transformed the laborer, who was already the object of the entrepreneur, into the object of his organization as well. At the same time that ideology has become more realistic, more down-to-earth, its inherent contradiction to reality, its absurdity, has increased. While the masses think of themselves as the creators of their own destiny, the leaders use them as a commodity. The fact that Labor is a monopoly does not mean that its members, labor aristocracy excepted, are monopolists. It does mean that]<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> the leaders control labor supplies as the presidents of the big corporations control raw materials, machines, or other elements of production. Labor leaders trade on this kind of merchandise, manipulate it, advertise it, and try to fix its price as high as possible. Labor, becoming a trade among others, completes the process of the reification of the human mind. A man’s productive power today is not only bought by the factory and subordinated to the requirements of technology but rationed and managed by superior agencies of the Labor Movement. It is a double-barrelled transformation into things. With religious and moral ideologies fading and proletarian theory being abolished by the march of economic and political events,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> the conscience of the workers tends to become identical with the categories of their leaders’ trade. The idea of intrinsic antagonism between the international proletariat and any system of domination is completely superseded by the concepts connected with the disputes of power between the various monopolies. True, the proletarians of older days did not have any conceptual knowledge of the social mechanisms unveiled by theory, and their minds and souls bore the hallmarks of oppression. Yet, their misery was still the misery of single human beings and therefore connected them with any exploited mass in any country and in any sector of society. Their undeveloped minds were not kept in movement by the techniques of modern mass culture hammering the behavior patterns prevalent under monopolism into their eyes and ears and muscles during leisure time as well as during working hours (from which the so-called amusement period can hardly be differentiated anyway). Workers today as well as the public in general are intellectually better trained, better informed, and much less naive. They know the details of national affairs, and the tricks and crooked means typical of political movements, particularly of those which live from propaganda against corruption. The workers, at least those who have not gone through the hell of Fascism, will join in any persecution of a capitalist or politician who has been singled out because he violated the rules; but they do not question the rules themselves. They have learned to take the basic injustice of class society as a powerful fact and to take powerful facts as the only thing to be respected. Their minds are closed to dreams of a basically different world and to concepts which instead of being mere classifications of facts are formed under the aspect of real fulfillment of those dreams. Their childish belief in such things has been so drastically wiped out of their memory that now they stubbornly believe in reality as it is. Desperately, they repeat the commands which are knocked into the children’s systems when they try to open their eyes: there is only one way to live and that is the actual one, the one of hardboiled smartness; the things that seemed to be opposed to it are idle slogans, lies, metaphysics; he who is unable to adapt himself to this state of affairs, whether oneself or any other man, the badly adjusted, stupid one, is rightly doomed. Modern economic conditions make for a positivistic attitude in members as well as in leaders, in that they resemble each other more and more. [Such a transformation, although constantly challenged by tendencies in the opposite direction, strengthens Labor as a new force in social life.]<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p> <p>Not that inequality has decreased. Even statistics cannot hide the fact that the gap between the social power of a single worker and that of a single corporation president has widened and this difference is the real yardstick as far as social justice is concerned. And, while the unions, dealing in certain categories of labor, have been able to raise their prices, the whole weight of society is felt by other categories, organized or unorganized. There is, furthermore, the cleavage between members of unions and those who cannot afford to enter in them, between the members of privileged nations and those who, in this smaller-growing world, are exploited, not only by their own traditional elites, but also through the medium of these elites, by the ruling groups of the industrially more developed countries. The principle of exploitation has not changed at all. Marx’s prediction that private competitive industry would become increasingly unable to employ the bulk of the proletariat as wage earners in the production of consumer goods or machines for consumer goods has come true. As a consequence, the association of the masses against universal exploitation has been made even more difficult by the appearance of new antagonisms within the ranks of the oppressed masses themselves. The opposing interests of farmers and workers, colored and white labor, soldiers and civilians are complicated by those of the various categories of the employed. Since it is the trend of capitalistic society that ever greater parts of the middle classes lose their economic independence. This process engulfs almost the whole population. It forms a complement to the emancipation of large masses from economic stagnation and pauperization. The more the world becomes ripe for the realization of theoretical thought, the more theoretical thought and every human trait which points to it seem to vanish, and, wherever they become manifest, are wiped out pitilessly by ideological control mechanisms serving the monopolies both of Industry and of Labor. The conscious precautions taken by radio, press, and motion pictures are only a visible supplement to the unconscious trends necessitated by economic and social development. The persecution of any independent social thought represents none of the groups struggling for a greater share of power, and has no usefulness for any prevailing interest, is not only planned and practiced by the agencies of culture but takes place within each member of society. [There are however, some centers of resistance left within man. It is a counter-evidence against social pessimism that notwithstanding the continuous assault by collective patterns humanity is still alive, if not in the individual as a member of social groups at least in the individual as far as he is left alone.]<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p> <p>The power of collective patterns of monopolistic society goes far beyond the sphere of conscious influence. From the day of his birth, the individual is made to feel that there is only one way to get along in this world: by resigning his unlimited hope. This he can only achieve by imitation (<em>mimesis</em>). He continuously ruminates what he perceives around him not only consciously – he acquires judgment and notions much later – but with his whole being. Long before he can even speak, he echoes the gestures of the persons and things around him. Later on, he echoes the traits and attitudes of all the collectives at whose mercy he is: his family, his classmates, his athletic team and all the other teams which enforce a deeper conformity, a more radical surrender by complete assimilation than any father or teacher in the 19th century. By echoing, repeating, imitating the surroundings, by adapting himself to all the powerful groups to which he belongs, by transforming himself from a human being into a member of specific organized bodies, by reducing his potentialities to readiness and ability to conform to, and gain influence in, such bodies, he can finally manage to survive. It is survival by practicing the oldest biological means of survival: mimicry. Modern culture is a resurrection of oppressed mimetic practices. Just as the child repeats the words of his mother and the youngster, the brutality of his elders at whose hands he has suffered much, industrialized culture, the giant loudspeaker voice of monopolism, copies reality endlessly and boringly. All the ingenious devices of the amusement industry serve but to reproduce over and over again, without betraying the slightest revolt, scenes of life which are already dull and automatized when they happen in reality. Motion pictures, radio, popular biographies and novels shout incessantly the same rhythm: this is our groove, this is the rut of the great and the little ones, this is reality as it is and should be and will be. Even the words which could express a hope for something else than the fruits of success have been absorbed. On the one hand, beatitude – and everything which refers to the absolute – has been assimilated by confining the idea to religious edification as a leisure time function; it has become part of Sunday School vernacular. Happiness, on the other hand, has come to mean exactly the normal life of which thought, even religious thought, at certain times, contained a radical criticism. Language has been so thoroughly reduced to the function ascribed to it in positivistic theory; it has become just another tool in the giant apparatus of production in monopolistic society. Every sentence which is not equivalent to an operation in that apparatus appears to the layman just as meaningless as it is decried to be by contemporary semantics, whose doctrine actually implies that only the purely symbolic and the operational, that is, the purely senseless sentence makes sense. Under the pressure of the pragmatic totalities of today, man’s self-expression has become identical with his function in the prevailing system. Within himself as well as in others, man desperately represses any other impulse. Wherever he perceives an unadjusted longing, he feels an overwhelming wrath and fury, an utter rage which crashes down on everybody and everything which, by exhibiting the idea of complete fulfillment, forces him to curb and repress the longing anew. [It is just this spitefulness which indicates that humanity has not been completely absorbed by the repressive collectivization of man. It has a disquieting aspect for the rulers. In spite of their social and psychological victories, they sense that their hold over the masses is in jeopardy. This is why terror has to implement collectivization.]<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p> <p>In the earlier periods of bourgeois society as well as in the history of other forms of society, there existed a greater multitude of independent economic subjects who took care of their own individual property and maintained it against competitive social forces. Such times necessitated the fostering of relatively independent thought which by its very nature, its “objectivity,” is related to the interests of humanity. Against its own wishes, the society of middle class proprietors and, particularly, the professions related to the now-vanishing economic sphere of [distribution],<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> had to promote thinking which, whether they liked it or not, was antagonistic to class rule and domination. Today the individual in the course of his economic functions is never directly confronted with society. It is always his group, his association, his union, which takes care of his rights.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Therefore the very category of the individual, with its good and bad implications, is in a state of liquidation. Thought, unrelated to the interest of any established group, unrelated to the business of any industry, has lost its significance. It is considered vain and empty. That self same society which, in the fact of hunger and starvation in great areas of the world, leaves a considerable part of its machinery idle, that society which suppresses or shelves important inventions, and which, in the rare periods of full employment, devotes a tremendous part of its working hours to idiotic advertisements (for even what is left of culture boils itself down to advertisements and propaganda) or to the production of instruments of destruction, that self-same society to which these sinister luxuries are inherent, has made usefulness its gospel. Conversely it has stamped the only ultimate aim for which civilization could be useful, a luxury: truth as it envisages the realization of humanity instead of the domination of nature.</p> <p>However, the difference of the actual situation from other chapters of history should not be exaggerated. In the earlier periods mentioned above, the existence of independent thought in the middle classes was paid for by the miserable material condition of the working class even in the most highly developed countries. The revolutionary thinkers of the proletariat came from the middle- or upper-classes. Since that time, the working class as a whole has made tremendous progress. Its rationality, at least as far as it is able to express itself, is purely pragmatic, and therefore “particularistic,” like that of the rest of society; but the tremendous physical, organizational, and cultural pressure which is necessary to keep it in this state, the increased furor with which not only every trace of independent political practice but the expression of any independent thought or even the mere suspicion of the existence of such thought are hated and eventually persecuted, the hectic strengthening of all reactionary organizations and movements, betray the rising fear of the abolition of fear and repression. The feverish attempt to channel the ever greater fury which develops in the masses due to the necessity of repressing their own original longings, and to prevent that furor from being conquered by eventual insight into the ever increasing senselessness of that repression and into the real identity of human interests. Such channeling which has always been the business of the rulers, of their cultural and terroristic apparatus, has also become the business of labor organizations which, at the same time, lead labor into the struggle of competition and increase its strength. [The antagonism between the classes is reproduced within the structure of labor and especially within the labor unions themselves – although it is perhaps better veiled there than it ever has been in society as a whole. Docilely and without a hint of any opposing interests, the workers surrender part of their money to the mammoth trusts which trade in their labor.]<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p> <p>It is not so much the amount of the contributions which makes the labor leaders a kind of group of the ruling class, but the social control exercised by them on the basis of these contributions. Certainly a great part of their material interests is opposed to the interests of other competing groups but this holds true for all groups which have ever formed the ruling class: they all have fought each other. Their affinity springs from the source of their income. They all live on what they can grasp from the circulating surplus value. This also goes for the industrialist himself. The working hours under which his immediate supervision are spent on the production of surplus value do not correspond to the share he himself gets of the whole surplus value at the disposition of the ruling class. He receives his proof not as an industrialist but as a businessman; as such he has to compete with others in order to get as large an amount as possible out of the entire result of each production period. He is in the same position as those capitalists whose business is not directly productive, like the bankers, the entrepreneurs in the communications- or entertainment-industries, and all the liberal professions and activities [which are exercised by so-called ‘third persons.’]<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> All of them have to develop their skill of shrewd calculation, of not giving away everything without getting as much as possible in return, of becoming acceptable to stronger groups, of using their fellowman exclusively as a tool for strengthening their grip on society. This skill is not derived from conscious determination. People are determined to assume such an attitude towards life but awareness of their willingness stirs up counter-trends in their own minds and in the minds of the people upon whom they want to impose. The qualities necessary for ascent spring from the unconscious; they have become second nature in man. Be that as it may, these psychological qualities are indispensable. The liberalistic ideology that a man’s fate depends on the economic significance of his activity demands two corrections. First, economic significance in this society means usefulness not with regard to the needs of all but with regard to essential conditions of the hierarchy of power. In order to be allowed to live, the individual must prove his value to some of the groups which are engaged in their struggle for a greater share of control over national and international economy. Second, the quantity and quality of goods or services which an individual contributes to the wealth of society is but one of the factors which determine his success.</p> <p>The more the economy is rationalized the more obvious it becomes that the differences of intelligence needed for the various functions could easily be overcome by adequate training. Under such conditions adaptability to the prevailing power relations rather than any other personal trait becomes paramount. It has been the fallacy of technocratic thinking from St. Simon to Veblen to underestimate the similarity of promising character traits in the different branches of production and of business and to confound rational use of the means of production with rational inclinations of certain categories of its agents.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> The engineer, indeed, embodies progress. He looks at people not exclusively as means of profit-making. His function as commander is more directly linked to the requirements of the work itself; therefore, his orders bear on the signs of greater objectivity. His subordinates recognize at least part of his commands as founded in the nature of things and therefore rational in a universal sense. But even the essence of this rationality is not reason but domination. The engineer’s understanding of things regards none of their elements by which they can be handled and transformed – their weakest points, so to speak. He is not interested in things as they really are but as they can be fitted into schema completely alien to their own nature. In fact his methods of thinking, his categories, lead necessarily to the triumph of modern technology: the smashing of atoms. No one is considered as an aim, all are mere tools. His mind is that of class society in its streamlined form, without any ornaments. His purposeful rule would make humanity a mass of utopia without any purpose.</p> <p>The labor leaders have become an acquisitive group among others. The conditions under which they work are more difficult. It is not so easy for them as for the leaders of the big capitalist trusts to keep their doings from discussion by a public opinion which in the last analysis is controlled by the entrepreneurs. [The large masses of members with whom the labor magnates have to deal, plus certain basically democratic patterns inherent in all non-fascist labor organizations, do not allow for the same conspiratory techniques which have been employed so successfully by big business in all its national and international undertakings. This is why the labor bureaucracy tries to dispense with membership meetings as much as possible. Every ruling minority needs secrecy as a condition of its perpetuation. Despite all these essential differences, however, the similarity between the organized totality of Labor and other monopolies should not be underrated.]<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>Each of the capitalist, professional and labor groups exercise specific functions in the social process and each uses that function to get as large a share of power over men, goods and services as possible. There have been, throughout history, diverse methods employed in this struggle: competition, swindles, robbery, war. This struggle which, as pointed out in the beginning, characterizes the set-up of each ruling class as definitely in its role in production, has become a trait of the labor groups today. Although labor leaders cannot achieve any results without obtaining, at least temporarily, some advantages for the workers. But their own social and economic power, their own position and income (all these factors overwhelmingly superior to the power, position, and income of the individual worker) depend on the maintenance of capitalism. This economic fact holds true despite the great services they may render to their respective memberships. The entrepreneur’s activities too very often had a positive effect on the income of labor; higher incomes of the entrepreneurs are no more opposed to the interests of labor than higher incomes of the labor leaders. But there is now a new kind of solidarity between the old and the new elites; social history during the last decades has brought closer cooperation between them. The attitude of the great labor unions towards the State in the last several decades was similar to that of the big capitalistic organizations. They were concerned with preventing the government from mingling in their affairs. “No interference with or without our private business” was their doctrine.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> [It was the “<em>Herr im Hause</em>” standpoint.]<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> [In the meantime the increasing economic power of monopolies has made understanding the central government imperative for labor leaders, and the same understanding is important for the government.]<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> The integration of cooperative elements into the administration has made progress during the war. Society becomes a planned and regulated process, not with regard to great events (they still depend on blind forces resulting from the struggle between the classes and among the various ruling groups), but as far as the life of the individual is concerned; not in the sense of self-administration (the decisions are made as compromises among the prominent whose interests do not correspond to those of the rest of society) but with regard to a more streamlined performance of the material and human apparatus of production.</p> <p>It is possible that once the strongest capitalistic groups gain direct control of the state, the labor bureaucracy will be abolished as well as the governmental one, and be replaced by more dependable commissioners of big business. Although this could be achieved without a formal change of constitutional principles, it would mean a development similar to that in Germany. It is also possible that labor in its actual structure will acquire an even stronger portion of the set-up to come. In both cases the material condition of labor may temporarily improve in the ruler states of the future at the expense of the vanquished as well as the vassal nations but at the same time the gap between the significance of a single member and of the prominent functionaries will deepen, the impotence of the human individual will become more marked, and the differences in wage according to sex, age, industrial and race groups will increase. This will bring about the triumph of particularistic rationality within the workers and their complete disillusionment. They will fit even more completely into the system and, at the same time, become more obstinate against its exacting requirements. Concomitant with all the labor saving devices, which the workers expertly enjoy, is an ever-increasing personal discontent and an economical attitude towards any expenditure of labor power. No one wants to be a sucker. True, the technological process has not made the workers revolutionary but refractory, insubordinate, difficult to handle. While formerly the ruling class could use sweeping ideologies which were good enough for the whole population, monopolism has had to develop quite a science of Personnel Management. Big plants today keep specialists who cater to the personal problems of the single worker. They adapt the smartest techniques, such as resort places, abridged psycho-analysis, and Tschaikowskij symphonies over loudspeakers during working hours. All this accompanies an unabated terror against anyone who seriously opposes the system as such. Workers become a more and more disquieting factor within the whole setup of Monopolism by their very assimilation to its material and cultural patterns. They threaten to gain what this period destroys, namely, in individuality. Therefore capitalism itself tends to promote pseudo-collectivistic social patterns and fascist forms of government.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p> <p>Gradual abolishment of the market as a regulator of production is a symptom of the vanishing influence of anything outside the decisive groups.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> True, the needs which, in the market system, made themselves felt in a most distorted anonymous and irrational form, can now be determined by statistics and be satisfied or rejected in accordance with the policy of the rulers. But if this new rationality is in one way closer to the idea of reason than the market system, it is in another way farther from it. Dealings between the ruling and the ruled were really determined not by the market but by the unequal distribution of power as it was expressed in the property of the means of production; yet the transformation of human relations into objective economic mechanisms granted the individual, at least in principle, a certain independence; domination was humanized by dehumanized, that is to say, intermediary, spheres. Today the expression of human needs is distorted no longer by the dubious economic indicators of the market, but by their conscious molding in a giant system of socio-psychological surgery. The misery of unsuccessful competitors and of backward groups can no longer be ascribed to anonymous processes which permitted a distinction between them as economic subjects and as human beings. The downfall of vanquished opponents, competitors as well as whole social strata, minorities and nations, is decided upon by the elites. Those who are to suffer are singled out and called by their names. However, the insidious policies of economic leaders today are as private and particularistic, and therefore perhaps even blinder with regard to the real needs of society, than the automatic trends which once determined the market. It is still irrationality which shapes the fate of humans. This does not mean that reason is not maintained by any individuals or groups at all. There are more people today who have real insight into the economic situation and its potentialities than at any other period. Their chances seem to have improved by the progress of methods of production, communication, and planning, and by the decomposition of all kinds of superstitions. Actually, the positions of thought have deteriorated by the perfection of the methods of domination, by the extinction of theoretical thought and by the new and stronger taboos resulting from the pseudo enlightened philosophy of [pragmatism, which expresses the abandoning of unintegrated thought.]<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p> <p>Under monopolism and totalitarianism the perennial nature of domination, its parasitic character, becomes blatant. Each ruling class has always been monopolistic in so far as it has fenced itself off from the overwhelming majority of individuals. The structure has been that of competing rackets. Even the socially expedient functions which the ruling classes have fulfilled, have been turned into weapons against the underlying population and against the competing groups of their own class. The racket-pattern which has been typical of the behavior of the rulers toward the ruled is now representative of all human relations, even those within Labor.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p> <p>The similarity of the most respectable historical entities as, for instance, the hierarchies of the Middle Ages, to modern rackets, is obvious. The concept of racket therefore refers to the big as well as to the small units; they all struggle for as great a share as possible of the surplus value. In this respect the highest capitalistic bodies resemble the little pressure groups working within or without the pale of the law among the most miserable strata of the population. Emphasis is to be laid on the fact that the role of a group in production though determining to a great extent its share of consumption, has been in class society a good strategic position for grasping as much goods and services as possible in the sphere of distribution. This is particularly the case in periods when the mode of production to which its leaders stick so tenaciously has become obsolete. They make use of their productive apparatus as robbers make use of their guns. What the petty illegal racket has been to the particular branch of business which it “protected” and fleeced, the class, which constitutes the total of its under-rackets, has been so society as a whole. In the contemporary slang-use of rackets as an equivalent for any profitable job there may be no conscious thought of these implications. But objectively, such use of the term expresses the idea that in present-day society every activity, whatever it may be, has as its content and goal no interest other than the acquisition of as large a part as possible of the circulating surplus value. The attempt to monopolize an economic function, is for the sake neither of production nor satisfaction of needs. The label of “unproductivity” used against all sorts of activities and even against whole groups belies the constant fear that anything one does may be useless, seems to originate in an unconscious fear that all the hectic activity in this pragmatic society is labor of Sisyphus. Industry overcomes its own awareness and society’s realization that production is a mere stronghold in the fight for prey by adopting production as a kind of religious creed, by promoting technocratic ideas and attaching the “unproductive” label to other groups, which do not even have an access to the big industrial bastions. It is a mechanism similar to the one which produced the terroristic rackets in 16th and 17th century Europe, which killed hundreds of thousands of unfortunates and wiped out the female population of whole counties for their alleged intercourse with Satan. These torturing, murderous, predatory rackets exalted all the more fervently the tortured, murdered, robbed God on the cross, and adored all the more devoutly the Virgin for her conception through the holy spirit. Today the rackets propagate productivity and common spirit, persecute as “racket” each person or group which refuses to join them, and as destructive, each undertaking which tries to put an end to destruction. Those who accomplish repression by an ocean of spoken and written words watch jealously, lest a single “unrelated” sentence be heard.</p> <p>A true sociology of the racket as the living [element]<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> of the ruling class in history could serve both a political and a scientific purpose. It could help clarify the goal of political practice: a society whose pattern is different from that of the racket, a racketless society. It could serve to define the idea of Democracy which still leads an underground existence in the minds of individuals. Today rackets have adapted this idea to their economic and political practices. They have slyly formalized political concepts and thus made expert political cliques dominating whole groups and states into champions of Democracy. Conversely they brand humanist theoreticians as advocates of dictatorship, for they have tried to promote and practice, no matter how inadequately, democratic contents. Despite all this, the meaning of Democracy, deeply connected with that of truth, is not forgotten. It needs to be expressed against a world which is more repressive and hostile than ever and against the shrewdest tactics of stupidity. Scientifically the sociology of the racket could yield a more adequate philosophy of history. Moreover, it could help throw more light upon many issues in the realm of humanities, even upon such remote and controversial problems as the initiation rites and patriarchal rackets of magicians in primitive tribes. It would show that the “breaking” of young men at the occasion of their entrance into such tribes represented acceptance, not as much into the community as such as into a particularistic social totality. Very similar observations can be made with regard to the relation of adults and children through the Middle Ages up to the beginnings of the 19th century. Adults, with regard to the children, behaved as a totality. The racket was also the pattern of the organization of males with regard to females. The modern concept serves to describe past social relations. “The anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the monkey.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> <p><br/></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>(Editor’s note:) Replaced by “materialist theory of history” in (1a) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>(Editor’s note:) Horkheimer’s substitution in (1a): “Marx has pointed out both the positive and the negative aspects of competition, (…)” <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>(Editor’s note:) (1a): “accuse” (handwritten insertion) <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>(Horkheimer’s footnote:) The term “totality” in the above sense of an organized structure will be so employed throughout this discussion. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:5"> <p>(Editor’s note:) From version in (1c), crossed out in (1b) and (1a).

The concept of class in its universal aspect, as typical for social theory, played an essential role in American sociology when it was young. Later on, emphasis was laid upon investigations in the light of which such concepts appear increasingly metaphysical. In our opinion the basis of this development is to be sought rather in the social process, to which we refer, than in the process of science itself. The time when sociology believed in its “larger task of constructing theoretical systems of social structure and social change,” the period before the first world war, was marked “by the general belief that theoretical sociology would somehow play a major constructive role in the progressive development of our society; sociology had the grandiose ambitions of youth.” (Charles H. Page, <em>Class and American Sociology</em>, New York 1940, p. 249). By this time its ambitions are certainly different.

The various laws resulting in the abolition of this right ratified the verdict against the existence of the independent economic subject. They put the dot on the ‘i’ of all trends and which abolished the liberal world. Gold in private possession for the owner provided a certain protection against the vacillations of the economy. Even modest property, guaranteed within certain limits, a life which was not entirely absorbed by participation in the economic process. The relative stability of the value of that particular merchandise endowed its owner with a force of resistance against his complete integration into the social mechanism, this resistance expressed itself in a certain degree of autonomy by which bourgeois culture was characterized. The more or less independent position of money for gold showed in his own mentality as well as in his literature and art. Culture obeyed its own laws to a certain extent and contained a criticism not only with regard to specific and concrete points of reality but also of its basic structure. Gold within the reach of any economic subject made the bourgeois individual somehow the successor of the aristocrat. The bourgeois could provide security for himself and make reasonably sure that even after his death his dependents would not have to submit totally to society. This freedom on the one hand excluded the masses, but, on the other hand, created cultural forms opposing this same exclusiveness. Today, no one can expect to find a place to lead a life of his own. He has to surrender completely: not to human solidarity but to the social process of monopoly. There are no safety-zones on the thoroughfare of society. Everyone must keep moving. Monopolism does not tolerate the beggar. But the beggar, whom the <em>Rentier</em> had always wanted to see removed from the streets, takes him along to the realm of the anguished. [*] Exemption from work, “privacy” voluntary or involuntary, bore witness to the existence of a non-totalitarian order. Gold in private possession was the sign of bourgeois rule. Its transfer to the state is the sign of monopoly.

What was already clear to everyone except for the professors in the times of so-called liberalism—namely, that the words ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ concealed the true cause of economic processes—has now dawned on them as well, for a simple reason. Whereas in earlier times, those concepts directly stood in for wealth management, profiteering, and exploitation, today the state, with which its sponsors are not in complete agreement for the time being, is recognized as the mediator between these factors and fluctuations in supply and demand. Now, just as the government has been found behind the veil of economics [<em>ökonomischen</em> <em>Schleier</em>] instead of naked relations of exploitation, economists declare the laws of the market have been replaced by historical, political, and psychological laws instead. They’ve taken this into account in actuality as well. The progressives and reformists among them move on to the late-democratic administrations which, on the grounds of the incompatibility of capitalism and concrete democracy, are increasingly isolated, increasingly powerless bureaucracies and, ultimately, replaced by ruling agencies [<em>Herrschaftsinstanzen</em>] more adequate to monopoly. The more fortunate majority of economic experts, even when they collaborate with wartime administrations, hold themselves back in reserve until the bright capitalist sun breaks through the clouds once more.</p> <p>However, the concept of economy they have declared obsolete is now more real than ever before. They were already disavowing it when there were still openings for professorships in economic theory. Only, in those days it was not done by liquidation of the word itself, but by its false substitution with so-called ‘national economy.’ Instead of getting to the bottom of the mode by which society produces and reproduces its material life, they investigated price-formation, economic cycles, and fluctuations of the stock market in a vacuum. Even then, out of embarrassment, they dismissed any considerations of the data which might bring out the connection between the transactions of the entrepreneur to actual power-relations as ‘extra-economic’; now, all of a sudden, the ultimate cause [<em>die Endursache</em>] is supposed to be the real confrontation between state power and national and international factors. But just as ‘national economy’ once veiled economic reality by hypostasizing market processes, now the increase of concentration on politics—or, at best, on technology—effectively prevents cognition of the facts of the matter. This is the regression of bourgeois theory to its early stages, to Cardano and Machiavelli. The regression, however, is not the repetition but the distortion of the original state of affairs. [The rediscovery of politics, which in the Renaissance was a theoretical advance, has become in thinking under monopoly a category more ideological than the laws of the market were under liberalism: with its help, the surface is hypostasized. The dominated masses attribute world events to politics—hearing only appeal and degree, keeping themselves informed about the lives of the high and mighty, facts which need no theory. The masses experience the immediate consequences of political acts, of negotiations of rackets; they feel the effects of the emergency assistance, the inflation, the new job, the war and take big politics for fate and nature just as they once did the economic depression. And each of the protagonists shares in this belief: they know they hold a key position. Just as the entrepreneur confused his business ventures undertaken on the basis of economic cycles, his calculations and his speculations, with freedom, the presidents of trade unions and governments mistake their decisions for initiation of causal chains.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Governing, however, must defer to the same necessities as asset management: to the requirements of the reproduction of society in the form of power relations as they are. In this, there is little difference between the two periods. The unsurveyability of the market from which the self-deception of freedom arose had only expressed the fact that the relationships between entrepreneurs amongst themselves were not rational, but relationships of individual self-assertion. Today the struggles take place in much stronger groups, amongst the movements of the most concentrated masses of capital. The governments are executive apparatuses which cannot rationally penetrate the current balance of forces on which they depend, but feel their effects concretely.] They would be free, if…<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p> <h2 id="rackets-and-spirit-194244">Rackets and Spirit (1942/44)</h2> <p>The basic form of domination is the racket.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> It is possible, as some have assumed, that a single tyrant directed and protected the whole of the primal horde, but even in this case the gradation of strength between him and the weakest member of the horde establishes a hierarchy.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The next-strongest of the men guard their privileges over their lessers just as the patriarch guards his own over them. With the invention of tools, the order of rank is no longer determined by physical force alone, but just as much by the way of life prescribed to human beings by the nature of their tools. Better weapons, methods for cultivating the soil, in combination with a more suitable condition of the land, make a more abundant existence possible. Once a new stage is reached, regression into an earlier one is prevented not merely by new habits and needs in general, but also by the splitting of interests established on the basis of new methods. Unique requirements and the skills which correspond to them are formed and developed by certain individuals and groups, in opposition to the rest of society according to the positions they hold in the new division of labor. Through these abilities, the occupation of key positions in the social apparatus, the hierarchy of power, originally and exclusively grounded on natural potencies, undergoes modification until, in the course of social development, hierarchy ultimately corresponds to second, social nature—no longer to strength, but position. That first nature upon which society is grounded still is mutilated and enslaved.</p> <p>The divorce of above from below, dominators from dominated, rests on the organization of each individual power-group in itself and its opposition to those below it. Towards the top, each group is relatively amorphous, since, in the long run, their form of organization is molded by the strenuous effort not to slide towards the bottom. Organizations with the tips of their spears pointed upwards have no place in the established hierarchy, are without regular economic function, and, after periods of illegality, are brought back to life in revolutionary actions. In history thus far, whenever such undertakings were victorious, groups of functionaries and their clients replaced them in the modified hierarchy and hardened themselves downwards. These groups maintain their social function or adopt a new one, which, from then on, they monopolize. ‘Hardening’ means monopolizing the advantages which can be extorted on the grounds of a determinate, regular performance within the social process. One such hardening of a function—which would prove decisive—was private ownership of the means of production, namely the command over commodity-production in the age of industrialization.</p> <p>The most general category of group-executed functions is that of protection. Groups maintain the conditions for the continuation of the division of labor in which they have preferential standing, upholding their monopoly and warding off the changes which might endanger it. They are rackets. In each case, ‘ruling class’ means the structure of rackets on the grounds of a determinate mode of production, so far as they simultaneously protect and suppress the undermost strata. They may also be split amongst themselves according to the economic dynamics that shape their material interests; indeed, they may, consciously or unconsciously, perpetuate and even intensify the splitting so far as their protective functions are strengthened in the process. The relation of the ruling class to the unification of domination has always been a complicated one. The ambivalent relationship between the powers of empire and papacy in the joint suppression of centrifugal forces through the middle ages was more advantageous for each than the fusion of the two powers would have been. Even the maintenance of the nation-states only served a part of the special interests of the national bureaucracy, but to the benefit of the system of rackets as a whole.</p> <p>The downwards-hardening of rackets is identical with the hardening of the individuals who constitute them, something which has been consciously pursued throughout the whole of history. For the sake of one’s own children, this is what their education consisted of. Only in the liberalistic periods, in which a certain sector of rackets couldn’t be totally devoid of more obliging qualities for economic reasons, did [education] take on humane features. Prior to this, [education] was as cruel as the initiation-rites of the primitive tribe, which was already a racket itself. For individuals who lacked a rightful claim on the grounds of their descent to be integrated into a racket, the procedure was not like the incorporation of the youth into their own tribe, but rather like their consecration into the elect racket of the sorcerers. This demands the complete breaking of one’s personality, absolutely binding guarantees of one’s future faithfulness. The individual must relinquish all power, burn all of their bridges behind them. The true Leviathan, the racket demands the unqualified acceptance of the social contract. A continuum of smooth transitions runs from the sacrifice one’s own mother, which the would-be mage must make as an offering to the racket of sorcerers, to the dissertations of the universities, through which the adept must prove their thinking, feeling, and speaking have irrevocably taken on the forms of the racket of the academy. In certain situations, the outsider’s capacity for achievement may make them an attractive prospect for the racket, but it never entitles them to being incorporated into it. Official legal titles [<em>Rechtstitel</em>] merely attest to membership in a racket; thereby, the state, signing on behalf of all, certifies that the holder belongs to a racket and is thus integrated into the system. Legal titles and illegal titles, membership to the world and membership to the underworld, are distinguished by the fact that the world has at its disposal an all-embracing organization, a protection none shall escape; whoever is proscribed by its agencies is truly forsaken. Even during open conflicts between their umbrella organizations, one regards the individual with whom the other side had all-too serious difficulties with serious suspicion. It cannot be in any doubt that their defection from the one camp to the other is motivated by circumstances extraneous to their essential relation with it, not by their lack of adaptability to it. The Volscians welcomed the fugitive Coriolanus, whose affinity for domination shone far and wide, with open arms. After all, he was a man of the rackets of the gentiles and possessed the qualities of a field general, which are always a recommendation. The fugitive slave, however, is the symbol of the opposite.</p> <p>When an organization is so powerful that it can enforce its will upon a geographical area as permanent rule over the conduct of all its inhabitants, the domination of persons takes the form of laws [<em>Gesetze</em>]. This fixes relative power-relations. As a fixed medium, law [<em>Recht</em>], like other mediations, acquires a nature and force of resistance all its own. In becoming a substantial element of spirit, it incorporates the harmony of universality and particularity as a necessary idea. The sense and purpose of the law [<em>Recht</em>], to serve as the guideline for social life, is conditional upon its disregard for the determinate person and for their past, its validity for and against each and all under its remit until it is openly repealed. The means of domination oppose it as the reflection by which it unmasks itself. Increasingly closed off to those below, with the consolidation of monopoly, the totalitarian shape of society wages war against the law [<em>Recht</em>], against all mediations which have acquired a life of their own and existence in the forms of language. The fundamental illegality of the racket stands opposed to the spirit, even where the racket is not only legal, but stands behind the laws themselves. For as long as legality has existed, it has borne the features of illegality. The racket knows no mercy to life outside itself, but only the law of self-preservation. Under monopoly, language petrifies into a system of signs, more mute and expressionless than morse-code and the tapping-systems of prisoners. Language loses its sense of expression completely. It becomes a mechanism in production, like levers or wires, machinery for the calculations of administration, the embodiment of techniques of suggestion. The spiritual intercourse of individuals is reduced to the display and detection of identification tags. Speech either proves the speaker dependable enough for the rackets or betrays them as the conspirator who flashes the tip of their dagger. Petrified language points in accusation towards heaven like bare tree stumps on abandoned battlefields: it denounces the world of rackets it must yet serve. The mother-bomb launched from its airplane discharges twenty smaller bombs, tearing the fruit of mothers to shreds not once but twenty times over, stands accused for its hellish vocation precisely by the name ‘mother’ under which it has been advertised. The dead woods of words of our era will still bear witness against it after it has passed.</p> <p>Every racket conspires against the spirit; all conspire against and among one another. The reconciliation of universal and particular is immanent to the spirit; the racket is their irreconcilable opposition, though concealed behind ideas of unity and community. The evil is not domination in itself, but the final hardening of domination that defines the racket. From the whispering of the council of the elders in the primitive tribe to the understanding reached between industry and army in private clubs and boardrooms, domination provides the historical documentation of its bad consciences. The brutality of the underclasses, from which the secret of the ruling must be kept, is nothing original, but socially generated. The terrible, bloodthirsty ‘Collective’ that traverses the history of humanity is but the other face of the exclusionary rackets, consciously or unconsciously generated by them. The worn-out costumes of the aristocrats live on as ethnic dress [<em>Volkstrachten</em>], the rackets of the ruling class as the brutality of the stronger towards the weaker, as the indescribable viciousness of the mob towards the powerless. This is the racket of the little man, degenerated cultural heritage. The rackets have always pointed to the fearsomeness of the collectives they generate and direct as the ground of their own necessity, and the unholy naivete of the historian has accordingly mistaken the disfigured grimace of the masses for bare nature. To date, the racket has impressed its stamp on all social appearances; it has ruled as racket of the clergy, the court, the propertied, the race, the men, the adults, the family, the police, the criminal—and within these media themselves, in the form of individual rackets over the rest of their sphere. Everywhere it has set up the opposition between inner and outer; the man who belonged to no racket was outside in a radical sense—he was forsaken. Even in the heads of the isolated [<em>Vereinzelten</em>], rackets still ruled by means of their concepts and the schemata of judgment, the mode and content of thinking stemming from their world. To break through the boundary between inside and outside is the goal of politics, which, if fulfilled, would transform the world. In the true idea of democracy—which even now leads a repressed, subterranean existence among the masses—an intimation of a society free of the racket has never completely died out. To unfold this idea would mean breaking through the ticket of suggestion which still presses the true critique of the racket into its service [… and even now prepares to spread the fascist dictatorship of the industrial monopolies across the surface of the earth under the guise of an attack on the weakened rackets of finance capital.]<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p> <h2 id="history-of-the-american-labor-force-194244">History of the American Labor Force (1942/44)</h2> <p>The historical course of the proletariat led to a crossroads: it could become a class or a racket.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Racket meant privileges within national borders, class meant world revolution. The leaders have relieved the proletariat of this decision.</p> <h2 id="on-the-philosophy-of-law-194244">On the Philosophy of Law (1942/44)</h2> <p>It has been said that punishment arose from revenge.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Society removes such business from the hands of the injured party. Judiciary [<em>Justiz</em>] is an early state monopoly, administered by the authoritative rackets. The separation of powers—of the making, applying, and executing of laws [<em>Gesetze</em>]—then arose as a protective measure for the citizens [<em>Bürger</em>] against the executive. They wanted to get the bureaucracy under control, to limit its arbitrariness, according to their interests. With the concentration of their class today, the need for the division of powers disappears; new rackets unite the powers in their hands, and the idea of universality wanes with the waxing of corruption of parliaments.</p> <p>Since the replacement of revenge by the state—which constitutes the state as its ground, whether it arises through internal development or conquest—there have been many theories of punishment as far as the citizens of the state [<em>Staatsbürger</em>] were concerned; to the slaves and serfs, it was an admitted means of terror. Punishment is rationalized as retribution, restoration, deterrence, protection, and education. Without punishment, society cannot exist, and this sign of its weakness is simultaneously its mark of shame, branding it as the very nature above which it seeks to rise.</p> <p>All of their theories dissolve—that is, in execution. However reasonable their ground for inflicting pain may be, the pain is senseless. Contra medicine, the purpose of punishment is pain. Pain is not the undesired but desired effect of each and every punitive measure. The achievement of its moral purpose, with which it may excuse itself, is questionable and immoral. The power that methodically turns pain against the powerless turns it into means of its own dark ends, hidden behind morality. The enemy is never the object of punishment, for it is always administered to the defenseless. Clearer than through any other institution, it is through punishment society shows it represents not universality but particularity, even if it were that of the majority, excepting only the one who is punished. Every human being could attain universality through insight; there would be no need for pain. Recourse to pain is the confession of the illegality of law [<em>der Illegalität des Rechts</em>].</p> <p>In class society, the particularity is quite pronounced. The laws [<em>Gesetze</em>] are set in pre-established harmony with the rule of cliques which hold weapons and means of production. Religion, especially protestantism, has taken it upon itself to support such domination through the emphasis on evil, through which it glorifies punishment. Before power, this anthropology points upwards with one finger and respectfully bows; before powerlessness, it justifies punishment as divine institution, like poverty and war. But even the overwhelming majority which must resort to punishment is still the false; whoever transfigures it commits idolatry, as did Luther, conscripting spirit in the service of domination to which the flesh is fettered out of fear and need. To the reality of misery, he added the lie that the states and rulers whose ravage fills history, whose ravage is history itself, has a sacred significance. Such a lie was unthinkable before the concept of spirit, which first entered into the world through Christianity and would surely transform it in turn. Such a lie pollutes the Christian centuries.</p> <h2 id="solidarity-19421944">Solidarity (1942/1944)</h2> <p>Solidarity is grounded on shared knowledge.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Due to the necessary inconclusivity of knowing, it seems solidarity is necessarily fleeting. The insights which once bound human beings to one another might prove incorrect. The ruptures in French schools of poetry and painting through the last century, the sworn enmity of friends over a principle, the factional splits between the smallest groups and groupuscules of the extreme left—in any event, these schisms do them more honor than the prudent coherence does psychoanalytic and political gangs.</p> <p>On closer inspection, however, there are motives beyond the theoretical one at the root of those eternal feuds of the old <em>Bohème</em>. In negation of an earlier state of knowledge, it is not crossed out but overcome by determinate negation. The transition is demanded by the thing itself [<em>die Sache selbst</em>], it is inherent within it. The slackening of intellectual forces may keep the individual from carrying this out on their own. However, once this step has been taken by anyone, only the pettiest individual [<em>individuelle</em>] interests can determine the individual [<em>Einzelnen</em>] to defend the duller, more limited mode of thinking against the more precise, richer one. This is neither blind adherence nor mere fidelity, for the more primitive consciousness is always better off when taken up by a more differentiated consciousness than it is by itself. There are mechanical obstacles which stand like walls between the subject and historically adequate knowledge, such that the subject cannot perceive it, even if it exists. But this is why the old and the new are not of equal cognitive standing.</p> <p>According to Marx’s insight, proletarian class interest should not simply oppose the bourgeois, but objectively be the higher. The power of the insight [<em>Einsichtigkeit</em>] into this objectivity facilitated the defection of the sons of the bourgeoisie over to the side of the struggling workers. The reverse path, from the proletarian to the bourgeoise, was betrayal—betrayal of truth, as much as it was for the remaining bourgeoisie to remain in an ideology which had long since become transparent as such. They were not cut off from knowledge by social fact, but by the obstinate narrowing of their own horizons for private advantage. For so long they were resolved to disclaim, to turn away from what they hypocritically cried out were the highest of values—religion and truth, love of humanity and justice—until they had become too stupid for private advantage itself and are now, for all their pedantic cleverness, rightly reduced to nothing.</p> <p>Considerations for career tempered the disputes of the <em>Bohème</em>. Whatever in solidarity is threatened by the process of knowing is that which is still impure and bad in it. Not a few communities have fallen apart without solidarity being extinguished. Every once in a while, it was picked up by a single one abandoned by all.</p> <h2 id="a-theory-of-the-criminal-19431944">A Theory of the Criminal (1943/1944)</h2> <p>The more fragmented it was, the more mediated domination was.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Individual property owners did not keep the poor down as the feudal lord and the oriental despot had with satraps and personal guards, the simple continuation of barbaric-physical violence; their will had to be objectified in law, and so limit the totality of the power it represents. Law [<em>Gesetz</em>] as means of domination develops a logic of its own, an opposition to domination which cannot be overcome by sending out silk thread. Whoever offends in bourgeois society is no longer taboo like the transgressor of primitive solidarity, no longer the rebellious slave or serf. The offender does not merely stand outside their society, but is rather the exponent of a conflict which resides within that society itself. The social principle to which the law owes its existence is reproduced in the criminal. Even through the religious hymn to the worldly sword of the executioner [<em>Richtschwert</em>] of which Protestantism sang, the human-inhuman origin of law [<em>Recht</em>] shines through, the will of the minority giving itself the form of the majority. The many lords who, though in competition with one another, sought to control the authorities, had to grant a kind of autonomy not only for their own economic command but also to the protection against the competing, executive organs of terror, so they took up the law. Criminal law protects the citizen not only from the crime, but also from the state supposed to avenge it. The perpetrator, the outsider, is still thought of as an individual. Bourgeois criminal law goes back to the civil law of the primitives rather than the measures against the transgressors, so far as one can speak of such a law at all. Positive law, “governing all the phases of tribal life,” says Malinowski, “consists… of a body of binding obligations, regarded as a right by one party and acknowledged as a duty by the other, kept in force by a specific mechanism of reciprocity and publicity inherent in the structure of their society. … Their stringency is ensured through the rational appreciation of cause and effect by the natives, combined with a number of social and personal sentiments… .”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> The formulation of principles and laws belongs to exchange. It is connected with the consolidation of private property,<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> which, ultimately, makes human beings into subjects. The market comes by its opposite honestly; the market, like money, demands the law. There is an affinity between the two media of the economy [viz., law and money]. They are universal in form: one cannot tell from the law itself where it will have effect, nor from money where it comes—although in actuality, one is drawn to the poor, the other to the rich. Precisely the neutrality of the media, their formal universality, determines the member of the bourgeois world as subject, which is the same in all. These [media] first create the concept of the human being. Personality has at least rudimentary legal relations [<em>Rechtsverhältnisse</em>], a universal for its presupposition. The criminal counts on such universality. So far as his <em>ratio</em> extends, he grabs hold of the chances that flow his way from the anonymity of the means which make him equal as well. The accursed, godforsaken, the poor sinner, affront to gods and men, is the violator of the articles of the law; the criminal, a product of humanity.</p> <p>The deception—as if among the bourgeois there were criminals other than the perpetrators of crimes against property—is ideology in the truest sense: illusory semblance to which individuals are necessarily subject given their role in the social process. Murder is certainly no longer punished less than theft, as in periods of scarcity of goods and labor. Since the Lord said <em>vengeance is mine</em>, the state has monopolized the system of vengeance, to which the individual is held to account whether they commit sacrilege, sexual murder, embezzlement, or theft. The business of the state requires uniform guidelines. Even juridical concepts are subject to leveling. Their opposition to one another is erased as every violation is measured by the same measure according to a common denominator of punishment. This reduction was accomplished according to the schema of property. The category of the commodity has taken hold of all branches of human intercourse to the effect that even life and limb are understood, attacked, or kept under guard according to the model of property. Everything within reach of human beings becomes something at someone’s disposal, an object of the legal subject [<em>Gegenstand</em> <em>des Rechtssubjekts</em>]. The law [<em>das</em> <em>Recht</em>] was even involved in the constitution of the body itself. Just as each logical classification points back to painful separations in actuality, so too do the parts of the body point back to the oldest proprietary rights [<em>Rechtsschutz</em>]. Any injury to the Lord and to his ‘hands’ [<em>Gesindes</em>]<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> had a price corresponding to the impairment [<em>Beeinträchtigung</em>] resulting from the loss. The hand was dearer than the ear. The parts of the body [<em>Körperteile</em>] belong to the body, and the body belongs to the person. The state protected its ‘member’<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> as the owner of his body [<em>Leibes</em>], and under such protection [<em>Schutz</em>] the individual formed as the embodiment of the psychological. Proprietary right over the body is a special case of the protection of private property. The bloom of criminal law coincides with those times in which the central state identified its internal peace with the security of property.</p> <p>In the concept of the criminal, bourgeois society reassures itself that it knows how to unify universal and particular interest, for only so far as it guarantees self-preservation to each can it condemn by [its] reason what it prosecutes by [its] particularism. The theoretical concept of the crime cannot be separated from the construction of the state contract by which it obliges people into obedience to the state, given that they, for the sake of their own well-being, transferred the highest of powers over to it. “But by safety must be understood,” Hobbes writes, “not the sole preservation of life in what condition soever, but in order to its happiness. For to this end did men freely assemble themselves, and institute a government, that they might, as much as their human condition would afford, live delightfully.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Once the state contract is in effect, the criminal is in breach of his own pragmatic reason which confronts him as objective in the state. This defines the criminal in distinction from the evildoer. For bourgeois thinking, there is no sin but that against the principle of the self. The criminal violates consistent, organized self-preservation for the sake of the limited, anarchic. His prudence [<em>Klugheit</em>] comes up short. He is incapable of waiting. He is all-calculating yet wants for calculating intelligence. He is punished for his folly. Any other theory of punishment betrays society’s doubts about its own rationality. The concepts of state contract and reason are equivalent for the bourgeoisie. Society regards itself as concrete reason, the union of the rational who would protect themselves from nature in common. Towards those who do not pay for their incorporation with strict obedience, society itself administers the destructive force of nature, the very same from which society had provided them escape; society becomes a premeditated, systematic force of nature in comparison to which the unmediated force of nature, for all its cruelty, still appears the truer state of innocence.</p> <p>The stigma of the criminal is uselessness. He skips over the stage of production and seeks to appropriate as much circulating surplus value as possible for himself. The industrialist, businessman, advertising agent, professor stick to circulation as well, but in the fulfillment of their contract. The criminal, however, represents on the inside what the war presents to the outside: the capture of surplus value under the elimination of exchange. Robber barons, condottiere, volunteer corps [<em>Freischärler</em>], racketeers vacillate between warrior and criminal. Whichever pole they are assigned is not up to them, but to the given state of domestic and foreign policy. Crime is the deed <em>par excellence</em>, appropriation without exchange. It forms the naive counterpart to the ownership of property [<em>Besitz</em>], which, much like itself, creates no goods, either as manual or intellectual labor, and yet exacts its tribute, whether squeezing it directly from the factory or indirectly through interests and dividends. This secret kinship with crime, the social affinity of the poles: the privileged and the condemned, provokes the proprietor to revenge. He has the entirety of the armed forces on his side; the criminal, at best, a machine gun. But property ownership, without which there would be no ego nor conscience, consciencelessly suffers not another blackmailer besides it. The life lived on one’s own terms without service to the system trespasses against the divine order of things. Criminals and capitalists are only out for profit; they are not interested in any work. The ‘joy of work’ is an ideology of large-scale industry in the period already in the process of the liquidation of the bankers and the sphere of circulation as a whole: a conceptual schema for the administration of human beings under monopoly. The capitalistic criminal wasn’t violent from the start. As a burgher, he preferred profit without bloodshed to military actions. He only resorted to war and state of siege when the existence of the class was thrown into question or there were surplus profits to be obtained. The career criminal feels much the same. “In the execution of the crime, a ‘good’ criminal avoids unnecessary cruelty and murder. The thing to aim at is ‘big money.’ The risk is equal whether you are stealing seven or seventy thousand dollars. ‘I don’t look to kill anybody. If I can prevent it, I will. But I would shoot somebody to get away, if there’s plenty of money there, say $100,000.’”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> The criminal represents the more irrational, more primitive racket in comparison to the state-protected class monopoly. His profession points back to early-bourgeois and pre-bourgeois forms of domination; these continue to thrive in the present as Mafia and Camorra, despised like overthrown deities become demonic powers for the new religion. Contemporary domination perpetuates itself in forms, however destructive to human beings they may ultimately prove, through which social life is reproduced at the same time. The criminal, on the other hand, too weak to punch above his weight with his contemporaries, apes domination which has already become obsolete. He has no part in the social reproduction of life to the end of its domination. To this extent, he is destructive.</p> <p>Where bourgeois society confronts nature directly, production and destruction coincide. In the slaughterhouse, murder [<em>Totschlag</em>] is at one with the production of the means of life. But in the relation of the classes to one another, the functions are differentiated: the entrepreneur has command over production, the policeman hunts down the criminal. Violence is no less essential to the bourgeoisie than to those forms of society in which the sword and the whip were still in the hands of the master or of those in his immediate vicinity. Wherever one clan [<em>Sippe</em>] or class would reserve the possibility of a relatively secure life for itself while leaving the other to hunger, insecurity, and labor, it needs to maintain its hold upon the force to strike as well, whether in the shape of a club to repel strangers from entering one’s cave or the nightstick to murder prisoners in the cellar of the police precinct. Due to the division of labor, this force crystallizes into apparatuses of oppression on the reverse side of culture. In the penal system and the police, every instinct of destruction finds somewhere to hide. By contrast, the destruction brought about by crime is not assigned to it by the division of labor. It is merely a deduction from production. Despite Mandeville’s illuminating suggestions concerning the productivity of destruction in general, and the dependency of arts and trades on crime in particular<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>—which Marx complements with his own satirical apology for crime, in its significance for technology, economy, and culture<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>—it remains a mere ferment of reversion and dissolution. At best, the criminal becomes an honest bandit who murders for a fixed sum. He remains at this stage just as quack doctors and faith healers still linger at that of the alchemist in the transition to natural science. The criminal will not surrender his freedom nor pocket his winnings without becoming a member of the enterprise he succumbs to. He cannot make himself into a subject, no matter how hard he tries. Black Will, the cutthroat in <em>Arden of Feversham</em>,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> long before <em>The Beggar’s Opera</em>,<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> already exhibits the ethos of the businessman [<em>Ethos des Kaufmanns</em>] who keeps the contract even when it proves unfavorable. “I have had ten pound to steal a dog, and we have no more here to kill a man; but that a bargain is a bargain, … .”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> His ideal is that of security for the branch of industry in which he is employed. “Ah, that I might be set a work thus through the year, and that murder would grow to an occupation, that a man might follow without danger of the law: – zounds, I warrant I should be warden of the company!”<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Will is a thwarted entrepreneur. But private murder was a poor line of work anyway; it was only the object of regular commerce as long as commerce itself was half-taboo. With the police, it is another matter entirely: henchmen and hangmen who share in the crookedness of the criminal and the brutality of his profession, but not in his autonomy. Though their licensed violence functions for the sake of money as well, they are not paid for services rendered, nor in spoils like Black will, but receive a wage. The policeman, the state prosecutor, and the judge bear no responsibility for the existence and content of their profession; they are essentially instruments, and only have power as such. They thus consider themselves to be of a third degree because they publicly accept wages for the first. If the criminal is the crippled, retarded twin brother of the bourgeois, the police agent is his authorized representative [<em>Prokurist</em>]. The principle in both is the same: violence, without which bourgeois property cannot exist.</p> <p>In the deed of the criminal, however, the reversion into earlier stages of development is united with the most extreme consequence of progress: it negates taboos. In planning and execution, the criminal only takes the power of the law [<em>Gesetz</em>] and its servants into consideration, but not [power, not] the thing itself [<em>die</em> <em>Sache</em>]. The overcoming of fear before this thing was the way of the bourgeois spirit from the very beginning. After the dissolution of nature in things, however, which brought the evildoers to a halt, there is no reserve for it in humanity either. Humanity establishes its dominion without restriction. The radicality of this is revealed in crime. When bourgeois thinking set out to emancipate itself from shrinking back in terror, it shied away from nothing as crime. The result is that thinking and doing, each driven to their extreme, collapse into one another: the doing merely uncovers the powerlessness of things already realized for thinking. The content, the spirit of the thing, which the crime ignores, is the secret which, according to the enlightenment, does not exist at all. Thus the worship of blind violence out of desperation for rescue from the cycle of transgression and revenge, in which crime is mythical, is one with progress itself. The abstract self of the enlightenment, which can convert nature into propaganda because it is no longer arrested by any content within it, and only ever knows its own purposes, is in the crime shot through with the senselessness of totally objectified nature. It is the deed that shrinks back from nothing and yet remains the very shrinking of the primitive into whose soul no glimmer of rescue from the darkness of the cycle breaks: this is the deed that lights the way forward for the bourgeoisie on its path towards dynamic society.</p> <h1 id="internal-memos">Internal Memos</h1> <h2 id="la-memo-1942">LA Memo (1942)</h2> <p><strong>Memorandum. On parts of the Los Angeles work-program that cannot be carried out by the philosophers.</strong></p> <p>The total plan of the work relates to a comprehensive critique of present-day ideology.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Ideology is to be understood not only as the consciousness, but also the constitution of human beings in the present phase, i.e., anthropology in the sense the concept is used in “Egoism and Freedom Movements.” Particular emphasis is to be placed on the connection of the practical, “realistic” spirit—as has found its philosophical expression in pragmatism—and fascism. It is, however, not the underlying <em>thema probandum</em>. The emancipatory features of enlightenment and pragmatism should be worked out just as much as the repressive. The attack on dominant ideology should consist in a critical analysis of both decisive spiritual-intellectual spheres and mass culture. The success of such analyses essentially depends on their orientation to concrete insights into the most recent economic developments; for the whole aims at overcoming political stagnation.</p> <p>By no means is it to be thought of as a comprehensive presentation of the economic situation of the present and its theory. Rather, the economic parts should center on specific individual questions of great importance, all of which relate to the theory of classes.</p> <p>In the following, we will identify the individual problems which lie particularly close to our hearts. It should be self-evident that these questions can be reformulated by the economists.,</p> <ol> <li>What has become of the proletariat in the monopolistic-fascistic phase? Can it still be defined today in the sense it was in <em>Capital</em>? What effect has monopolization had on the differentiations within the proletariat? To what extent do changes in differentiation mean changes in class-consciousness, or in the structure and role of the party?</li> <li>What has become of the capitalist class? To what extent is the capitalist class in accord with itself, nationally and internationally? Relation between trade, finance, manufacturing and heavy industry. Stage of the process of concentration. What changes has capitalist class-consciousness undergone, and how to the capitalists stand in their attitude towards dominant ideologies, e.g., individualism and collectivism?</li> <li>The question of the class character of bureaucracy. We should arrive at a clear consensus about the present controversy. For this, it is probably necessary to trace bureaucratization back to its various roots (professional civil service, joint stock company, etc.). Particular attention should be paid to the problem of the separation—or fusion—of property titles and the power of disposal. Weight should also be given to the influence of technical changes, to the transition from mediated to immediate domination. The factory is developing from a business enterprise to an institution with its own “form of life,” consciously created “community,” mythology of order, and hierarchy. The role of oversight for managers in the various spheres of culture.</li> <li>Does technological differentiation lead to greater convergence or divergence of the various types of work? The chances for democracy in the future depend on the answer to this question. The most recent publication of the CIO on “Industrial Democracy” (Reuttenberg and another author) seems to contradict the thesis of progressive divergence represented by Pollock and Neumann against Marcuse.</li> <li>How does academic and non-academic discussion today stand with respect to Marxian theory? It would be of the utmost importance to first conduct a survey of this discussion to subsequently work through in a critical manner. What is the position of trade union leadership towards Marxist and non-Marxist theory? Is there any serious effort being undertaken to develop Marxian economics further? What other important theorems should be seriously contemplated today?</li> <li>In relative separation from the above questions, there is the problem relating to the direct control of mass culture by monopoly. It would have the greatest significance for the project to have a clear notion of the mechanisms of control, economic and personal, through which each of the important spheres and the cultivation of the next generation are regulated. This is rather simple to establish in the case of film; the most important data is still to be compiled from other areas (radio, newspapers, magazines, universities, and scientific foundations). To this belongs the interconnections between individual sectors of the culture-industry. Perhaps Upton Sinclair, who studied a number of these questions at an earlier point in time, will be of use for these investigations. Furthermore, the literary-sociological side of the work, which has so far extended only to German and American biographies, ought to be expanded to other branches of popular literature and to the specific categories of such work as a whole.</li> </ol> <p>In the following, we provide several suggestions which should be pursued further in future correspondence. Further areas for literary analysis come to mind: best sellers and the publications of book clubs; movie-magazines, especially those which report on the stars and their private lives; introductions to the drugstore editions of major literary works; program booklets for philharmonic concerts and other kinds of entertainment; analysis of advertisements.</p> <p>Categories in connection with the big work:</p> <ul> <li>“Unmasking” but not attack</li> <li>Reduction of quality to quantity, malice towards different qualities</li> <li>Accept blows without rancor to eventually be included in racket</li> <li>Apology for the accidentality and irrationality of career (no development)</li> <li>Indifference to the area in which one finds success</li> <li>Glorification of determinate practical qualities, especially in the extra-practical domain (e.g. dexterity, quick-wittedness, aggressivity, technical specialist knowledge and tricks, “performance,” endurance, pseudo-radicalism)</li> <li>Antinomies: the hero must be individual and average at the same time.</li> <li>Conscious subordination of law [<em>Recht</em>] to the collectivity</li> <li>Success as justification.</li> </ul> <p>Naturally, many of these aspects are already included within the biographical work. Others which have already arisen have here been deliberately omitted. The end goal would be to develop them on the basis of a unified theoretical context—namely, the tendency towards the unification of the world.</p> <h2 id="notes-for-the-programme-of-the-book-8301942">Notes for the Programme of the Book (8/30/1942)</h2> <ul> <li>The part on the theory of immiseration [<em>Verelendungstheorie</em>] should be used to show that with the decrease in immiseration, with the integration of the workers into existing society, the class constitutes itself as the epitome of individual rackets, and accordingly cuts out everything which no longer belongs to the class in this sense.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> For the first time, this relation should be presented not as it always has been to date, by the enemies of the proletariat, but by a proletarian theory itself.</li> </ul> <p><ins> Problem:</ins></p> <ul> <li>Should there be a historical unity?

Unlike most animals, humans do not have immediate access to their own conditions of reproduction. The tools and knowledge necessary for their metabolic interchange with nature is mediated through social formations, even what constitutes human needs at any given historical period is socially mediated, unlike what modern psychology might want us to believe.<d-footnote>See Adorno’s critique of the false division of basic and non-basic needs in Theodor W Adorno, “Theses on Need,” trs.

Gunzelin Schmid Noerr (S. Fischer Verlag, 1985), 287</d-footnote> Human production (and reproduction) is mediated through tools that arise in specific social relations, the same tools in turn start to mediate the social relations, human organizations and ways of living come to be “prescribed by the nature of such tools.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> Marx conceptualizes tools as <em>organs</em> of production, as a corporeal part of the human body required for human metabolism:</p> <blockquote> <p>The first thing of which the labourer possesses himself is not the subject of labour but its instrument. Thus Nature becomes one of the organs of his activity, one that he annexes to his own bodily organs, adding stature to himself in spite of the Bible.<d-footnote>Karl Marx, *Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1*, in *Marx/Engels Collected Works* (hereafter MECW), vol. 35 (Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1996), 189</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>As Søren Mau has recently pointed out, as instruments of production (qua organs) can become the private property of individuals and groups, it “has the consequence that power can weave itself into the very fabric of the human metabolism.”<d-footnote>Søren Mau, *Mute Compulsion: A Marxist Theory of the Economic Power of Capital* (Verso, 2023), 115</d-footnote> The theoretical core of the concepts of the relations and forces of production consists in this fact, namely that human metabolism and reproduction is organized in definite social relations with the use of tools. Following Engels, Horkheimer argues that the primacy of tools in production is mirrored by the development of patriarchy apropos transition from mother-right to father-right with the concrete development of sedentary agriculture. The bygone age of matriarchy is associated with that of pre-history, an era without class conflict that did not objectify humans as tools for social reproduction;<d-footnote>Max Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family” in *Critical theory: Selected Essays*, tr. Matthew J. O’Connell et al (Continuum, 1982), 118</d-footnote> Durkheim, meanwhile, associates pre-history without the division between public and private life as mechanical solidarity, contrasted with the organic solidarity of modernity with its highly specialized division of labour that grants its members some semblance of individuality.<d-footnote>Émile Durkheim, *The Division of Labour in Society*, trans. W. D. Halls, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013).</d-footnote> In actuality, this division between private and public signified the development of class society with domination within and outside the family by different groups of people organized in a hierarchy. The development of patriarchy and class are deeply intertwined.</p> <p>Early critical theory explicitly uses the dialectic between forces and relations of production as a starting point to develop a theory of class. The ownership of the means and objects of production by different members of the species was primarily maintained by repression of direct producers. The repression was rationalized as being in the long-term interests of the whole of society because it purportedly incentivized social and economic development; this development in turn made the forces of repression obsolete and irrational.<d-footnote>Theodor W. Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory” in *Can One Live After Auschwitz? A Philosophical Reader*, ed. Rolf Tiedemann (Stanford University Press, 2003), 110</d-footnote> The subordination of individuals in a hierarchy appears as rational until the conditions of social reproduction change through the development of society (apropos the forces of production.) As emblematically articulated by Max Weber, the concept of rationality in traditional theory meant the use of reason by a transcendental calculating subject to navigate the world of values.<d-footnote>See Weber’s discussion on formal rationality in Max Weber, Economy and Society: A New Translation, trans. Keith Tribe (Harvard University Press, 2019,) 172-177; Gillian Rose on Weber’s neo-kantian inheritance in Gillian Rose, Hegel Contra Sociology, (Verso, 2009,) 22-23; Horkheimer on the Marburg school and the status of the individual in Horkheimer, “Traditional and Critical Theory,” 198-200.</d-footnote> Horkheimer appropriates the concept of rationality as itself arising from historically developing social relations that organizes the conditions of social reproduction. It is not “false” consciousness to accept the conditions of subordination but rather it is in “the [immediate] interests of those who were ruled… It was a condition for the development of mankind’s capabilities.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 70</d-footnote> At stake is how humans navigate and internalize the limits of social formations as activity rather than as mere automatons fully path-dependent on a structure.</p> <p>Hence, the intersection of the process of production and the form of exploitation is central to understanding the class structure of any given social formation.<d-footnote>See “Introduction: Themes in Historical Materialism” in Jairus Banaji, *Theory as History: Essays on Modes of Production and Exploitation*, (Haymarket, 2010).</d-footnote> The processes through which the surplus labour of direct producers is appropriated by the owners of the means of production influences the forms of thinking (and social control) in society that become embodied in relatively autonomous institutions such as the family, education, and religion—the Institut für Sozialforschung prefigures what is later conceptualized as the ideological state apparatus that stabilizes the structure of capitalism by Louis Althusser.<d-footnote>See Louis Althusser, *On the Reproduction of Capitalism: Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses*, trans. G. M. Goshgarian (London New York: Verso, 2014).</d-footnote> As Horkheimer himself puts it:</p> <blockquote> <p>“To regard the economic process as a determining ground of events means that one considers all other spheres of social life in their changing relationships to it and that one conceives this process itself not in its isolated mechanical form but in connection with the specific capabilities and dispositions of men, which have, of course, been developed by the economic process itself.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 52</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>On the flipside, Horkheimer interrogates the processes of internalization and rationalization of authority by direct producers (and the excluded), which is characteristically reflected in the culture of a society. The “so-called social nature” of humanity that appears natural to positivist psychologists as the “self-integration into a given order of things”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 56</d-footnote> through institutions such as religion is reducible to “the memory of the acts of force by which men were made ‘sociable’ and civilized and which threaten them still if they become too forgetful.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 52</d-footnote> The history of direct domination and its social memory is reflected in the tendency to accept conditions of indirect domination—the history of the caste system and its continuing prevalence today in both direct and indirect forms serves as the paradigmatic example. The liberal hope that the caste system would be eventually supplanted by the development of capitalism was never realized, caste domination was instead integrated with capitalist social relations.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 62-65.</d-footnote></p> <h2 id="class-contract-and-monopoly">Class, Contract and Monopoly</h2> <p>Marx extensively wrote about class and class struggle throughout his life but never developed a systematic theory of class per se. Infamously, the manuscript for the third volume of C<em>apital</em> ends just as Marx begins a section on class. Furthermore, Michael Heinrich argues that the concept of class in the three volumes of <em>Capital</em> appears as the (unwritten) result of the unfolding categories of political economy rather than a precondition/assumption for a systematic theory of capitalism.<d-footnote>Michael Heinrich, *An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Karl Marx’s Capital*, tr. Alexander Locasio (Monthly Review Press, 2012), 192</d-footnote> Marx describes his method as “rising from the abstract to the concrete,”<d-footnote>Karl Marx, “Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58” in Karl Marx: 1857-61, Collected Works 28 (Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1986), 38 See section 3 of the Introduction in the volume for more on Marx’s method, 37–45..</d-footnote> developing the most abstract concepts of classical political economy that are layered on top of each other to describe complex tendencies that exist within capitalism as a historically emergent system. Marx starts with describing the dynamics of commodities as products of labour, from which he derives most other mutually interlocking concepts and categories of “exchange value and use value, exchange value and value, concrete and abstract labour, as well as the necessity of money and its functions, the concept of capital, the theory of surplus value and exploitation, the class relation underlying all of this, and so on.”<d-footnote>Mau, *Mute Compulsion*, 13</d-footnote> Thus, the concept of class in the capitalist mode of production is dependent on all these other interlocking concepts. This is quite different from modern sociological theories that abstractly conceptualize class in terms of social stratification based on occupation and their income brackets (i.e. lower, middle, and upper classes). Following Marx, Horkheimer conceptualizes class as a concrete historical category that cannot be understood in isolation/abstraction from the actual processes of social reproduction in a given social formation. Class is simultaneously understood at a structural level as the social position of a group within a specific social formation and as a group cognizant of itself as a class apropos its social location. Class as a political agent, or an interest group only exists if individuals that share common interests are conscious of their own social position.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> In “Reflections on Class Theory,” Adorno points out that “the concept of class is bound up with the emergence of the proletariat.”<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 93</d-footnote> Class only becomes intelligible with the universal domination over the proletariat through necessitating conditions that require an individual to sell her labour-power for wages, a situation which is the result of the ongoing process of primitive accumulation.<d-footnote>Most readings of Marx on primitive accumulation understand it as something restricted to the past. For Marx, however, primitive accumulation is a necessary component of capitalism as a system. Capitalism functions through the continual appropriation of resources that create conditions of wage labour. See William Clare Roberts, “What Was Primitive Accumulation? Reconstructing the Origin of a Critical Concept,” *European Journal of Political Theory* 19, no. 4 (October 2020): 532–52, [https://doi.org/10.1177/1474885117735961](https://doi.org/10.1177/1474885117735961)</d-footnote> The declaration that “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles”<d-footnote>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, “Manifesto of the Communist Party” in MECW*,* Vol. 6 (Lawrence and Wishart, 1976) 484</d-footnote> in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> implied that what was previously thought of as natural hierarchies of the primitive tribe or the divine right of kings were nothing but stronger groups dominating the weaker ones to control production and thereby exist outside the immediate process of production qua labour, i.e. to be served by majority of the population.<d-footnote>As Horkheimer puts it, “to assume authority over large areas in order to be nourished and housed and served by as large a population as possible. The same holds good for the ruling groups of Greek antiquity, as represented by the city-states and factions.” Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The past is understood retroactively through the present—or inversely, as Adorno puts it, the history of domination and oppression culminates in the universal domination of capitalism.<d-footnote>“If all the oppression that man has ever inflicted on man culminates in the modern age in the cold inhumanity of free wage labor, then the past is revealed in conditions and things – the romantic contrast to industrial reason – as the trace of former suffering. The archaic silence of pyramids and ruins becomes conscious of itself in materialist thought: it is the echo of factory noise in the landscape of the immutable.” Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 94</d-footnote> Hence, for Marx (and the critical theorists), class struggle implied the fight against the system of capitalism and the very concept of classes as such.</p> <p>The capitalist process of production is based on the “so-called labour contract,”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, Authority and the Family, 86</d-footnote> where the worker could sell her labour-power for a wage through which she could access the conditions of her continual reproduction. The contract guaranteed by the state and law, which were (purportedly) and to varying degrees held up by democratic institutions that represented the will of the people within the nation-state. However, this free contract concealed the actual inequality between people, where an individual worker was more “dependent on the settlement of a contract” than the owners of Capital, who could choose between workers.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> This meant that the working class had to adapt to existing unequal conditions by competition (contra struggle) amongst themselves as each individual worker had to compete against others to sell her labour, which meant that wages rarely rose above subsistence levels, and even below subsistence observed throughout the history of capitalism. Hence, “The distinction between employer and worker lay in the fact that this impersonal necessity […] represented for the employer the condition for his control and for the worker a pitiless fate.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> The subordination of the individual to irrational economic circumstances through the contract is also personal submission to the will of an employer.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>The Soviet jurist Evgeny Pashukanis locates the birth of legality and the institution of law with the development and universalization of capitalist social relations. In capitalism, the relationship of exploitation is legally mediated through the form of the contract as the worker disposes of her labour power as a commodity on the market, in contrast with direct forms of subjugation seen in societies based on slavery and serfdom. Social regulation, sanctions, and disciplinary mechanisms are rendered through the legal form rather than direct unalienated punishment.<d-footnote>Michel Foucault shows the transition between direct punishment to indirect punishment through the legal apparatus. Michel Foucault, *Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison,* tr. Alan Sheridan (Vintage Books, 1995)</d-footnote> Hence Pashukanis argues that it is only in capitalism that “the legal form attains universal significance, legal ideology becomes the ideology par excellence, and defending the class interest of the exploiters appears with ever increasing success as the defense of the abstract principle of legal subjectivity.”<d-footnote>Evgeny Bronislavovich Pashukanis, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism*, tr. Barbara Einhorn, ed. Chris Arthur (Transaction, 2002), 45</d-footnote> The primary function of the legal form is the concealment of the actuality of exploitation in the process of production, which is accompanied by the reduction of individuals (who embody differences) to a formal equality as subjects of the law. The legal form becomes the essential “precondition for the non-coercive extraction of surplus value, on which the reproduction of the capitalist relations of production rest.”<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote> For Horkheimer, the ban on collective bargaining and the state control over contracts in fascism “revealed what was already inherent in liberalism.” Hence, “it would be a grave theoretical mistake to denounce the contract in modern totalitarianism as a mere formality, and stress its genuine authenticity under liberalism.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The very impersonal nature of the labour contract incentivizes reactionary responses by hiding the actual relations of exploitation between people, which in conditions of social crisis leads to minority groups being held as a scapegoat.<d-footnote>See Moishe Postone, “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism: Notes on the German Reaction to "Holocaust",” *New German Critique*, no. 19 (1980): 97–115, [https://doi.org/10.2307/487974](https://doi.org/10.2307/487974).</d-footnote></p> <p>The development of capitalism is highlighted by intra-class struggle within the ruling class as the logic of monopolization/expansion comes in conflict with each other, alongside the primary struggle between producers and owners of the means of production. The ruling class, “has always been characterized by its internal struggles, by the efforts of one of its parts to secure the spoils that others might appropriate. The struggle for security among the elite has been a race for the most far-reaching command possible, in other words, for control of production.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> The development of nation-states lead to the struggle over industries central to social reproduction of economic life, which in turn lead to the dominance of a small number of elite families over these industries. The tendency towards monopolization closely knit with the intra-class conflict within the bourgeoisie is mutually determined by the inner tendencies of capital accumulation and pre-capitalist social forms such as caste. What the economists understood as externalities that hampered intended functioning of the market were rather immanent to the very functioning of the logic of capitalist accumulation; it is in the direct interests of the ruling class to reduce and hamper competition amongst themselves through subordinating one another while incentivizing competition in the working class to reduce wages.<d-footnote>Ibid.</d-footnote></p> <p>The discrepancy between the legal discourse<d-footnote>As Pashukanis argues, “The constitutional state is a mirage, but one which suits the bourgeoisie very well \[…\] Power as the 'collective will', as the 'rule of law'. is realised in bourgeois society to the extent that this society represents a market.” [Pashukanis, *The General Theory of Law and Marxism*, 147](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?uVZXCo).</d-footnote> of the abstract individual who can freely interact with the market and the actuality of unfreedom is highlighted by this tendency of monopolization immanent to class society. The assertion that <em>real</em> utopian ideals of liberalism qua capitalism is corrupted by what are <em>purportedly</em> external forces of the state and bureaucracy becomes the ideological rationalization of the struggle within the ruling class. Labels such as cronyism are attributed to those who gain an advantageous monopoly position through political and ideological connections with the existing state. The utopian ideal of liberalism naturalizes capitalist social relations as a fundamental part of human existence while simultaneously denying the immanent tendencies of capitalism. This highlights the actual non-identity of the concept of class; it designates the real unity of (bourgeois) interests of a class that is accompanied by its actual dis-unity.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 98</d-footnote> These discrepancies are accentuated during monopolization as the entirety of society is pitted against itself to gain control over resources necessary for social reproduction, members of a social strata attempt to better their social position while suppressing the members of strata below them—social mobility is intimately interwoven with the subordination of others within the constraints of class society.</p> <p>The development of organizational forms with a rigid hierarchy, which Horkheimer calls totalities, is not merely a result of the optimization mechanisms of the capitalist market that maximizes allocative efficiency of resources,<d-footnote>See R. H. Coase, “The Nature of the Firm,” *Economica* 4, no. 16 (November 1937): 386–405, [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x)</d-footnote> but rather contains within itself the history of struggle for the control over resources. The power relations that have developed over time and the optimization mechanisms of the market mutually determine each other. The concept of allocative efficiency is reframed as the most effective method of monopolizing resources that are not fully integrated into capitalist relations of production through what Marx called the original/primitive accumulation. While monopolies have always existed throughout the development of capitalism, the monopoly stage of capitalism only arises with the near-full integration of capital in social life and state vis-a-vis control over production by a small minority.</p> <p>For Paul A. Baran and Paul Sweezy, monopolies are big corporations that are highly efficient rational calculators for extracting social surplus. They are “profit maximizers and capital accumulators,” and “they are managed by company men whose fortunes are identified with the corporations’ success or failure.”<d-footnote>Paul A. Baran and Paul M. Sweezy, *Monopoly Capital: An Essay on the American Economic and Social Order*, (Monthly Review Press, 1968).</d-footnote> These monopolies start organizing normal economic life with aid from the state as they control the price system, tax and labour policy to maximize production and profitability of the corporation. Production is centralized in a small number of production units that are hierarchically organized for the efficient transfer of information and social control over the workers.<d-footnote>Otto Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” in *The Journal of Politics*, May, 1944, Vol. 6, No. 2, 139-176 [https://doi.org/10.2307/2125270](https://doi.org/10.2307/2125270); 148</d-footnote> This is accompanied by change in the production process (what Marx called real subsumption<d-footnote>In the economic manuscripts of 1861-63, Marx writes about the real subsumption of capitalism as changing the very nature of work to suit the needs of capital accumulation as opposed to formal subsumption, where surplus is extracted from pre-capitalist ways of production. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, MECW, Vol. 34 (Lawrence and Wishart, 1994) 104–17.</d-footnote>): the scientific management of Taylor and the moving conveyor belts that fed the highly specialized division of labour of Ford.<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty,” 145</d-footnote> Otto Kirchheimer in “Quest for Sovereignty” demonstrates that highly organized <em>hierarchical</em> monopolies efficiently “[respond] quite often to the needs of government” as self interested bourgeoise nation-states under specific conditions such as war, “leads to a wholesome transfer of public authority to the principal agencies of private self-administration.”<d-footnote>Kirchheimer, op. cit., 150</d-footnote> With hindsight, we can observe that the process of privatization has taken place regardless of any extraneous conditions. Hence, Adorno points out that with monopolization</p> <blockquote> <p>The ruling class disappears behind the concentration of capital. This latter has reached a magnitude and acquired a weight of its own that enables capital to present itself as an institution, as the expression of society as a whole. By virtue of its omnipotence, the particular is able to usurp the totality: this overall social aspect of capital is the endpoint of the old fetish character of the commodity according to which relations between men are reflected back to them as relations between things.<d-footnote>Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory,” 99</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>In the mid-20th century, monopoly capitalism could absorb the majority of the population into the production process—at least in the first world. This fundamentally changed with the further development of capitalism into neo-liberal capitalism with the regulation and creation of new markets in spheres that were previously managed by the state such as education.<d-footnote>David Harvey, *A Brief History of Neoliberalism* (Oxford University Press, 2005), 65</d-footnote> The result was a massive tide of exclusion from the production process, and therefore the expansion of what Marx called the relative surplus population.<d-footnote>“The labouring population therefore produces, along with the accumulation of capital produced by it, the means by which it itself is made relatively superfluous, is turned into a relative surplus population; and it does this to an always increasing extent.” Marx, *Capital*, 623</d-footnote> The expansion of the surplus population was simultaneously accompanied by the total integration of all aspects of life into the market.</p> <p>What, then, is the nature of class and class struggle with this furthering integration of capitalism into every facet of life? Horkheimer points out that during the revolutionary movements of the 19th and early 20th century, capitalism did not fully hold sway over every aspect of life—there were spaces with relative autonomy for individual entrepreneurs, subsistence producers, etc. As the impersonal market forces of capitalism began to dominate almost everyone with extending monopolization (and later on the advent of neoliberalism), class struggle fundamentally changes its form while the antagonisms of capitalism are heightened through, for example, the rapid expansion of the informal sector and imperialist super exploitation of the global south. As Horkheimer puts it,</p> <blockquote> <p>The development of capitalistic society according to its own inherent tendencies caused the progressive traits of competition to disappear. It severed the link between the needs of consumers and the profit-interest of the individual entrepreneur; it diminished the possibility, slight as it was, of an independent mind gaining access to an independent position; it reduced the number of relatively autonomous economic subjects, who by the very fact of that plurality had an interest in the functioning of general law and in its impartial administration. All this vanishes in the later stages of capitalism and allows society to revert to more direct forms of domination, which in fact never had been quite suspended.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote></p> </blockquote> <p>For the early critical theorists, the rapid immiseration of the working class during moments of crisis undermined the institutions that rationalized conditions of subordination. Which raises the possibility of revolutionary aspirations in the working class to change the very conditions of social reproduction, hence the “resolute will of progressive groups to win the victory over the naked force of arms”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “Authority and the Family,” 60</d-footnote> of the ruling classes. However, Horkheimer points out that it is equally possible for reactionary forces to co-opt the anxieties caused by crisis to reinstate “outmoded cultural apparatuses” with intensified disciplinary power.<d-footnote>Horkheimer, op. cit., 60</d-footnote> With the universalization of the impersonal mechanisms of capitalism (the interlocking forms of market, law and the state), capitalism provides movements for radical progress and regression into explicit forms of social domination. For Horkheimer (and the rest of the institution), the monopoly stage of Capitalism was already a regress into barbarism. Class struggle had largely been replaced by <em>class adaptation</em> as a result of the development of highly integrated monopoly society, the working class’s relationship to “the different capitalistic groups [is] no longer radically different from those prevailing among the capitalistic groups themselves.”<d-footnote>Horkheimer, “On The Sociology of Class Relations.”</d-footnote> This does not imply that the possibility of radical change disappears, but rather shows the forms of consciousness that develop in monopoly capitalism.</p>]]></content><author><name>Re Tejus</name></author><category term="Racketology"/><category term="report"/><category term="write-up"/><category term="study"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part 1 on the Frankfurt School's racket concept]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">From Racket Theory to Real Domination</title><link href="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_Camatte/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="From Racket Theory to Real Domination"/><published>2025-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_Camatte</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ctwgwebsite.github.io/blog/2025/Rackets_Camatte/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>In the early 1940s, the Frankfurt School developed a body of work—most of it only published posthumously decades later—that has been given the name ‘racket theory.’ That body of work is the topic of Section 2 of this essay.</p> <p>The other subject of this essay is the French (post-) Marxist theorist Jacques Camatte. In what follows I will be mostly concerned with works dating to before Camatte’s turn towards holocaust denial,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> homophobia,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> transphobia,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> anti-abortion politics, and the <em>nouvelle droite</em>. With regard to the thematic material, I will be focused on drawing out the aspects of Camatte’s work that resonate with the Frankfurt School’s racket theory.</p> <p>While my verdict on Camatte is fundamentally unfavorable, I have tried my best to keep the text from degenerating into an ultra-left version of the classic “my dad can beat up your dad” argument. Also, I started writing this before Camatte died; it is not a theoretical obituary. Special thanks to James Crane for translating most of the quotations from Horkheimer.</p> <h2 id="the-frankfurt-schools-racket-theory">The Frankfurt School’s Racket Theory</h2> <p>Let’s begin our crash course in racketology with a long quotation from Otto Kirchheimer:</p> <blockquote> <p>The term racket is a polemical one. It reflects on a society in which social position has increasingly come to depend on a relation of participation, on the primordial effect of whether an individual succeeded or failed to “arrive”. Racket connotes a society in which individuals have lost the belief that compensation for their individual efforts will result from the mere functioning of impersonal market agencies. But it keeps in equal distance from, and does not incorporate, the idea of a society wherein the antagonism between men and inanimate elements of production has been dissolved in the image of a free association for the common use of productive forces. It is the experience of an associational practice which implies that neither the individual’s choice of an association nor the aims that the latter pursues are the result of conscious acts belonging to the realm of human freedom.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>This gives us much of what is fundamental in the Frankfurt School’s critical appropriation of the concept of the racket, but it is too matter-of-fact, too much of a finished product. To get at the origin of their racket theory, we have to turn to an essay by Adorno entitled “Reflections on Class Theory.”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Relevant for my purposes are the following three sentences, which form a dialectical series:</p> <ol> <li>“All history is the history of class struggles because it was always the same thing, namely, prehistory.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></li> <li>“In the image of the latest economic phase, history is the history of monopolies.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></li> <li>“In the image of the manifest act of usurpation that is practiced nowadays by the leaders of capital and labor acting in consort, it is the history of gang wars and rackets.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></li> </ol> <p>I do not have the space for an extended reading of Adorno’s “Reflections,” so I am just going to translate the essential theses above into the problematic we discover in the broader racket theory corpus:</p> <p>A. The equation history = class struggles = prehistory poses a challenge on the terrain of theory: to find unity in history with reference to future freedom (communism-as-society) by and while positing class struggle as its motor (communism-as-the-real-movement).<br/> B. The ascendance of monopolies that abrogate the principle of economic competition requires a rethinking of the concept of class because “the concept of class […] is modeled on the bourgeoisie itself. As the anonymous unity of the owners of the means of production and their various appendages, the bourgeoisie is the class par excellence.”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Now “the ruling class disappears behind the concentration of capital;”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> it consists of monopolists and monolith social capital. Problem (A) is further complicated. History is the history of monopolies. (Thus, pseudo-marxisms: Veblen, progressivism, social democracy, theoretical Popular Frontism, etc.)<br/> C. Finally, the homological hierarchies of domination present in organized labor and monopoly capital throw the destiny of the proletariat into question. The return of direct domination is complemented by a tendency towards ‘voluntary’ conformism. Freedom becomes a dirty word.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p> <p>The theory of rackets, imagined in this way as a fragmentary response to Adorno’s inaugural essay, is an answer to the question of how theory can maintain the core of historical materialism (A) while undergoing a fundamental rethinking of the concept of class (B) and class struggle (C).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> I lack the space to explain it below, but Camatte’s problematic is similar. Now for racket theory proper.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p> <p>In the fragment “Die Rackets und der Geist,” Horkheimer writes that the racket is the “basic form of domination.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> This is because class society is itself a racket: “‘Ruling class’ always means the structure of rackets on the basis of a determinate mode of production, so far as they simultaneously protect and suppress the lowest strata.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Or again: “The structure [of every ruling class in history] has been that of competing rackets.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p> <p>The use of the term racket was inspired by what the members of the Frankfurt School (and many others) saw as the increasing monopolization of the capitalist economy, a process that entailed corresponding changes in politics and culture. The tendency within capitalism towards concentration and centralization “allows society to revert to more direct forms of domination, which in fact never had been quite suspended.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p> <p>But the ruling class is not the only racket. Racket-style organization, according to Horkheimer, now also predominates in the labor movement. This is part of a wider historical tendency: “Under the pressure of the ruling class, people within the ruled class are forced to become rulers against those who are even more powerless. The oppressed themselves still become, through this mediation, the direct executioner of those further down.”<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> Part of a wider historical tendency, but not identical with it! Horkheimer is clear, albeit pessimistically so, about the specific historical potential of the proletariat in the fragment “Geschichte der amerikanischen Arbeiterschaft” :</p> <blockquote> <p>The historical course of the proletariat led to a crossroads: it could become a class or a racket. Becoming a ‘racket’ would have meant privileges within national borders, becoming a ‘class’ would have meant world revolution. Leaders have robbed the proletariat of this decision.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The resignation of the proletariat’s historic task by the official labor movement, which for Horkheimer was emblemized by the American Federation of Labor and the German Social Democrats, meant that a strong distinction had to be made between radical and reformist (actually conformist) forms of class struggle.</p> <p>In the foregoing passages, Horkheimer is referring to a particular meaning of racket, namely the protection racket. This interpretation agrees with Horkheimer’s earlier claim in “The End of Reason” that “Protection is the archetype of domination.”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> The unity of protection and domination is one of two essential unifying characteristics of the various social forms to which Horkheimer gives the name racket. Thus: “The most general category of functions practiced by groups is protection. Groups maintain the conditions for the continuation of the division of labor in which they have favored standing; they uphold and violently ward off changes that could endanger their monopoly. They are rackets.”<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p> <p>The other essential characteristic of the racket is its particularism: “Every racket conspires against spirit, and all conspire against, among one another. The reconciliation of universal and particular is immanent to spirit; the racket is their irreconcilable opposition, disguised by ideas of unity and community.”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Competitiveness and hostility grow out of this fundamental particularism.</p> <p>This leaves us with the question of what exactly the purpose of the racket is as a form of social organization. Kirchheimer provides a rather direct answer: for him, the aim of all so-called racketeers is the “establishment of domination over a segment of the process of production or distribution.”<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Horkheimer sometimes provides similarly broad qualifications (“to get as large a share of power over men, goods and services as possible”), but in other places he places a distinct emphasis on the sphere of distribution or circulation. For instance:</p> <blockquote> <p>The concept of racket therefore refers to the big as well as to the small units; they all struggle for as great a share as possible of the surplus value. […] Emphasis is to be laid on the fact that the role of a group in production though determining to a great extent its share of consumption, has been in class society a good strategic position for grasping as much goods and services as possible in the sphere of distribution.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The emphasis on distribution in passages like the one above suggests a close connection to Friedrich Pollock’s theory of state capitalism,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> and indeed most commentators have interpreted Horkheimer in this way. Such interpretations ignore Horkheimer’s strong criticism of Pollock’s theory in the fragment “Die Ideologie der Politik Heute.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Adorno was perhaps even more repulsed by Pollock’s theory of state capitalism, writing to Horkheimer that “a critique [of Pollock’s essay “State Capitalism”] that would express my view of the matter would have been psychologically beyond my control” and going on to request that Horkheimer completely rewrite it.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> In my opinion, the analyses of Franz Neumann’s <em>Behemoth</em> bear greater resemblance to (Adorno and) Horkheimer’s theory than do those of Pollock’s essays on state capitalism.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p> <p>In any case, the racket theory had a broader scope than the theory of state capitalism. Older forms of social organization were also castigated: the family is a racket, gender is a racket, and so are the initiatory communities of so-called “primitive tribes.” Thus, Horkheimer applied the concept in a transhistorical manner, but he had his reasons for doing so. As far as he was concerned, the concept was only thinkable in the first place with reference to modern rackets: “The modern concept [of the racket] serves to describe past social relations. ‘The anatomy of the man is the key to the anatomy of the monkey.’”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> The racket-style organization is only boiled down to its essence in the modern racket.</p> <p>Horkheimer’s condemnation of rackets is wide-ranging, but it is not an attack on organization <em>as such</em> or even all organizations contemporaneous to his work. A handful of fragments and texts from the 1940s provide us with indications of what Horkheimer thought a revolutionary organization would look like. For starters, a non-racket organization in class society can only be a fighting organization “with its point directed upwards,” but such organizations “have no place in the established hierarchy, are without regular economic function, and, after periods of illegality, live on in revolutionary actions.”<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> Horkheimer had previously condemned the tendency of reformist opposition to become integrated into capitalism in “Authoritarian State,” writing that “Whatever seeks to extend itself under domination runs the danger of reproducing it.”<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p> <p>More concretely, Horkheimer was a proponent of workers’ council democracy.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> In the racket theory corpus, he and Adorno repeatedly assert that workers are capable of taking over and competently managing the present system of production.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> He closely read the articles on the Spanish Civil War that Karl Korsch sent him, and scattered positive references to the anarchists of Spain may indicate sympathy for Korsch’s argument that they were the successors of the revolutionary spirit of 1917.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p> <h2 id="camattes-theory-of-the-real-domination-of-capital">Camatte’s Theory of the Real Domination of Capital</h2> <p>Now I turn to summary and analysis of the relevant parts of Jacques Camatte’s oeuvre. I am concerned in particular with Series II of <em>Invariance</em> (i.e., the years 1971-1975), which is dominated in content by Camatte’s ambiguous rejection of most of Marxism (or “the theory of the proletariat” as he calls it).<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p> <p>Camatte’s eccentric reading of texts such as the <em>Grundrisse</em> and “Results of the Immediate Process of Production” lead him to create two new and interrelated concepts to describe the present form of capitalism.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> The first is the <em>real domination of capital</em>, a ‘creative’ gloss on Marx’s abortive theory of the <em>real subsumption of labor under capital</em>. The real domination of capital refers to the domination of <em>the whole of society</em> by capital and the relegation of human existence to a mere moment in the valorization process. According to Camatte, this real domination grows out of the predominance of fixed capital and relative surplus value in the production process of capital—factors which increasingly render the proletariat secondary (if not irrelevant) to the production process.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> Domination of the proletariat in the production process by means of fixed capital is then extended to mastery of the entire valorization process including circulation and eventually the real domination of society as a whole. The second concept—the material community of capital—is closely related, but distinct. The material community of capital is what supplanted the human communities (<em>Gemeinwesen</em>) of pre-capitalist modes of production. Camatte once wrote a letter to his comrade Gianni Collu explaining the concept of <em>Gemeinwesen</em> or community; he wrote that it is “the substance of the social reality of humans” and “a superior unity above all the state-unities, above the unending mob of organizations;” individuals are mere accidents of this substance.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> The establishment of capital’s real domination went hand-in-hand with its constitution as the material community of humanity. The alienated human community (capitalism) is mediated and reproduced by the socio-material processes of capital, i.e. the production and exchange of commodities within the valorization process of capital. With the advent of capital’s real domination of humanity, the material community becomes autonomous and self-reproducing, as capital is now the ground for all social institutions (e.g., the state, etc.). Capital posits its own presuppositions and becomes the presupposition of humanity. What was previously mystification now becomes real and effective. Capital dispenses with gold and value and becomes its own tautologous representation.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p> <p>Capital has thus succeeded in “[absorbing] the movement that negates it, the proletariat,” and, consequently, “all forms of working-class political organization have disappeared.”<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> At the same time, capitalists are absorbed into the automatic functioning of capital. Class conflict therefore goes the way of the dodo and is replaced by inconsequential squabbles between the gangs/rackets/organizations/groups “which are the varied modes of being of capital.”<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> Camatte explains further: “This mode of being [the gang-racket] arises from the fact that capital can only valorize itself, and hence only exist and develop its being, if a particle of itself, now autonomized, confronts the whole of society, positing itself in relation to the total-socialized equivalent, capital. [Capital] needs this confrontation (competition, emulation) because it only exists through differentiation.”<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> It is unclear if Camatte came to the word ‘racket’ by himself or if he learned it from the Frankfurt School. The former case is very plausible, as most of the texts from the Frankfurt School that presaged Camatte’s new theoretical path vis-a-vis “rackets” would not be published for several years.</p> <p>The eclipse of the proletariat by capital had consequences for practice and organization. Camatte and Collu give two points of departure for future practice: “refuse to reconstitute a group, even an informal one” and “maintain a network of personal contacts with people having realized (or in the process of doing so) the highest degree of theoretical knowledge: antifollowerism, antipedagogy; the party in its historical sense is not a school.”<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> Camatte further spelled out the practical implications of “On Organization” in a 1970 letter to his comrades:</p> <blockquote> <p>…we could be a certain number of revolutionaries without forming a group, even informally (that is to say, non-structured), but evidently this is only possible tendentially, in the sense that it is only through theoretical activity that we can avoid the traps laid for us by capitalist society. In other words, we cannot be a group and still play a part in the unification of the class that must develop presently; this can only happen if we consider ourselves as the heart of the movement [!?]; if we do not become autonomous [s’autonomise]; if, therefore, we see ourselves as an element of the becoming-unification, not as an instrument, a means to bring it about. This is why there is no interior and exterior.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>This effectively put Camatte on a level with (or even below) the <em>attentistes</em> of the French councilist group Informations et Correspondances Ouvrières (ICO),<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> although the emphasis on theoretical activity—and the belief that this groupuscular theoretical activity is of world-historical importance—gives his take a distinctively Bordigist flair.</p> <p>Texts following “On Organization” have a somewhat softer position; Camatte even had some backhanded compliments for the French Maoist movement!<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> The change in tone was connected to his latest prophetic vision: “Since [May ‘68] there has begun inside the universal class […] a struggle which will lead to the revolutionization of this class and its constitution as a party-community, the first moment of its negation.”<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> The party (-community) of which Camatte speaks is the <em>historical party</em>, i.e. communism qua ‘the real movement.’ The editor-in-chief of <em>Invariance</em> saw the new organizations of the 1960s as momentary, fragmented expressions of the movement—already underway!—that would negate ‘the proletariat’ and unify the new ‘universal class’ (which includes the “middle classes”) en route to the “immediate triumph of communism.”<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p> <p>Once we get into <em>Invariance</em>’s third series, it becomes clear that after about 1973 Camatte broke with any and all remotely conventional ideas of revolution. “Resistance,” he writes, “is a disguised [form of] waiting, an unspoken hope that the world’s course may still change.”<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> Instead of resisting, we must “leave the world,” create “communist forms” and “new modes of action,” embrace non-violence, etc. “Men and women will come to realize that they themselves are the determining elements, and that they do not have to abdicate their power to the machine…”<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> Camatte’s thinking has reached complete tautology. There is no longer anything in it worth discussing.</p> <h2 id="remarks-in-place-of-a-conclusion">Remarks (In Place of a Conclusion)</h2> <p>The similarities between Horkheimer and Adorno’s theory and that of Camatte are striking. Furthermore, direct inspiration from the Frankfurt School is (probably) not the decisive factor in Camatte’s intellectual development—although surely there was some degree of it, especially in the 1970s. I consider both the Frankfurt School’s racket theory and Camatte’s work to be failed theoretical programs, albeit ones with rational kernels. However, I also think that the Frankfurt School’s failure is more compelling, interesting, and important.</p> <p>A key difference between the Frankfurt School and Camatte lies in their conceptions of reconciliation, utopia, and revolution. Camatte is harmonistic, whereas the Frankfurt School is therapeutic.</p> <p>Camatte’s elliptical descriptions of communism betray this harmonistic tendency. His basic stance is defined by the thesis that communism “is not a question of having or of doing, but of being.”<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> It “is not a new mode of production; it is the affirmation of a new community.”<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> These abstract-metaphysical theses contrast with the Frankfurt School’s indications of what communism would look like, which are generally negative.</p> <p>The harmonism is also present in his descriptions of revolution and transition. In the texts of <em>Invariance</em> Series I, the transition simply appears as a series of policies (all taken from Bordiga) easily enacted by the omnipotent class-party-state-community: abolition of the separation between economic enterprises, shortening of the working day, cessation of all commodity exchange, disalienation of labor, etc. To that extent, and only to that extent, the early Camatte is guilty of “[degrading] the revolution to mere progress.”<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> Subsequent treatments of the topic in Series II of <em>Invariance</em> degenerate into the fairytale prophecies summarized above. In Camatte’s mature work, the mechanical predictions of vulgar historical materialism—predictions which at least had the pretension of being scientific—are replaced by a willfully abstract belief in humanity. Despite the continuous and drastic changes in his theory, one never finds any trace of genuine autocritique in Camatte, only the mind-numbingly repetitious discourse of a pseudosagelike know-it-all. The puppet called “Gemeinwesen” is always supposed to win.</p> <p>The works of the Frankfurt School, by contrast, are suffused with the awareness that what has been lost can never be regained, not really.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> Even the dead are not safe from the enemy, and we have scarcely any idea what victory would look like. Thus Benjamin:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whoever wishes to know what the situation of a ‘redeemed humanity’ might actually be, what conditions are required for the development of such a situation, and when this development can be expected to occur, poses questions to which there are no answers. He might just as well seek to know the color of ultraviolet rays.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Benjamin’s polemical denial that we can have any idea of what redemption looks like is complemented by Adorno’s negative utopianism. The utopian can and does appear to us, but only fleetingly through reflection. Adorno’s descriptions of the good life are gnomically simple: it is “life without fear” or “a world in which no one goes hungry.” In Horkheimer’s early work, on the other hand, we find a certain cynicism and an awareness of the tragic element in everything. Revolution is nothing metaphysical; it is simply a matter of pain, hunger, and misery, of sufferings that can never be repaid. Socialism is not the perfection of humanity.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> Nor is either revolution or socialism a sure thing: “the experience of our generation,” Benjamin wrote, was that “capitalism will not die a natural death.”<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup></p> <p>Adorno and Horkheimer’s reflective meditations have a greater edificatory—and indeed truly <em>mystical</em>—effect than Camatte’s attempts at intuitive illumination, to say nothing of Benjamin’s Marxist mysticism.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> Camatte’s trajectory as a thinker is something like Benjamin’s intellectual life being played backwards. Instead of moving from mysticism to Marxism, it is his later works which are characterized by sophomoric metaphysics and infatuation with reactionary mystics (Klages, Bachofen, etc.).</p> <p>The most compelling part of Camatte’s work—the concept of the material community of capital—predates his turn away from Marxism. Again there is a striking resemblance to the Frankfurt School—here I refer to Adorno’s analysis of (capitalist) society as a reified totality.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> One of the key differences relates to <em>analysis</em> in its original sense: breaking things down. Camatte explicitly refused the possibility of this, claiming that capital has overridden its logical elements and presupposed categories (the commodity, value, money, labor, etc.). Conversely, Adorno tended to center the basic exchange relation, and hence the aforementioned elementary categories. (I think many people who take influence from Camatte actually interpret the material community concept with reference to the elementary concepts, hence in a Lukácsian-Adornian manner.) Camatte began with the real subsumption of labor within the immediate process of production and then extrapolated this into the real domination of humanity by capital, whereas Adorno, being more sociologically cautious, focused on the expansion of commodity fetishism to cover greater and greater parts of social life. In my opinion, the Lukács-Adorno approach has infinitely more analytical potency than Camatte’s deliberately flattened social ontology.</p> <p>As I said before, I believe that both theories are ultimately failures. The difference lies in what they offer as salvage for thinking, in the potential for a critical re-appropriation of their analysis. The Frankfurt School’s incomplete conversations about rackets offer more for this purpose than Camatte’s impenetrable monologue on real domination.<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Jacques Camatte, <a href="https://www.ilcovile.it/xenia/revueinvariance/evanescence.html">“Évanescence du mythe antifasciste”</a> (1982) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>Jacques Camatte, <a href="https://www.ilcovile.it/xenia/revueinvariance/amourcombinatoire.html">“Amour ou combinatoire sexuelle”</a> (1978) <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>Jacques Camatte, <a href="https://libcom.org/article/interview-jacques-camatte-2019">“Interview with Cercle Marx”</a> (2019) <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>Otto Kirchheimer, “In Quest of Sovereignty” in <em>The Journal of Politics</em>, May, 1944, Vol. 6, No. 2, 139-176; 161. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:5"> <p>Theodor Adorno, “Reflections on Class Theory” (1942) in <em>Can One Live After Auschwitz?

Feel free to submit works dealing with Critical Theory, Marxism, socialism, and/or communism, broadly construed. Please mind the following guidelines when submitting:</p> <p><em>Formal requirements</em> :</p> <ul> <li>Original submissions should be a single finished text (not a pitch) with a maximum length of around 3000 words (not counting bibliography).</li> <li>Submissions need not be traditional essays; we accept aphorisms, ‘theses,’ dialogues, and similar non-traditional genres of theoretical writing.</li> <li>Submissions should be accompanied by a short summary or abstract of a few sentences (ca. 200 words).</li> <li>US-American spelling and grammar is preferred, but not required.</li> <li>Submissions should use the Chicago Manual of Style with endnotes (bibliography optional)</li> <li>Author/translator bios are optional. Pen names are allowed.</li> <li>Submissions should be in MS Office docx format.</li> <li>Right now, we are accepting translations from German, French, Italian, and Arabic. Please provide a scan or transcription of the untranslated text and a short summary when submitting.</li> </ul> <p><em>Relevance requirements</em> :</p> <ul> <li>The writing must have <em>theoretical</em> content. We are not interested in <em>feuilletonnage</em>, opinion pieces, musings on current events, or glorified diary entries. If you make claims, you must back them up. If you reference something, you must properly cite it. We expect a reasonable degree of seriousness and rigor.</li> <li>Critical theory, Marxism, socialism, communism, and everything in between is fair game, but our main focus is still Critical Theory, especially Early Critical Theory. This does not mean that pieces must engage with Critical Theory <em>narrowly</em> defined as the work of the Frankfurt School, but merely that it must engage with critical theory and/or Marxism, <em>broadly</em> defined.</li> </ul> <p><em>Further information</em> :</p> <ul> <li>We reserve the right to refuse to publish submissions, especially those that don’t meet our standards of quality and/or relevance.</li> <li>As our blog and journal is published under a Creative Commons license, others are free to republish, translate, <em>détourner</em>, and <em>umfunktionieren</em> our texts however they please—although we politely request that they provide credit and link back to our site when doing so.</li> <li>Please allow 2-3 weeks for the editorial board to get back to you with a decision.</li> <li>Please only submit one proposal at a time.</li> <li>Submissions should be sent via email to crittheoryworkgroup [at] gmail [dot] com</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>CTWG</name></author><category term="submissions"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blog submissions are now open!]]></summary></entry></feed>
